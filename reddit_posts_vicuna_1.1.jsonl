It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \\(twice\\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users\u2019 everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \\(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.\n\nIt is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC\u2019s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). \n\nNevertheless, today\u2019s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.\n\nMany of you have asked what comes next.

It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created. Those who thought that they\u2019d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet.

We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we\u2019d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. \n\nThe debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news.

What\u2019s different now?\u201d Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**\n\n# What is it?\n\nThe Congressional Review Act \\(CRA\\) is basically Congress\u2019s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC\u2019s order through a \u201cresolution of disapproval.\u201d This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC\u2019s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).\n\n# What\u2019s happening in Congress?\n\nNow that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! \n\n# What should I do?\n\nToday, we\u2019re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they\u2019re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.\n\nIf they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:\n\n\u201cMy name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I live in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I\u2019m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I\u2019d like to ask Senator/Representative\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC\u2019s repeal of net neutrality.\u201d\n\n# Pro tips:\n\n\\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. \n\n\\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents.

Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.\n\n\\-**Don\u2019t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish.

I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.\n \nWe are thankful for Ellen\u2019s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.\n \nWe\u2019re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of \u201ccofounder\u201d.\n \nA few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.\n \nSecond, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.\n\nThird, as a redditor, I\u2019m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I\u2019m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.\n \nAs a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we\u2019re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.\n\nIf the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve\u2019s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.\n \n \n[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.\n\nEllen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn\u2019t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.\n \n[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate\u2014he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.\n\n\nNOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.\n\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 132252"}

We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both.

The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment.

{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/announcements \nAuthor: KeyserSosa \nMedia: text \nTitle: We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \n**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit\u2019s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we\u2019ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. \n\n**What happened?**\n\nOn June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees\u2019 accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. \n\nAlthough this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.\n\nNow that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.\n\n**What information was involved?**\n\nSince June 19, we\u2019ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:\n\n* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**\n   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site\u2019s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit\u2019s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.\n   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you\u2019re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you\u2019ve been affected.\n* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**\n   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. \n   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don\u2019t have an email address associated with your account or your \u201cemail digests\u201d user preference was unchecked during that period, you\u2019re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. \n\nAs the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.\n\n**What is Reddit doing about it?**\n\nSome highlights.

We\u2019ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!\n\n**Why Polls?**\n\nIt can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of our recent test polls\n\n[Viewing the results of a poll on new Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/z45s3p889no41.png?width=2356&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbd040f5e79e93b503c0a2d61378470c478e2305)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trunks...the people have spoken](https://preview.redd.it/ptccsbp89no41.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c561ac017d3db3cfed95a49b5ec5dba5cc751d0)\n\n**Platform Support**\n\n* iOS: Supports poll creation and voting\n* Android: Supports poll creation and voting **(EDIT: there is a bug on old versions of Android that cause the app to crash for some redditors when they vote. Updating the app to the new version will fix it.)**\n* New Reddit (web): Supports poll creation and voting\n* Old Reddit (web): Does not support creation. At the bottom of a poll, redditors will see a link to view the poll. Clicking the link will open a new tab where they can view results and vote in the poll\n* Mobile web: Supports voting. No plans for poll creation support\n\nAnd now a poll...\n\n**With everything going on in the world, how are you feeling?**\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/fo7p5b)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 67903"}

Some critics have argued that legalization would lead to an increase in crime, while others have suggested that it could actually make police more effective at fighting crime.\nNew data suggests that the latter may be true. According to recent FBI statistics, crime clearance rates - the percentage of reported crimes that are solved by police - have increased significantly faster in Washington and Colorado than the rest of the country since legalization.\nIn 2018, Washington's crime clearance rate was 53%, up from 46% in 2012. Meanwhile, Colorado's clearance rate rose from 50% to 59%.

The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  \n\n\nStart-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.\n\n\nThis is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. \n\n\nThis is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).\n\nIn comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).\n\n\nWhat can we do to stop it?

The study, which was published in the journal Economics of Education Review, analyzed data from over 7,000 college students and found that the gender gap in grades disappeared once classes were held virtually.\nResearchers from the University of Michigan and the University of California, Los Angeles, found that male students had historically outperformed female students in traditional classrooms, with the gender gap in grades averaging around 8%. However, when classes were held online during the pandemic, this gender gap completely disappeared.\nThe researchers believe that this could be due to several factors, including changes in teaching methods, increased accessibility for students with children or other responsibilities, and reduced distractions in virtual environments.\n\"We suspect that the gender gap in education is partially driven\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 123831"}

From Arya's epic kill shot to Daenerys' emotional breakdown, there was no shortage of memorable moments that had us on the edge of our seats.\nBut one moment in particular has been causing quite a stir among fans online. During the final scene, which showed Tyrion walking through the ruins of King's Landing, many viewers noticed something strange.\nFor just a brief second, Tyrion appeared to be carrying a small, furry creature in his arms. Some eagle-eyed fans quickly identified it as a ferret, and the internet promptly exploded with speculation about what it could mean.\nOf course, this being \"Game of Thrones,\" there are countless theories floating around.

The game has been making headlines recently for all the wrong reasons though, as players have expressed their outrage over the game's microtransaction system.\nEA has implemented a system where players can earn credits by playing the game, which they can then use to purchase loot crates containing random items such as weapons, skins, and other cosmetics. However, the rate at which players earn credits is slow, meaning that it takes a significant amount of time to save up enough to buy anything substantial. As a result, many players have turned to the game's microtransaction store to purchase loot crates directly with real money.\nThe problem is that the cost of these loot crates quickly adds up, with some of the more expensive ones costing upwards of $20.

Your passion is inspiring, and our team hopes to provide as many answers as we can around your questions.  \n\nJoining us from our development team are the following:  \n\n * John Wasilczyk (Executive Producer) \u2013 /u/WazDICE  Introduction - Hi I'm John Wasilczyk, the executive producer for Battlefront 2. I started here at DICE a few months ago and it's been an adventure :) I've done a little bit of everything in the game industry over the last 15 years and I'm looking forward to growing the Battlefront community with all of you.\n\n * Dennis Brannvall (Associate Design Director) - /u/d_FireWall  Introduction - Hey all, My name is Dennis and I work as Design Director for Battlefront II. I hope some of you still remember me from the first Battlefront where I was working as Lead Designer on the post launch part of that game. For this game, I focused mainly on the gameplay side of things - troopers, heroes, vehicles, game modes, guns, feel. I'm that strange guy that actually prefers the TV-shows over the movies in many ways (I loooove Clone Wars - Ahsoka lives!!) and I also play a lot of board games and miniature games such as X-wing, Imperial Assault and Star Wars Destiny. Hopefully I'm able to answer your questions in a good way!\n\n * Paul Keslin (Producer) \u2013 /u/TheVestalViking  Introduction - Hi everyone, I'm Paul Keslin, one of the Multiplayer Producers over at DICE. My main responsibilities for the game revolved around the Troopers, Heroes, and some of our mounted vehicles (including the TaunTaun!). Additionally I collaborate closely with our partners at Lucasfilm to help bring the game together.\n\nPlease follow [the guidelines outlined by the Subreddit moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d0793/information_about_the_ama_on_wednesday) in posting your questions.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32626"}

A new policy requires those behind bars to spend up to $150 per year to read e-books, take online classes or use other forms of digital entertainment. This is a cruel and counterproductive move that punishes people who are already being punished by the criminal justice system. It's also part of a larger trend toward monetizing every aspect of incarceration, from phone calls to health care to basic necessities like toilet paper.\nThe idea that inmates should be forced to pay for their own imprisonment is deeply flawed. For one thing, it creates a financial barrier to education and rehabilitation, which can make it more difficult for people to successfully reenter society after they are released.

After writing a prize-winning short story about an algorithm that decides school grades based on social class, she found herself in a situation eerily similar to the one she had imagined.

As a result, she was not accepted for English at St. Andrews University, where she had hoped to study.\nJohnson's story, \"The Algorithm,\" won the George Orwell Prize for Political Fiction in 2018.

I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.\n\nI searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.\n\nThere are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it\u2019s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she\u2019d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I\u2019m a bit annoyed. \n\nI pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. \n\nNot to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it\u2019s just her?\n\nIt\u2019s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  \n\nI thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. \n\n[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)\n\nTL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn\u2019t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 183758"}

She told us how she didn\u2019t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. \n\nFast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. \n\nTL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. \n\nUpdate:  Thank you so much for all the love and support.

I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  \n\nThe fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I\u2019ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn\u2019t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn\u2019t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. \n\n\nSo since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It\u2019s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. \n\nAfter 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it\u2019s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. \n\nSo I\u2019m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I\u2019m turning the light on I realize:\n\nThe goddamn thing is dimmable. \n\n\nFor 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to \u201cdim\u201d. \n\nFuck me. \n\nTL;DR\n\nFor 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 148086"}

The answer to that? Delivery. \n\nFood ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. \n\nPertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. \n\nBoth dogs were in the neighbor\u2019s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog\u2019s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the \u201dvoice\u201d for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. \n\nPup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling \u201dRUNAWAY\u201d and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. \n\nI didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. \n\n\u201dIs that your dog?\u201d\n\nMy bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? \n\nI\u2019ll be nice because you brought my food. \n\nBut she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, \u201dokay weird\u201d but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking \u201cokay weird...\u201d again but didn\u2019t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. \n\nI went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. \n\nUh...ok? What\u2019s going on here?\n\nI go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn\u2019t notice me. I walk up like I\u2019m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you\u2019ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I\u2019m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. \n\nI don\u2019t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. \n\nI continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor\u2019s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. \n\nIt clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. \n\nNo hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver\u2019s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor\u2019s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn\u2019t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. \n\nHowever, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. \n\nI splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn\u2019t end worse. \n\nTL; DR\n\nOrdered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn\u2019t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn\u2019t get shot but got cake in the end.\n\nEdit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!\n\nTaking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case!

For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. \n\n-------------------------\n\nAnyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.\n\n\nAnyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. \n\n\nI end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. \n\n--------------------\n\nFor the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would \"go away in the winter\". \n\n\nAbout a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.\n\n\n**Worst mistake I have ever made.**\n\n\nYou see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. \n\n\nI screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. \n\n\n**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**\n\n\nTL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.\n\nEDIT 2: RIP inbox\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back\n\nEDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit's history. Lord save me.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 114574"}

I'm 6'2 and have a pretty \"tough-guy\" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.\n\nSo while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.\n\nI'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she \"needs to think about what kind of man\" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.\n\nLater on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.\n\nWe are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.\n\nTl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nShe's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what I'm puttin down. It's a silly thing to be mad about.\n\nAnd by popular demand: [It's shawl over for you hoes](https://imgur.com/a/XXCrcM5)\n\nEdit 2: [Shawlbro](https://imgur.com/a/ZvlS5N9)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 114503"}

It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit\n\nThis morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.\n\nSome of you won\u2019t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it\u2019s worth, I would never say things that, much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account, but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.\n\nThis was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again, some won\u2019t believe that and that\u2019s ok.\n\nIf you care, you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.\n\nI\u2019m sorry everyone.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning to repeal the existing net neutrality rules that protect our freedom and open access to the internet. This means that giant corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will have unprecedented control over what we see and do online. They could slow down or even block websites, throttle speeds, and charge extra fees for access to certain content. This would devastate small businesses, consumers, and marginalized communities who rely on the internet as a lifeline for information, communication, and commerce.\nWe cannot allow this to happen! We need to stand up and fight back against the FCC's plan to give Big Telecom complete control of our internet experience. We must demand that Congress take action to pass strong net neutrality laws that will protect our rights\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 151576"}

I put together an outfit that looked like a suit and put black tape over my lips to look like a mustache. at 6pm. I went inside the house. Shouted \"I'M HOME!!\" then sat next to him in the living room and started kicking my shoes while complaining about the state of the house at the top of my lungs. He glanced at me confused asking what I was doing. I ignored him then started yelling about the carpet being dirty, shower not ready, the kids needing to be quiet and so on.\n\nHe kept staring while mom and my siblings laughed.

My dad got the hint because this was the common phrase he uses daily. He went quiet and avoided looking at me. I stopped the act and told him I was trying to show him what he's like everyday when he comes home from work. He said nothing, just went outside and refused to speak to me.\n\n\nLater he went on about how I \"mocked\" and invalidated him.

He was adamant he didn\u2019t know anything about the credit card  or the apparent enquiries on his credit account about pay day loans. \nMy boyfriend is still refusing to open any fraud investigations against his family member and has said he will pay off the debt himself. \nBut.. \nSome other things came out during our conversation that he was hiding from me. \nLying has been a big issue of his during our whole relationship.

That was the last time I seen him in person. \nThis is how this man delt with an issue in our 5 year relationship. \nWe haven\u2019t spoke much since but I have definitely resigned to the fact my relationship is over. I think he is expecting me to forgive him like all the previous times. \nI have packed up his stuff and will return to him after my city comes out of our 6th lockdown. \n\nThere is a good ending to this story tho. \n\nI spoke with my mortgage broker and the housing developers. \nI can\u2019t afford the original townhouse I fell in love with alone but a smaller townhouse that I also loved came available and I\u2019ve been approved for this one.

So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call \"Jake\" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. \n\nWell 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me \"No, this is what is expected of you every night.\" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like \"Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change\" and \"You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work.\" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. \n\nI was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked \"Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this.\" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.\n\nI got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that \"I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby.\" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. \n\nSo AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because \"its a mothers job to deal with it\"?\n\nEDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 38267"}

Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\n\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\n\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?\n\nEdit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 38264"}

I didn\u2019t attend my son\u2019s wedding, I instead spent the evening with his ex wife. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nQuick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy. \n\nAfter the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn\u2019t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there\u2019s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. \n\nThey got into counseling, for a year things were \u2018ok\u2019 on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. \n\nBefore the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fianc\u00e9e around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. \n\nThe wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn\u2019t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid\u2019s attended their father\u2019s wedding. \n\nShe was taken aback that I didn\u2019t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she\u2019ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. \n\nThe next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.\n\n\n*****ETA: First, I\u2019d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can\u2019t go back and undo that. \n\nSo, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work\u2026DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s dead to me now.\u201d Time will tell if he means that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see this update too. For that reason, I\u2019m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won\u2019t be dead anymore. \n\nHis mom told him, \u201cYour children have to be our number one priority.\u201d They\u2019re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he\u2019ll understand this.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 38257"}

He makes 68k and I make 130k. I am a mechanical engineer at a robotics startup. He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company. \n\nHe brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs.\n\nI told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. \n\nOne of his friends asked about work and I said \"Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.\"\n\nI wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!  \n\nSome other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out\n\nI wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer\n\nIt got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.\n\nHe didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. \n\nI got irritated with his friends and asked \"Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?\" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying \"There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? \n\nMy boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.\n\nHe said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said \"at least they know I'm a rich bitch\" \n\nHe was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense.\n\nAITA for explaining why I'm not a gold digger?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 38223"}

He was getting uncomfortable. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nMy family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife\u2019s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren\u2019t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. \n\nWhen we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like \"Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.\" \n\nThis got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. \n\nAt the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. \n\nI told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. \n\nOverall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 38055"}

Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\nEdit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.\n\nI sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.\n\nEdit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.\n\nBUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.\n\nI am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \n\nI thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. \n\nThis post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37927"}

It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks. \n\nThe issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a \"what was that\" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying \"Yeah, *I* purchased my house\". I asked \"does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues.\" She grinned and said \"it's just for the record\" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied \"Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you.\" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar \"my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way.\" My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50.\n\nEdit: Holy hell this blew up. Sorry I wasn't clear with my friends being 50/50, half think I'm NTA and the others think we're both assholes and I shouldn't have escalated the problem.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37892"}

[Original post.](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oefrtm/aita_for_picking_out_the_peas_from_my_dinner_in/)\n\nThank you very much for your insight. I appreciate all the comments and also the awards. I think that's very cool to receive.\n\nSome comments said to talk about it with my mum. I did and it went very well. She said sorry and said it was not my fault. She explained to me how it went and I will try to tell it as short as possible:\n\nMum was very stressed because she never hosts dinners. She wanted her colleagues to like it. They requested the recipe. She forgot I don't eat peas because she was too busy with her colleagues.\n\nShe wanted me to eat with them because at her colleague's house his kids also ate with them. She didn't want to make a fuss about my autism because sometimes I'm rude when people ask about it. She said her head was all over the place all evening.\n\nI said to her that that's why I could have made my own food. She said that was difficult because there was no time for that. I didn't realise because I'm not good with time awareness. I asked her to communicate with me next time and be more clear about what I can or can't do. She said she will and said I can help cook next time too.\n\nAlmost every comment said that her boss was nice. He probably wasn't angry or upset with her. I told this to my mum. She said sorry to me again because she wasn't upset at me at all. She was embarrassed because she tried to get me to ''behave normally'' and she shouldn't have done that. She took it out on me on a whim.\n\nI also said sorry because I didn't realise that it could've been important for her work status. I just thought they were like friends. She said it was OK because I didn't make a big fuss and I didn't get loud or walk away. She's proud of me for staying at the table and also thinking about the ducks.\n\nWe concluded that we both learned things. I learned things because I now know more about work dinners and manners. She learned things because she now knows to communicate and explain more to me to avoid stress.\n\nIn the comments people also said her boss might have experience with autistic people. I asked my mum and it was a little bit sad. His little brother was autistic but he died 10 years ago. It made him sad because he loved him a lot.\n\nHe told her I should eat things I like next time because it upset him to think mum was worried about appearances so much that I had to be uncomfortable during dinner. He also said that dinner was really good and that he's happy to have her in his team at work. He's a good person and a good boss. I sent him a thank you email with my mum.\n\nLast thing is that I fed the ducks the peas. I think they were happy about it. The thing with ducks is that they don't say that to you of course. I got an ice cream with two scoops at the pond. I also got one for my mum because I had money left. It was a little bit melted when I came home because it was 5 minutes walking but she still liked it and she said I was amazing.\n\nThank you for reading.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37745"}

So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us. \n\nNick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. \n\nHe never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying \"sorry, you don't understand that, haha\".

My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. \n\nHe asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. \n\nI told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. \n\nHe was a angry and said I made a fool out of him.

They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. \n\nMy eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn\u2019t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don\u2019t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.\n\nA few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she\u2019d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. \n\nShe laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who \u201csheds like a gorilla\u201d and has produced \u201cthree skid marking sons\u201d which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it\u2019s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn\u2019t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can\u2019t be flushed and that it\u2019s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. \n\nI later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she\u2019s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. \n\nThis is a genuine issue to me and she didn\u2019t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA?\n\nUPDATE \u2014 Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive \u201cperiods for pricks\u201d course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter.

Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.\n\n\nShe'd barge in, then turns and says \"oh sorry\" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said \"so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!\". He seriously said that!.\n\n\nWe have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.\n\nSo I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she \"accidently\" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming \"she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom\". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel \"terrified/weirded out\" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.\n\n\nEdit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a \"me problem\" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close.\n\nShe developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.\n\nAnyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.\n\nI broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money.\n\nShe told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.\n\nFor the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.\n\nNow no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about.\n\nThank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touch\u00e9. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal:\n\nTurns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at.\n\nAnyhow, I called out of work sick the rest of the day and am going to drink a lot of alcohol. Like, a lot of alcohol. And then start thinking about what the fuck I'm going to do.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37449"}

I really thought she could handle the responsibility.  \n\nSo, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.   \n\nI call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.  \n\nI ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to \"take a mental health day and do some self-care\". I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: \"I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that.\".  \n\nFrankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  \n\nSo I told her that she had two choices:  \n\n1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  \n\n2) I fire her completely.  \n\nShe's calling me all sorts of \"-ist\" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. \n\nNone of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. \n\nI think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  \n\nBut at the same time, she really could have called me.  \n\n\nSo, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages.

He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother \"Ethan\" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.\n\n\nSome context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy \"Joey\" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.\n\n\nSo fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said \"Knock knock..\" Ethan laughed and said \"Who's there?\". Mike replied \"Joey's bio parents\" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an \"idiot\" to which Mike replied with \"Hey...Relax it was just a joke\". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.\n\n\nWe haven't talked to them for days.

Everyone was so kind, helpful and supportive. I recieved so many messages and I want to thank each one of you for them. They meant more to me than you know. \n\nWell, I've left my husband. And it really wasn't over this one incident, but really a build up of many. Before I even made the post, I wasn't completely blind to what he had been doing in terms of control. As weird as it seems, sometimes I just forget I am an adult and I don't have to just 'yes sir' and listen to any man thats older than me. **I'm** an adult now. I make my own rules. I feel sick saying this, but I realize I had been viewing him as a parental figure and not a partner. It kind of makes my stomach twist to even type that, but that is what it is. I don't really want to analyze it right now, its too gross. \n\nI'm honestly going through a really tough grieving time right now. I feel like such a failure. What's worse is that he does not care in the least. When I called him to tell him I was leaving, he said \"Ok. Let me know when you want to grab your stuff, we can have you moved out ASAP.\" And that was it. That was all he said before he hung up the phone. I'm really hurting. I loved him so much, and I think part of me just wanted to see if he was willing to fight for me and apologize. He was not, so thats that. \n\nBut, although I'm hurting, I feel free. My mom has welcomed me back, shes so happy I am divorcing him. I got together with my friends who he wouldn't let me see. I watched tv shows he told me were too childish. And Ive been wearing ugly sweatpants and oversize tshirts that he always said made me \"look like a man.\" \n\nSo thank you, all of you. I got a wakeup call I desperately needed. I don't even WANT to be a housewife. I never wanted that for me (no hate on anyone who does, honestly guys it was hard and lonely work). I am going to get my RN, and then move on to my masters.

Obviously, they can\u2019t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a \u201cZoom\u201d wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy sister didn\u2019t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. \n\nShe and her fianc\u00e9 decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fianc\u00e9 and quote \u201covershadow\u201d them on their big day \u201cthat was already scaled down\u201d. However, her and her fianc\u00e9 said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. \n\nFast-forward to the day of the wedding\u2014everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they\u2019d like to talk so it doesn\u2019t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he\u2019s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He\u2019s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like \u201c(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it\u2019s given me the courage to do this....\u201d then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??\n\nI immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he\u2019s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I\u2019s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. \n\nThe rest of the wedding went smoothly\u2014except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37275"}

My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.\n\nMy wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.\n\nI gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.\n\nI (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to \"even the score.\"\n\nI told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents.

My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.\n\nThey gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. \n\nI always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. \n\nA while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'. Even though I tried to, it's like I can't reply, this argument brought something very emotional up in me.\n\nAITA for hurting my parents over this, especially since I have never brought it up before?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37162"}

You should have never baked them at all- this whole issue is going to be bad for business.\u201d I went home feeling completely invalidated. She completely gaslit me. I read and reread some of your commends multiple times and decided to stand my ground on this. She didn\u2019t threaten to fire me or anything (not that she could have- she needed me) but she continued to guilt trip me and try to manipulate me into baking again. She even had some of the retreaters come to me offering me money to bake for the retreats. At this point it wasn\u2019t about the pay- it was how people were treating me. I refused and started applying to other jobs because I was sick of the environment. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m actually a licensed pharmacist. I was working for minimum wage at a quilt shop because I was burnt out in an over saturated and overworked field. I was depressed because i was a doctor of pharmacy- 8 years of college completed, and i didn\u2019t feel mentally fit for working in that field because of my mental health. I worked for this quilt shop for a year. I learned some things, got a break, and regained some of the mental health I lost. This cookie debacle was the push I needed to regain my self worth and go back to the field that I wanted to be in. Within a month I found a job as a pharmacist at a federal prison. I loved it from my first day. \n\nI\u2019ve been there a year now and I love every day of it. My job has meaning, my coworkers are awesome, and every day is a new experience. It took a few months, but I got my baking mojo back. I\u2019m known throughout the prison by my actual name and people come to visit the pharmacy for some cookies (or whatever baked good I decide upon) and they stay for conversation. I found a job I love and a group of people who appreciate my baking and don\u2019t use me as a cookie slave. Thanks, Reddit. You guys are awesome.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37149"}

I'm female 5'9\" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me \"slim\" and I even heard her say one time \"go ask toothpick\" and she has said stuff like \"you need some meat on your bones\" & \"you need to eat\". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. \n\nToday when she said \"morning slim\" I replied \"morning chunky\" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is \"different\" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a \"compliment\". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's \"a high school issue and we should figure it out\".\n\nEDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37100"}

My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.\n\nAfter the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.\n\nI have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to \"fuck off and go fuck themselves\" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.\n\nEdit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.\n\nEdit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 37095"}

I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town.\n\nWhen I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.\n\nI should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs.\n\nI should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair.\n\nSo, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.\n\nA couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, \"A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!\" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.\n\nEver since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. Very platonic. \n\nAnyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don\u2019t want \u201cthe public\u201d to know they are dating. I would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don\u2019t. Also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. \n\nAnyway I asked what they meant, and they said they didn\u2019t want to end up in gossip rags....\n\nI pointed out that they are not famous and that they don\u2019t even have functioning IMDb pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names. \n\nI think they\u2019re delusional but they\u2019ve been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened).

She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.\n\n\nI showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed.

I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender \"new skin\". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. \n\nIn some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.\n\nBut in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as \"the girl with the scar\" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.\n\nThis week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.\n\nI'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. \n\nIt also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.\n\nSo I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.\n\nI wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... \n\nHis father said to me, \"Can you cover that injury?\" \n\nI said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. \n\nHe started snapping at me saying \"there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.\"\n\nI said \"this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.\"\n\nHe started to backtrack saying \"just until it's healed\" and I said \"it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. \n\nHe actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.\n\nAITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 36659"}

My fianc\u00e9 got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left. \n\nLater my fianc\u00e9's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised.

I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something.\n\nOne morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren\u2019t adding up, so I decided to run a test.\n\nI waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am.

So you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?\u201d She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole.\n\nI did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up.\n\nSo, am I an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nMy wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public.\n\nI got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some \u201cfamily therapy.\u201d Apparently she finally wanted to talk.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m pretty pissed at the reason why she\u2019s been so hateful towards my cats. It\u2019s absolutely asinine.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s not sick physically or mentally. She\u2019s not bored of the relationship and looking for an \u201cout.\u201d*\n\nAccording to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She\u2019s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it\u2019s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them.\n\nI asked her why she didn\u2019t just tell me the truth and why she\u2019d been lying and refused to talk about it when I\u2019d asked. Her answer was \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have gotten rid of them otherwise.\u201d and explained that when she saw I wasn\u2019t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a \u201cgoal\u201d to have me pick her over them.\n\nSickening. Don\u2019t know why she actually admitted to it all.\n\nThe woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I\u2019m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I\u2019ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband.\n\nMy wife started shouting at me that I\u2019ve betrayed her and that I\u2019m \u201cscum\u201d for choosing animals over her. At least cats don\u2019t give ultimatums like she gave.\n\nIt sucks that she\u2019s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it\u2019s for the best right now. She\u2019ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know.\n\nI\u2019m almost sure I\u2019m going for divorce. I\u2019m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don\u2019t want to worry about them being harmed or \u201cdisappearing.\u201d Screw that.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll do what almost all of you suggested: \u201cKeep the cats, rehome the wife.\u201d Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn\u2019t always nice.\n\n**If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:**\n\n***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds.\n\n***I\u2019m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won\u2019t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules.\n\n***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I\u2019m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn\u2019t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn\u2019t, I generally assume they\u2019re lying. Shame on me.\n\n***If you want even more context/questions answered, simply go through my comment history.***\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 36457"}

He seems very respectful, just shy.  \n\nMy wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. \n\nSince my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. \n\nSome of the advice I\u2019ve heard my wife give is \u2018oh it\u2019s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!\u2019 Or \u2018oh honey don\u2019t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would\u2019 and similar. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away \u2018two people in a partnership should be contributing equally\u2019 and my personal favorite \u2018if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it\u2019s reasonable to split the payment\u2019. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven\u2019t been anywhere obviously since we\u2019re home but the way she talks about him \u2018oh I\u2019ll just ask him to pay for x\u2019 etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother\u2019s advice, i.e. \u2018if you really liked me you\u2019d pay for x\u2019 \n\nI spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it\u2019s a rite of passage for girls and it\u2019s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it\u2019s not cute for her to be thinking it\u2019s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 36328"}

I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. \n\nA week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. \n\nSo I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like \"Fucking fat bitch\" under her breath but nothing directly to me. \n\nSo Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 36293"}

The kid is super whinny and pretty spoiled because gf dotes on her so I usually just stay in my room.\n\nToday gf was taking her daughter on a \"special outing\" because she passed a math test, and my dad suggested I go with them for a \"girls day out\". I wanted to say no but I knew that he wanted me to get to know his gf and gf's daughter better so I agreed. He gave gf $300 to spend during the outing.\n\nWe spent the day going in and out of stores gf's daughter liked in the mall complex. Gf ended up buying her a shit ton of clothes, makeup, and other stuff I don't remember. On our way back home gf stopped at the Starbucks cause daughter wanted a drink and some cakepops. She ordered a drink for her and her daughter and 2 cake pops. I asked her if I could get something and she said she ran out of money and she'd \"get me something next time\".

When we got back home my dad saw their drinks and asked where mine was. I told him that \"I wasn't allowed to get one cause I don't deserve it\".

The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. \n\nIt was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\n\nToday I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined. \n\nI have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired.

A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). \n\nOur counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said \"honestly, no\". \n\nI love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. \n\nMy wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old \"daddy wishes you were never born\" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.\n\nYes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. \n\nIt has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. \n \nAITA for saying it though?\n\nEdit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. \n\nWhen I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. \n\nYeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  \n\nJust because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. \n\nMy first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.\n\nRegarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 36009"}

We had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....\n\nMiles Trayvon\n\nWe thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be \"Tray\" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, \"This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence.\" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.\n\nI had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, \"Her name is Daisy.\" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put \"Ray Smith\", Demarcus Jones would put \"Marcus Jones\", Keshawnda Nelson would put \"Shawna Nelson\", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone.

This was very helpful as I did not want him to feel pressured to come out.\n\nWhen I wrote my original post, I was already watching Schitt's Creek, which had non-straight main characters. This was really convenient because I could simply say remarks like \"Awww, they make a really nice couple\" and \"Wow, I wish my relationship with my gf was like that.\"\n\nI also asked my bro about Pride month (he has been going to marches as an ally for the past few years with his out friends). I asked him \"Hey, what's their plan for Pride month during quarantine? Too bad they can't hold the march, I was thinking of joining.\"\n\nI didn't really know how to be subtle, okay.\n\nWhen our parents went grocery shopping last weekend, that's when he told me. \"You already know, don't you?\" I knew what he was asking but I tried to play dumb. \"You know, that I'm gay, right?\"\n\nI just said yes, told him about the iPad incident, and hugged him. He cried and asked me not to tell our parents, which of course I agreed to. He then asked if this changes anything between us, to which I replied \"Of course, now you have to give me better fashion advice!\" (I make jokes when I'm emotional, okay)\n\nI told him he has my support no matter what, and that I can help him come out to our parents when he's ready. I also told him that he and his boyfriend (which he confirmed) are a great couple, then I reminded him that they should always be \"safe\" (Giving sex advice to my brother was VERY awkward).\n\nThat's it. He's still annoying as hell, because, you know, he's my brother, but I've never seen him happier, and I can really feel that a burden has been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\nEDIT: I just realized that it's now June! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH, EVERYONE!\n\nEDIT2: Wow, this kinda blew up! I was just doing what any caring brother would do, and I'm glad it has a positive effect on other people. I was raised with values to love and accept everyone, regardless of gender/sexuality, so that will never change especially for my bro. Again, thank you for the overwhelming support!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35789"}

There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.\n\nHowever, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be \"the good ol' salads & appetizers\" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served \"salad\". my fiance made a face and said \"isn't that what vegans eat?\". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.\n\n\nThe other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.\n\n\nAITA for putting my foot down on this?\n\nUPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to \"address\" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept \"acting dismissive\" of her son's input and \"contributations\" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying \"I paid for it\" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of \"my money, I paid for it\" mentality. She finally mentioned how \"bad\" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my \"weird\" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and \"the family\" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.\n\nI'll update if there's anything worth adding after we talk.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35749"}

My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.\n\nMy son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.\n\nI asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a \"test run\" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.\n\nWe had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.\n\nI was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his \"first experience\" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.\n\nAITA?\n\nINFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one!

I didn\u2019t have a shitty childhood. The favoritism started when my sister was diagnosed. I moved out soon after and have been pretty independent since then. Not saying that how my parents treated me during those years were a-ok, but I wasn\u2019t Cinderella.\n\n2. I did not drink myself into oblivion. I had two white wine spritzers. But I appreciate the concern from folks!\n\nAnyhow, the update:\n\nI got in touch with my sister and asked her to meet up again at a park (no bill involved). I asked her if she was pregnant and she told me the truth. She said she wanted us to still be in each other\u2019s lives and that she wanted me to be in her baby\u2019s. A redditor (and I forget who, I\u2019m sorry) mentioned that she may ask me to be the godmother and that person was correct. But as many of you pointed out \u2014 if I didn\u2019t cut her off, I\u2019d just become her bank and daycare employee. So I told her I could no longer be in her life. And I left her crying on a park bench and felt like the shittiest person in the world.\n\nI emailed my parents and told them how betrayed I felt and that I\u2019d be cutting off contact with them. To my stepmom\u2019s credit, she apologized. She explained that she never thought my sister would live to have kids and that she let her emotion over that get the better of her. Understandable. My dad said nothing, which is honestly what sucked the worst about all of this.\n\nBen tried messaging me from a burner account for the first time since the break-up but I blocked him without reading it.\n\nI didn\u2019t go nuclear and post the story to Facebook as some suggested but I sent an email to the extended family members who I care about. I explained the situation and how I\u2019d be distancing myself from my family. Some have made it an us-versus-them situation and as much as I appreciate the support, feeling like I\u2019m in some valiant battle just makes me more tired. So I haven\u2019t been talking to much of anyone in my family.\n\nI feel lonely and crappy, but I think I made the right decision.\n\nAnyhow, not the most exciting update in the world but hopefully everyone knows that I\u2019m not dead. I do really appreciate the support I\u2019ve gotten \u2014 it made me smile during a really shitty time.\n\nAnd hey, if anyone in the greater Boston area wants an extra guest at Thanksgiving, lemme know.\n\nTL;DR: Ended up cutting off my family.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35502"}

It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. \n\nA minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.\n\nShe just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.\n\nI thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. \n\nIt bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.\n\nI sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)\n\nAnyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.\n\nI said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. \n\nHowever, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.\n\nI also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the \"do not hire\" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. \n\nShe fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.\n\nAITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35467"}

My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.\n\nI handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself \"well, at least she cooks for us!\".\n\n\nLast night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was \"probably\" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said \"Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry\". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't \"show up for dinner\" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said \"I don't know, maybe save some food for me?\" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life \"on pause\" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.\n\n\nHe picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me \"nuts\" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over \"food\".\n\n\n\n**Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**\n\n\n**one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he \"can't come\" see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came**\n\n\n**Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me \"for real this time\" ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!**\n\n\n**Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also \"talk\" (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35332"}

I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.  \n\nMy husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. \n\nThis is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. \n\nMy company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.\n\nIt\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. \n\nI asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. \n\nHe was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible. \n\nHe continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife. \n\nI feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check. \n\nI told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. \n\nI feel fucking awful. I still love him.

A lot has happened since my OP\n\nI spoke to the manager of the dental practice. I explained that my boyfriend (BF) had been open to me about not paying and that he doesn\u2019t plan to. The manager said a letter was already on the way demanding the payment, and if BF fails to pay then court proceedings will begin. He was thankful I called and knew it was their mistake, but was surprised by my BF\u2019s attempts to argue with him. That\u2019s a good result for now. \n\nI didn\u2019t plan on telling my BF as I wanted to end it (there\u2019s been too many red flags, so I decided I couldn\u2019t ever truly trust him) and I didn\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire. But before I got to end our relationship in person, I learnt another painful lesson. \n\nRecently my BF\u2019s laptop broke. This was fine as it was old and he can\u2019t work from home anyway (he sells cars), so he\u2019s used mine. Earlier this week I\u2019m on my laptop working and go to check my personal emails, except my BF\u2019s email was still logged in when I opened the webpage. I go to log out but saw the most recent 30 ish emails were all from the same person, a girl. This was weird as who emails like that to converse anymore? I know it was an invasion of privacy, but I clicked onto the emails. \n\nI deduced this was a girl from his work, they were emailing because her mobile phone was broken, and emailing him from her work email during the day was an easy way for them to still talk. The emails were flirtatious. They mentioned dates they\u2019d been on, he\u2019d clearly been to her house, they spent lunch breaks together and she thought he was single. The more I read the more enraged I became. What if I\u2019d never clicked the email? After considering where I could bury him, I decided to remain calm. \n\nI called my manager to tell her what I\u2019d just learned, she\u2019s super cool and said to take the afternoon. I then called an emergency locksmith and packed up my BF\u2019s stuff (he alternates between staying at mine and his mums), except for his PS5 I bought for his 25th birthday last month. When this purge of my BF from my life was ready, I text him: \n\n \u201cI know about S. Our relationship is over, your things are on the doorstep. You must transfer me the money for XYZ. Please don\u2019t ever contact me again.\u201d\n\nAnd blocked him on everything.\n\nA little while later, there\u2019s knocking are at my door as he\u2019s pleading to be let in to talk about it. I can see him but stay silent where he can\u2019t see me. He was on his knees crying, begging, pleading for me not to leave him. Whether they were crocodile tears or not, my heart *ached*. After some time he left with his stuff. I felt relief and had a good cry, but I doubt that\u2019s the last I\u2019ll hear from him.\n\nI feel heartbroken, and stupid. An enormous thank you to all those who said his behaviour was revealing of his character/what he\u2019s capable of, I will apply the same vigilance to future partners. I know this is a dodged bullet, but it hurts like hell.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust wanted to clarify some things: \n\n- I kicked him out of *my* house. I own it, he\u2019s never paid anything towards it and has no documentation linking him to my house. He alternates between staying at mine and his mother\u2019s, with his mother\u2019s being his official and primary residency. \n\n- Weirdly, some of you were really focused on the fact I kept the PS5. But I paid for it, have the receipts and it never left my home. I feel like retracting this gift he\u2019s had little over a week as an asshole tax is morally justified after he\u2019s been a 5* asshole. (And last time I checked this was a moral judgement not a legality sub?). \u2026I think they\u2019d be very different comments if this was the other way round and he\u2019d just given me an engagement ring and then found out I was cheating not even 2 weeks later. Yes it\u2019d be mine under the jurisdiction of a gift, but is it morally right I get to keep the ring? Probably not.\n\n- I noted down the email of the girl my ex was cheating with in case I wanted to contact her directly. I was thinking of constructing a message explaining everything and assuring her I\u2019m not bitter towards her. Then it\u2019s up to her what she wants to do with that info.\n\nThanks so much for all the supportive messages and comments, I am reading every single one. I\u2019m honestly shocked at the amount of kindness from strangers!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 35265"}

My wife needed to take our son to an appt nd I needed to WFH today so my MIL came to watch after our daughter.\n\nMy daughter needed to use the bathroom, and I was going to excuse myself from my online meeting but my MIL said she had it. A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded.

I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out.

On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn\u2019t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I\u2019d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn\u2019t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s still always \u201cforgetting\u201d where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we\u2019ve put locks on the rooms we don\u2019t want her in, there isn\u2019t really a problem anymore.  \n\nWell over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn\u2019t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn\u2019t need to lock the doors since she wouldn\u2019t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  \n\nI did this once before when husband didn\u2019t believe me about the snooping to prove she\u2019d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn\u2019t say anything about it but then my husband couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. \n\nHusband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There\u2019s a  baby gate so the kids can\u2019t get upstairs either. \n\nWell guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I\u2019m the asshole.  MIL also says I\u2019m the asshole but SIL says I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it\u2019s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA?\n\nETA: I can\u2019t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple\u2019s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.  \n\nI will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.  \n\nAnd if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34975"}

She's an absolute sweetheart of a baby, and I'm totally in love with her. Between March and May, I didn't get to see her at all in person, but I was doing regular FaceTime/House Party calls with Stephanie and Karen, and over the last few weeks, I've been going over to Stephanie's house to sit in her backyard and chat with Stephanie/coo at Karen from a lengthy distance.\n\nI have two reasons for updating. First, I've realized since Karen's birth that her name has taken on new meaning to me. When I'm with her, Karen just means *her*, and I don't think about the other connotations. In other words, you guys were right!\n\nThat said, though, my second reason for updating is that Stephanie got back into her years-unused Facebook at the beginning of the pandemic to keep in touch with people. She's been on it pretty regularly lately for the first time in years (historically, she's not really been into social media). Most people in our area/social circle have been posting really heavily about BLM and the protests happening right now, as well as racial justice issues more generally. As a result, Stephanie has now come into contact with a *deluge* of Karen memes for the first time, and found them confusing and horrifying, especially the use of \"Karen\" as shorthand for a racist. I've basically just declined to talk about it with Stephanie, because it went so poorly last time, but both *my* mother and *her* mother have hounded me about it because it's upsetting to Stephanie, and said things like, \"Is *this* what you were talking about before? Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you explain it better?! You should have told Stephanie!!\"\n\nAnd Jesus wept!! You really can't win.\n\nThanks again for all your feedback on my last post! It was very helpful in giving me some Zen about the situation.\n\nEdit: Wow, I've been super overwhelmed by the *flood* of very kind, heartfelt PMs (and just one or two not so kind ones) as well as the comments on my other post. Thank you, everyone! It continually amazes me how many nice and empathetic people frequent a sub devoted to assholes.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34889"}

I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.\n\u200b\n\nFive months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said \"This is John\" and described my job.\n\n\u200b\n\nTed: \"Hi, Jack.\"\n\nMe: \"It's John.\"\n\n\u200b\nTed: \"What?\"\n\u200b\n\nMe: \"My name's John, not Jack.\"\n\nTed: \"It's close enough for me.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nThis continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him \"You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nHis response was \"Sure thing, Jackie boy.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSince I don't work directly with him, I figured \"screw it\" and that I'd ignore him.\n\n\u200b\n\nRecently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says \"Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!\"\n\n\u200b\n\n(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)\n\n\u200b\n\nAs promised, I ignored him.\n\n\u200b\n\n7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.\n\nThe first one was along the lines of \"Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.\"\n\nE-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.\n\n\u200b\n\nI signed out and went home. It was raining hard.\n\nNext morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams \"Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!\" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor: \"Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.\n\nSupervisor: \"I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt.\" he sighed and said \"With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.\n\n\u200b\n\n*AM* I the a-hole on this?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34708"}

It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.\n\nWe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.\n\nCue a question I drew: \"What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?\"\n\nSome backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.\n\nI didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, \"Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\nEveryone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said \"well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nIf things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement.

My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now.\n\nMy sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment.\n\nThey finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran.

Other family members think I was too harsh as they\u2019re grieving, but I don\u2019t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34526"}

My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me.\n\nSince school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.\n\nSo I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34471"}

When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \n\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \n\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34444"}

While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as \"liberal\", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n\nMy parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.\n\nAs I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.\n\nAnna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.\n\nNo advice needed, but I have to know.

My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own).\n\nMy brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me.\n\nNote that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though.\n\nAnyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week. \n\nThe fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: \"you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later.\" He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified.\n\nThey asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34357"}

Many of you asked for an update, so here goes:\n\nLast weekend, the girls were at their mom\u2019s. After she dropped them off Sunday night, my 12yo asked to talk to me in private. We went into her room, and she showed me two recordings she\u2019d taken on her phone; one of my ex trying to convince them I was abusing them, and one of her and her husband arguing about how much she was paying in child support, and I\u2019ll be honest here - my cousin is a family court lawyer and basically raked her over the coals. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but I was still extremely hurt over the affair. I even got alimony.\n\nAnyway, my 12yo told me she didn\u2019t want to go to her mom\u2019s anymore, but she said she felt she had to because she\u2019s the oldest sibling and it\u2019s her job to protect the younger ones. I\u2019ve always instilled this value in her (I\u2019m an oldest child myself) but seeing this just made me even more upset, because now it\u2019s just another battle she\u2019s fighting that she shouldn\u2019t be. She\u2019s also just started to figure out that her mom cheated, and over the past couple weeks she started firing tons of questions at me about the timeline of their relationship I couldn\u2019t really answer, and after showing me the recordings, she literally demanded I answer her, yes or no, did her mom cheat on me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I told her the truth, with the promise she wouldn\u2019t tell her sisters (as much it sucks, that\u2019s my job, not hers). The way she cried on my shoulder was the most heartbreaking thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, but she was catching on and I figured if she\u2019s going to find out regardless, it should be in a setting where she\u2019s comfortable. After she was done crying, I told her to email me the recordings she took, and called my cousin.\n\nWe\u2019ve just started the paperwork, but my cousin is certain we can get my ex nailed for parental alienation, and since she got a promotion a few months ago, I should be able to renegotiate the child support payments as well. Most importantly, the recordings should be enough to give me grounds for supervised visits only, which is what I want. I still want the girls to have a relationship with their mom (especially since the younger two still want to see her), I\u2019m just going to have to make sure I\u2019m present at all times when they\u2019re with her. Coparenting is oodles of fun, kids! \n\nAnyway, I also want to give a huge thank you to all the supportive comments and messages. I only saw most of the DMs recently because I use the Reddit is Fun app on my phone and for some reason it doesn\u2019t show chatroom messages. I\u2019m not the best with technology, seeing as my most valuable job skill is herding 5yos, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for any other career.

The post didn\u2019t get a lot of attention but the attention it did get was controversial and there was a lot of differing opinions so I figured I\u2019d do an update as a lot has happened. \n\nSo after I posted I ended up contacting the girlfriends in the group to see what was up and we started noticing some fishy stuff. Their boyfriends and the guys in the group would say the exact same things to them as they did to me. Stuff like we\u2019d invite you but then the other girls will want to come. We also figured out that there were other nights that all the guys were free but that wanted to do Saturday\u2019s for some reason. One of the girls, H, was suspicious for this any many other reasons so she checked her boyfriends phone (I don\u2019t condone what she did at all btw, but in this circumstance I excuse it). While looking she found a group chat called \u201cboys night\u201d which she had never heard of. She was super suspicious at this point and clicked it to be greeted by a bunch of very interesting messages from the boys in our group. \n\nWell guess what? Turns out \u201cguys night\u201d was really \u201cgo to a pub and cheat on your girlfriend night\u201d. The message was in reference to one of the girls my boyfriend was sleeping with last week. In fact, all the other guys except one were cheating, while the other knew but kept quiet. Another lovely discovery from the chat was that he hasn\u2019t been using protection with the other women or with me (birth control), meaning not only has he been cheating he has also been putting me a high risk of an STD, while also risking mine and my elderly grandfathers life because of COVID.\n\nNeedless to say we\u2019ve broken up and I feel better for it, but right now I\u2019m friendless, single and waiting on STD results which doesn\u2019t feel fantastic. \n\nSo yep. Definitely not the update I was hoping to do but life clearly doesn\u2019t turn out the way you plan.\n\nEdit: wow I really was not expecting this response. Thankyou for all the kind words. I\u2019m at work at the moment and will try to respond as much as possible but from the bottom of my heart Thankyou all. And also Thankyou for the award I\u2019m very overwhelmed by all the kindness\n\nEdit 2: Thankyou again for all the kindness- I just thought I\u2019d add a few things. 1. Covid isn\u2019t bad where I am (Aus) but when we hang out we social distance with masks- you can\u2019t social distance during sex which is where my fear of covid comes from 2. One of the girls dumped her boyfriend (who wasn\u2019t cheating but knew) and the other took him back (he was cheating) and finally 3. I\u2019m STD free!!! I got a call an hour ago and am so completely relieved- now I can start to move on.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34266"}

His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.\n\n\nI hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this \"vision\" she has for the wedding and how it should be.\n\n\nShe insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that \"she always pictured her son's bride in it\" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her \"vision\" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had \"envisioned\" myself wearing at my wedding!.\n\n\nShe got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and \"turned down\" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked \"what process?\" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that \"both dresses weren't that much different anyway\" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.\n\n\nAnyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress \"a chance\". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a \"vision\" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.\n\n\nMom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and \"go with the flow\" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?.

They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. \n\nI found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story.

I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. \n\nThey all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA?

Matter of fact, she hasn't reached out to either one of us since then (we also didn't reach out to her). Unfortunately, B's words from that day really got to friend A. She struggled with survivors guilt and questioned her upbringing/lifestyle, views on religion, etc. She doubled her therapy sessions and I spent my free time keeping her company.   \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I went over to her place and found her reading a bible and (almost obsessively) flagging pages. She said she was researching to check if what B told her was true. She started reading excerpts and telling me her interpretations. This behavior did scare me a bit, so I suggested she bring this up to her therapist (it was the only thing I could think of to help calm her down). She did talk to the therapist who suggested she perhaps talk to a pastor instead of trying to come up with her own conclusions. She asked me to go with her, which I did, but told me to just wait for her at the church while she talked to the pastor privately. After, she said that she felt better and was more convinced that B was full of it. She also seemed calmer, so I believed that conversation did help her. \n\nI was at her house on Friday and she told me that she still thinks about what was said and, although she feels much better after talking to the pastor, he's only one person and what if he is wrong? I tried to reassure her again and talk through her feelings, but I could tell it was still eating at her. I had a feeling she might spiral again. Then I had an idea. I told her about the post I made on here and explained why, how it works, etc. (she's not a Reddit user). I pulled up my original post and asked her to read the comments to show her how hundreds of people (religious and non-religious) felt about what was said. We spent the evening reading each comment, she cried, she laughed, she was surprised and overwhelmed at the amount of support and reassuring words from all these strangers. I could tell she was more and more relieved as we read. She has been in a much better state of mind since then, so seeing hundreds of people disagree with B's words definitely had a positive impact on her. \n\nSo dear Redditors, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping my friend with your kind words and reassurance! She has a long road ahead of her in this grieving process, but she's going strong.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34114"}

Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.\n\nWhen I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was \"cooler\" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like \"fatass\" and \"chubster\". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).\n\nBy the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, \"He's still pretty big\", \"Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness\", \"Maybe lose a little more around that gut\". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.\n\nNow here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, \"Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?\" I flipped out. I yelled, \"Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?\"She said back to me, \"Defensive much?\"  \n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?\" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. \"Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!\" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, \"Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!\"  \n\"But you're way older!\" she whined.\n\nI left the table too and went home.

And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not \"bordering\" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34050"}

I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can\u2019t find out why.\n\nTo answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn\u2019t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it\u2019s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don\u2019t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34033"}

I want to thank you all for the kind words and comments. I knew after reading the comments that it was time to come to a resolution. I decided to drive home from work and talk with Erica. When I showed up Leah\u2019s car was parked in the drive. I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn\u2019t then I\u2019m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I\u2019m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said \u201cthose people don\u2019t understand our relationship or Leah\u201d. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she\u2019ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can\u2019t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She\u2019s locked herself in our room now. I\u2019m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn\u2019t know this but her parents said it\u2019s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn\u2019t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn\u2019t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone. Can\u2019t wait to take my clubs out and play a round now that I have more free time. Really excited to see what single life brings and can\u2019t thank you all enough again. \n\n\n\nMe (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don\u2019t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she\u2019s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples\u2026\n\nShe always brings her boyfriend over and he\u2019s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I\u2019m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn\u2019t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn\u2019t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don\u2019t remember\u201d. I told her at this point I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off. \n\nFinal straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I\u2019m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it\u2019s her best friend and that wasn\u2019t fair to do to her in our house. I said it\u2019s a pattern and since Erica\u2019s stuff isn\u2019t affected she doesn\u2019t care. I said she can go over to Leah\u2019s if she wants to see her. She said she can\u2019t do this because Leah doesn\u2019t like her apartment and Leah\u2019s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable. I\u2019m now getting the silent treatment and getting called an AH but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 34030"}

They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.\n\nMy sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.\n\nAnyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be \"ignoring my son's obvious speech issues.\" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.\n\nThis really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in \"bad\" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, \"Pass *us* the peas, will you\". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.\n\nEveryone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.\n\nShould I just apologise?\n\n**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**\n\n**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to \"keep the peace\"). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**\n\n**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**\n\n**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33871"}

So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \n\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \n\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. Que sera, sera. \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33760"}

Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John\u2019s parents AND his childhood best friend \u201cDan\u201d and his wife decided to move here as well.\n\nThis past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a \u201cdistanced picnic\u201d at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to \u201cjokingly\u201d rip on him for being \u201cwhipped\u201d and doing \u201cmy\u201d job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be \u201callowed\u201d to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how \u201cmean\u201d I was for not \u201cfixing him a plate\u201d and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families \"do it right\", where they handle the \u201coutside chores\u201d while their wives handle the \u201cinside chores\u201d (including the care of Dan and his wife\u2019s two children). I think it\u2019s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have \u201coutdoor chores\u201d, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.\n\nThe whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to \u201cgo for a walk\u201d and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for \u201cmaking \\[him\\] look bad\u201d in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how \u201ca traditional division of labor\u201d is \u201ca huge part of southern culture\u201d, and how I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his background by \u201cforcing northern culture\u201d onto him and his family. He said he\u2019s been building up a lot of \u201cresentment\u201d the past few months that I \u201cmake\u201d him do half the chores and childcare, since in his \u201cculture\u201d, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.\n\nI was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how \"southern hospitality\" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. \n\nJohn is livid and says his \"culture\" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not \"compromising\" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his \"culture\" was \"Islamic or Asian or whatnot\".\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33701"}

My husband denied that and said that my daughter was making up excuses to not have to spend time with his kids.\n\n\nFor this issue, I figured that a family trip is what the family need to get together and spend more time around each others. My husband liked the idea but said that his kids are now \"uncomfortable\" around my daughter because of her \"attitude\" and suggested we let her stay home and have the house all to herself since that's \"what she always wanted\". I told him it's best that we all go. he kept complaing til I snapped and told him to stop\n\n\nI booked (paid) for the whole family. However, my daughter told me she couldn't find her passport. We turned the house upside down looking for it but couldn't find it. My husband said maybe it was a sign from God that we should let her stay home so the trip wouldn't turn into a disaster. I ignored his comment but later while I was cleaning his office I found the passport, tucked away in the 3rd drawer under a ton of papers. I was floored by this, I confronted him with it and he swore he had no idea why or how the passport got there. I checked the upstairs camera and saw him enter my daughter's room.

He started arguing saying I overreacted and that he didn't want his kids to be \"miserable\" on the trip and that willing to apologize to my daughter if and *when* I reconsider my decision regarding the cancellation of the trip, because my stepkids will be devastated but I said it was final and that it was done.\n\n\nHe become cold and distant and said that he wants to take some time to do some fasting and get guidance from God about how he should deal with the disrespect and control I had displayed lately.\n\n\nAITA for cancelling it altogether?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33678"}

I am sick of being a part of it, I had \"NO PHOTOS\" hoodies printed for me and my little sister. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. \n\nIt sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.\n\nI found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.\n\n\"No photos\" \"no videos\" \"i do not consent to be photographed\" \"no means no\" \"respect my privacy\" \"no cameras\" \"no profiting off my image\"\n\nIt sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.\n\nAnd I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.\n\nMy mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking\n\nBut I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.\n\nAnd I'm always like \"no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. \n\nI am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.\n\nI know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.\n\nEdit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and \"no means no\" and \"this body is my own\" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a \"gangster hoody\". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree\n\nAITA for always wearing my no photos hoodie?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33623"}

We're talking about making it a home for both of us.\n\nBut as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. \n\nWhen his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. \n\nWhen I am bothered, she's like \"I was just helping with chores\" etc. He says I should just let her because she has \"a lot of nervous energy\" \n\nOne thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little \"affirmation\" post it note on my monitor saying \"I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things\" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. \n\nAnyway, she made a comment to about my ego... \n\nBut as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of \"affirmations\" to hide.\n\nSome were:\n\nMedicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!\n\nKitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!\n\nWork desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! \n\nWalk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!\n\n\nThere were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. \n\nNext time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. \n\nI went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. \n\nHe asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? \n\nHe said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.\n\nI was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit\"\n\nHe asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.\n\nHe said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!\n\nAITA for the note prank?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33596"}

He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. \n\nWe always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. \n\nWe were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. \n\nWe decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. \n\nTurns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. \n\nI\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ?\n\nHi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i\u2019ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I\u2019ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fianc\u00e9 bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they\u2019re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I\u2019d mail the ring but as for me and her, we\u2019re done and to tell my parents the same. I\u2019m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don\u2019t turn to a bottle again and go off again.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33517"}

I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.\n\nShe exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.\n\nAfter her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.\n\nBut I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.\n\nHer boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever.

I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.\n\nMy wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. \n\nHe said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. \n\nWell, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33507"}

Unfortunately, I'm wrong.\n\nI gave my oldest two weeks to really think about whether he wanted to talk to my sister or not. I figured that the decision he made at first might have been made out of anger, so I wanted to give him time to make such an important decision.\n\nUltimately, he decided that he did actually want to talk to her. I have to admit I was a little bit surprised, but we set up a zoom call between them anyway (of course with me supervising). Right before the zoom call he admitted to me that he wanted to talk to her, \"Just to see if she'll say sorry,\".\n\nShe did not say sorry.\n\nActually she opened the call with, \"Hello! It's been so long! I guess you're ready come home with me now?\", and then she noticed that I was sitting there with him, and almost immediately launched into accusations about \"alienation\" and how I \"have to give the kids back now or she'll call the police and say I kidnapped them,\". My oldest was very obviously disgusted. He asked her if she was going to apologize to him, and she actually had the audacity to ask what she had to apologize for.\n\nAt that point, he just shut off the zoom call. I asked him if he was okay, but he spent the rest of the afternoon in his room by himself.\n\nThat night he told me that he never wanted to talk to her again, ever. I told him that never is a long time, but that we weren't going to make him talk to her if he didn't want to, and we were never, ever going to give him back to her.\n\nHe told me that never is a long time. We told him that in this case, it meant never.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still shocked. I don't know what happened to my sister. She was my best friend as a kid. She was almost my second mother. She was sweet and caring and nice, I just don't know how all that changed so fast. Or maybe it didn't change that fast and I just never noticed until it was too late and I was driving four hours away at midnight to pick up three little kids, one of which I didn't even know existed.\n\nBefore now, I honestly never considered myself as their parent, even after I legally adopted them. More like I was just taking care of them long term. But now I realize that those kids are my kids. And they're going to be my kids for the rest of my (and hopefully their) lives.\n\nThank you for all of your help, guys. I hope you all have a fantastic day.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33508"}

I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  \n\nBoth of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  \n\nMy dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  \n\nOver Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  \n\nMy parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  \n\nI went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  \n\nI packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  \n\nI'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  \n\nI just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  \n\nMy oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  \n\nMy parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  \n\nI'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    \n\nI feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.\n\n#EDIT\n\nAll the chores were split fairly.  I wasn't doing any more than anyone else.  I thought it was fair until I was asked to out in money as well.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33491"}

I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say \"OK I get it\" and \"I won't do it again\".\n\nDays ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.\n\nHours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\nHe pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.\n\nNote: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33440"}

My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.\n\nDad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.\n\nWhen I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.\n\nIn 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.\n\nDad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33354"}

For a while I\u2019ve told my wife that none of her family members notice me or care about anything I do on Christmas Eve but they insist on me attending. She told me that\u2019s not true, they genuinely like me and enjoy talking to me. But I know that the only times they\u2019ve included me I had to basically insert myself into conversations and it feels awkward and unnatural. \n\nSo I had a wager with my wife. Bring my twin brother Steve instead of me, and see if anyone notices. I purposefully did not prep Steve on anything, he went in completely clueless (he knew why we were doing it and was game. I gave him $20.)  \n\nAs I suspected, Steve confirmed that he wasn\u2019t approached all night, nobody could tell he wasn\u2019t me, and he admitted he even felt excluded and he could only imagine how I felt. \n\nSo this morning on Christmas I invited Steve to join (normally he\u2019s with my mom and dad every year as he\u2019s not married or in a relationship.) they know about him obviously but didn\u2019t know about the switcheroo. That was when I revealed that last night \u201cI\u201d was Steve and expressed disappointment that nobody noticed and said this is why I stopped trying, nobody talks to me. \n\nMy wife drew the line here, she was hoping we would keep this between the two of us as a funny prank. But how can I expect her family to see what jerks they\u2019ve been if I don\u2019t expose it? FWIW Steve was fine.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33344"}

The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down.

It's happening a week from now and because I haven't seen everyone in so long I decided to come down two weeks earlier to help out and catch up. Well, when I came to see my family my sister freaked out upon seeing me. As it turns out she has gained a bit of weight not super noticeable to me she still looks great.

She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just \"harmless teasing\".\n\n\nMy husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.\n\n\n\nWe went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just \"kids teasing each other\" and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 33167"}

My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. \n\nIt hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me \u201ckilling\u201d her and he can\u2019t stand to look at my face. \n\nYou can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That\u2019s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. \n\nMy aunt doesn\u2019t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that\u2019s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn\u2019t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It\u2019s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason about why we\u2019re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. \n\nBut he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of \u201clife stuff.\u201d It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. \n\nI told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma\u2019s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it\u2019s been put in jeopardy. \n\nMy dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn\u2019t agree at all with what he did and it could\u2019ve been avoided if I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nFor me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious.

For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. \n\nTen years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. \n\nSo here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. \n\nSo recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't.

Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It\u2019s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme \u201cgay rat wedding\u201d. To my friend\u2019s wedding. He and his fianc\u00e9 are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big \u201cI SUPPORT GAY RATS\u201d on the front. \nMy friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am \u201cthrowing water in her flame of creativity\u201d. \nThe wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nwell guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn\u2019t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon\n\n\n\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\n\nHello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So\u2026 the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to \u201cappreciate the gays\u201d. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! \nPs: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey\u2019s name, won\u2019t happen again lol\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32935"}

When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.\n\nWe didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.\n\nSo my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.\n\nI visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.\n\nI said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back \"like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?\"\n\nEveryone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.\n\nMy mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about.

I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M. \n\nI have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter \"the house will be yours\" nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to?\n\nOne important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist.\n\nMy fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split. \n\nI spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32845"}

So thanks to everyone who told me what I desperately needed to hear. \n\nI started gathering evidence which would allow me to leave relatively savely. After I had enough evidence I prepared to leave. I gathered all documents and secretly packed up some stuff for the kids and myself. I informed my parents and my brother about the situation. My parents immediately turned my brother's old room into the new kids room and my old room has never stopped being mine. I waited for my husband to be gone and then my brother picked us all up. \n\nI left a message for my husband explaining that I wasn't coming back and that I'd be filing for divorce. I also told him about all the evidence so he wouldn't do anything stupid. \n\nI've been at my parents' for nearly a week now. We have a carer who stays here 3 nights a week and I share the other 4 nights with both my parents. My dad is retired so he looks after the kids for a good portion of the day. \n\nI have talked to a lawyer and she said I will likely get full custody. \nMy soon to be ex has left some nasty messages but hasn't shown up so I feel relatively safe. I don't think he will fight for custody since he was always disappointed that our daughter wasn't a son and our son isn't the strong little boy that he wanted either. \n\nAs of now I will stay with my parents.

I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. \n\nMy sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn\u2019t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.\n\nYesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.\n\nI asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a \u201cstupid baby toy\u201d and that he saw people break them online. \n\nMy sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.\n\nShe laughed and said no. She says I shouldn\u2019t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. \n\nSeeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.\n\nMy sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn\u2019t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won\u2019t miss it. I than told them to leave.\n\nMy nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.\n\nOther family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don\u2019t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don\u2019t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.\n\nThey all think I should buy another new system for him but I don\u2019t have that kind of money.

He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it\u2019s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.\n\nMy whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. \nIn college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. \n\nDuring visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren\u2019t married we weren\u2019t allowed to share a bed. We didn\u2019t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.\n\nDuring Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.\n\nThe 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. \n\nThey snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband\u2019s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That\u2019s when I saw red. \n\nI started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn\u2019t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house \u2014 that was still in my parents\u2019 name.\n\nMy bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in \u201ctheir\u201d house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn\u2019t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.\n\nThe kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.\n\nI told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.\n\nI want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless?

Despite this, I was THE ONLY person, not only in the wedding party, but also at the ceremony, who wasn't allowed to have a +1. This was an outdoor wedding with unlimited seating and these people don't give a shit about COVID so it wasn't about that.   \n\n\nI was told it was because my relationship wasn't \"serious\" enough despite us being together for a year. That only engaged or married couples were invited. And that they didn't want \"some random guy\" in their wedding pictures who \"I might not even be with\" later in the future. They don't want to \"have to look at some random guy in their pictures\" even though he wouldn't have been in any of the posed pictures at all. Maybe just in the background of crowd shots.  \n\n\nThere have been NO conflicts between them and my boyfriend and he's a nice and mild-mannered guy who gets along with everyone so I don't think it was about him personally.   \n\n\nI get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.   \n\n\nThis is when I started feeling surly. I smiled and played my part during the ceremony but inside I was very surly and angry.   \n\n\nWe then got to the reception which had way more people than the ceremony. This is where all the \"more distant friends\" were invited. AND EVERYONE THERE had a +1. I was literally placed at a table as the one single person and everyone else at the table was a couple. Some at the table were other members of the wedding party, but others were random distant acquaintances. People started asking me where my boyfriend was and I said I was told he wasn't invited. They asked why and I said I had no idea why. This is when I started letting my surliness show and started acting rude and mean, because I was humiliated.   \n\n\nAND THEN, I was \"brought into conversation\" with the couple's male friend, Dean. I was previously told that Dean has a crush on me and I made it clear I wouldn't be interested even if I were single. Even after that he kept trying to message me and I ignored him. But now the people who \"brought me into conversation\" with Dean were like standing around staring at us and giggling behind their hands. Like they thought they were Cupid matchmakers. Dean was absolutely a participant in this  \n\n\nI was meaner to Dean than I've ever been to anyone in my entire life. I was as fully rude as I've ever wanted to be when being the target of someone's romantic interest unwantedly. It's true I don't really know if I was being set up but I was already furious before that happened. Everyone was silent and awkward.  \n\n\nI went back and finished my meal, and as soon as I was done, picked up my purse and left and went straight to my boyfriend's house, skipping most of the reception, cake cutting, speeches, and everything.   \n\n\nI'm now being told by the couple that they're \"hurt and confused\" why I left so early.

After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fianc\u00e9's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family).\n\nAnyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fianc\u00e9's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, \"It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once.\" and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset.\n\nIn response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the \"wedding colour\", to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable \u2013 and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.\n\nMy niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fianc\u00e9 to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy. \n\nAITA for trying to overrule her parents?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32685"}

Teaching her that it's ok to say \"No\" to things she feels uncomfortable with.\n\nThere is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.\n\nMy daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. \n\nHe said no because the teacher had said \"about\" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that \"you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules\" and she said she didn't care. \n\nI heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.\n\nBut then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. \n\nI sent her an email saying..\n\nDear Mrs. (Teacher)\n\nI'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. \n\nShe's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.\n\nI understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.\n\nI think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her \"No\" and stepping out of the situation.\n\nI hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the \"Include everyone\" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say \"No\" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. \n\nThank you,\n\nOP\n\nShe emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh\n\nAITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?\n\n////\n\nEdit to update...\n\nI reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. \n\nI ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. \n\nWe all presented a united front asking for the following...\n\nThe school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be \"nice\". Instead of \"Include everyone\" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. \n\nWe went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.\n\nThanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32659"}

I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. \n\nFast forward to a few days ago.

She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far \"exotic\" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.\n\nCathy then jokes about how all this \"no travel business\" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was \"at a native speaker level\" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.\n\nI was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy \"oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!\" (\"oh fun, we have something in common then!\")\n\nShe immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she \"couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it.\" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.\n\nShe got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added \"which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!\" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said \"whatever\" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.\n\nHowever, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting \"superior\" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a \"little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues\" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have \"witnesses\" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. \n\nEdit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an \"exotic\" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know \"exotic\" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. \n\nEdit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands.

I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they \"missed\" out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their \"traditional feasts\" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family.\n\nI understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese?\n\n\nEDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely.\n\nCome on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32477"}

A couple hours after I posted it, I realized I left a lot of information out and wanted to clarify some things, as well as provide an update on the situation.\n\nSome people asked if I pay rent or own the house. It's my parents house, and I don't pay rent. I can't afford to move out right now, and my parents don't want to let me move out until after my first year of uni. \n\nSome people also asked if I'm autistic. I have ADHD, which shares a lot of traits with autism. I stick to a strict routine because it's the only way I'm able to remember to do everything I need to in the morning. \n\nA lot of people suggested packing my lunch at a different time, or even the night before. I had tried this before; no matter what time I went into the kitchen, my mom followed. I tried it again a couple times since making the post, and she continued to follow me.\n\nI took the advice of some people who told me to try going into the kitchen as usual, but to leave when my mom got in my way and tell her I'd wait until she was finished. I even made sure the kitchen was spotless the night before. Dishwasher emptied, no dishes in the sink, counters wiped down, and trash emptied. She followed me in, and when I said I'd wait, she said she was done. Almost as soon as I went back in, she followed me in again and claimed she had forgotten to do something. \n\nA lot of people pointed out that she might just want to spend time with me, which I hadn't thought of before. I think that maybe me getting a job, finishing high school, and starting to work towards getting my driver's license made her realize I'm growing up and won't be dependent on her/living at home for much longer. Maybe she just wants to spend as much time with me as she can before I go, or maybe she doesn't feel as \"Mom\" as she did before. \n\nWhat finally worked was, after dinner a couple nights ago, asking her to pack some leftovers from dinner in a separate container for me to take for lunch the next day. She seemed really happy that I asked, and didn't follow me into the kitchen the next morning. She even left a sticky note with a smiley face on top of the container! I also asked if she could drive me to work, which gave us the chance to chat and catch up in the car. \n\nI think she just missed feeling like I need her, which I always will. Even though we butt heads sometimes, she'll always be my mom, and I think I just needed to find a way to remind her of that. \n\nI wrote my original post feeling super frustrated at my mom, but I teared up a bit finishing this update. Sending a massive thank you to all the kind people who commented and helped me work this out :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32462"}

Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a \"responsible adult\" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn\u2019t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.\n\nBri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.\n\nI don\u2019t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.\n\nlong story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn\u2019t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don\u2019t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn\u2019t go into detail about.\n\nIt's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.\n\nAITA??\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32389"}
{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: Peanut_Sauce_Fiasco \nMedia: text \nTitle: AITA for sending my coworker into anaphylactic shock? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.\n\n\nSo I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.\n\n\nLately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.\n\n\n\nThursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) \"borrowed\" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. \n\n\nBut he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?\n\n\n\n\nEdit: holy shitballs this blew up!\n\n\n\nI *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. \n\n\n\nMy coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?\n\n\n\nTo answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.\n\n\n\nI'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.\n\n\n\nSuing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.\n\n\nAnd for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: the recipe\n\n\n\n\n2 tbsp red curry paste \n3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 tsp dark soy sauce\n2 tbsp cider vinegar\n3/4 cup of water\n12 oz of coconut milk\n\n\nI cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo\n\n\n\nI had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new\n\n\nAnd the natural pb is important! Nuttier, stronger and far less sugar\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32381"}

Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.\n\nConnor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it\u2019d be fun to act like college students again.\n\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement \u201cNever Have I Ever cheated before\u201d came up.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fianc\u00e9 cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my \u201cboyfriend\u201d of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).\n\nWell my brother knows about this so when I didn\u2019t drink, he went \u201chey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex\u2019s name*). You have to drink to that!\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t any of it and ended things on the spot. I\u2019m numb. I\u2019m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on.\n\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn\u2019t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn\u2019t think when he said those words. I just can\u2019t look at him right now. He ruined my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt. Am I being unreasonable?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32379"}

I wasn't sure if I was going to make this update, but things are getting gloomier, and I feel that I owe you guys the closure you deserve, for all the help you gave me (as well as the multiple news stories lol). Although I didn't respond much, due to everything being so new and overwhelming, I want each of you to know that I read every single comment and message, multiple times, over the past year and a half.\n\nI did end up telling my wife, soon after my post. She took it rough, as expected. It ruined me to see her that way, but I knew that I needed to tell her. She did enjoy reading through the original thread though, as many of you had heartwarming thoughts and messages. We took the time that we needed to ensure that she would be setup as best as possible. Following that, we went and spent the best 4 months of my life in Australia. The experience was amazing, and I couldn't have asked for a better dying wish.\n\nWe came back just in time for COVID. Honestly, I was scared to death (and still am), but somehow I've lasted this long. I've lost much of my strength, and hospice has come in to setup the house and ensure that I am comfortable enough to die. I had thought that I would be dead by now, so it is hard to complain about getting a little extra time.\n\nI've left a large collection of greeting cards in possession with a friend-- birthday's, first anniversary without me, remarriage, children's birth and birthdays (if she uses my sperm). I didn't tell her about any of these, just because some of these events aren't guaranteed. But I know that they can help if the time comes around.\n\nOverall, I'm content (about as content as I can be). There's a lot of things I would have done differently in life if I had known this would happen, but that's unfortunately out of my control. However, I do know that I did the most I could have done with the remaining time I was given. I am just glad that I had time left while I still had my health, as I know that many aren't as lucky.\n\nThanks again for all of your help. I'll answer any questions you guys have, so long as it isn't personally identifiable (which includes my medical information, as my town paper was thoughtful enough to write an article about me). Just be patient please; even typing for long periods of time gets painful.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32379"}

I\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I\u2019m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. \n\nMy friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. \n\nSarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\u2019re a physical feature I\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \u2018cartoon boobs\u2019. I know she\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before. \n\nNow we\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\u2019re in a porno. We don\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\u2019t spoken again. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I\u2019m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah\u2019s been telling everyone that it\u2019s ME that\u2019s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I\u2019ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don\u2019t even understand the stupid \u2018boy body\u2019 insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she\u2019s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn\u2019t sure at first but fuck it, I\u2019m reporting her. I don\u2019t know why I ever considered her a friend, she\u2019s fucking mental and annoying.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn\u2019t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn\u2019t).\n\nI\u2019ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don\u2019t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I\u2019ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I\u2019m stupidly shy?)\n\nMy head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.\n\n\n**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I\u2019ve seen:\n\n- I\u2019ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I\u2019m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.\n\n- My breasts alone aren\u2019t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can\u2019t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won\u2019t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People\u2019s comments don\u2019t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.\n\n- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.\n\n- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.\n\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nThe coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. \n\nI have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It\u2019s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don\u2019t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I\u2019m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don\u2019t directly work with one another but it doesn\u2019t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn\u2019t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. \n\nI don\u2019t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don\u2019t ever have to interact with one another, I\u2019m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don\u2019t care.\n\n\n**Last Update:**\n\nI\u2019m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I\u2019ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don\u2019t need this misery in my life. If she\u2019s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. \n\nIf I don\u2019t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32364"}

My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. \n\nAfter that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32351"}

I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled \"I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???\" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was \"royalty\" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I \"technically\" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened.

Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because \"oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone\". \n\nI stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. \n\nAnya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. \n\nFew months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. \n\nA week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. \n\nSince then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. \n\nLater that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. \n\nI was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the \"She is my daughter, not yours\" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. \n\nWhether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. \n\nOf course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. \n\nBoth of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32243"}

It has been a couple months since my last post and so much has happened. [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/m47ual/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_husband_for_using_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nI first want to thank EVERYONE who reached out and snapped me out of this daze with my SOON TO BE EX! He was extremely toxic and just made me feel not even worth anything. Thus probably why it was so hard to see he wasn't it. So I want to thank everyone who offered words of encouragement and even the tough love. I needed to hear it.\n\nAfter he went back to his parents he was waiting for my apology (which I never did) and when he noticed I drained our joint bank he escalated saying I was his and how I could never actually leave him and that he \"owned\" me, all of my success was his and without him I would a loser drop out. His family was even worse because I had already blocked them so they started making fake accounts and using apps to hide their number to harass me. Saying I ruined their sons life and how he sacrificed everything to get me where I am to throw him to the side like this was disgusting and I deserve to rot.\n\nI provided all this to my lawyer who recommended I take a restraining order (in case he wanted to escalate further) and to not engage EVER but just keep the records. This has caused my anxiety to go through the roof and I am working on this with my therapist. I have separated the finances completely and changed my banks, even told them my stbx is NEVER allowed to access these accounts because he would take it all and run. I have changed my number and gone completely social media less(besides this). Part of me is broken that our marriage came to end over a computer. I keep thinking I am stupid and how I couldn't see the warning signs. I must look like a fool to everyone. All in all I'm slowly picking up the pieces of my life and figuring out how to move forward. Thank you to anyone still reading this and thank you everyone who helped me get here.\n\nSummary: I am officially filing for divorce after I never apologized to him which only made my soon to be ex-husband and his family started harassing me to the nth degree. I was having a panic attack everytime the phone rang so I had to change my number and delete any social media. I am gaining my freedom from my toxic partner and his family.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32233"}

I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.\n\n\n\nThe day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.\n\n\nBefore I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. \n\nThey didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.\n\n\nI went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of \"teaching me a lesson\" was not right.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32208"}

I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.\n\nAnyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they\u2019re cutting capacity by half. As a result she\u2019s sending out \u201cre-invites\u201d that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she\u2019s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word \u201cessays\u201d to two questions. The gist is that they\u2019ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people\u2019s enthusiasm. People who don\u2019t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.\n\nI just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren\u2019t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like \u201dwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us?\u201d And \u201cwhat will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?\u201d So she\u2019s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. \n\nAnyways I told her in advance I\u2019m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She\u2019s said that to keep things fair if I don\u2019t fill out the RSVP correctly I won\u2019t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. \n\nAITA if I stay stubborn on this? I\u2019m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 27F. I don\u2019t live with family but she is my only sister.\n\nEdit2: Sister has framed these essays as \u201csurveys\u201d but there\u2019s a word limit requirement so if you don\u2019t reach it on the google forms you can\u2019t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32172"}

Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only \"friend\" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\\*\\*\\*\\* and a c\\*\\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\\*\\*\\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.\n\nAITA for not wanting to forgive him??\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 32136"}

Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.\n\nAs soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.\n\nThis released an even bigger tirade and series of \"what the fuck is your problem\"-s.

My bad, I'll get up now\". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.\n\nI noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31882"}

There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to \"brunch\" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.\n\nOn Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying \"Hey, I'm staying out until x time\", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed.\n\nI am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed.\n\nThe next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again.

Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. \n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\".\n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their \u201csilly joke\u201c. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping.

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.\n\nMy brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.\nMy brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.\n\nThe kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.\nIvan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.\n\nMy kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.\n\nSara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d\n\nMy dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children.\n\nMy wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine.\n\nI left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.\n\nMy brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving.\n\nI haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly.\n\nETA INFO:\n\nI adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents \"step grandchildren\". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.\n\nEdit no.2:\n\n- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.\n- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.\n- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31854"}

Llamas spit in self-defense.\" But they kind of laughed my warning off.\n\nNow, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.\n\nThe llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a \"warning spit\" (just saliva) and they went \"eww\" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.\n\nFinally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.\n\nTo make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.\n\nAITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31808"}

So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. \n\nWhile it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.\n\nSo that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, \"what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?\" Without a thought I said, \"same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table\". \n\nLong story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end \"dogs aren't comparable to humans\". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31766"}

I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting.\n\nI have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house.\n\nLater in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se.\n\nSean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31769"}

She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like \"I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children\".  \n\n\nNow that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. \n\nWell, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a \"healthy marriage\". But its my daughter's happiness that matters.

My brother still lives with them. I find out he\u2019s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it\u2019s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. \n\nI know exactly the reason why and it\u2019s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who\u2019s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. \n\nSo I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like \u201cyou are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\u201d This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. \n\nAnyways when he asked me I basically said, \u201clisten the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.\u201d I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he\u2019s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can\u2019t control. \n\nNow I\u2019m in hot water for \u201cruining his confidence\u201d and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

Or cut all the roses off her bushes because they were too cheap to buy from the florist I guess.\n\nAnyway my dash cam of my car which I park in the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of them close up and as a way to help my mom not have her plants stolen I printed all their pictures out and made a poster that said \n\n\"Oh Hay there! Don't be a Daffy-dil and steal, or else you might end up doing hard Thyme! We hope Thistle be a lesson to Yew! \n\nAnd I put the pictures of everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a funny fake name : \"mr potato head\" \"dill-a-tante\" \"pothead\" \"prick\" 'Succ-er\" \" i peony in my pants\" \"frond-less\" 'dirt-bag' 'in-fertile\" and \"root boy\" \n\n. I thought it was funny and cutesy, like how can you be offended with dumb plant puns... My mom thought it was hilarious and wanted me to hang it up because she was sick of seeing stuff stolen \n\nBut I got a couple complains, one neighbor said I needed to take it down because I had a picture of his son a minor who did something dumb yes but was just trying to bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that is was disproportionate and rude to publicly shame him.\n\nI told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty.\n\nAnother guy came to the house and returned a cutting his wife apparently tookbto propogate thinking it would be no big deal... But yeah it damaged the plant because she cut like a quarter off. And he asked if we'd take down the sign because she was on the board of directors or something from the town and whatever.

They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. \n\nSo the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. Obviously there's no way I could have known this.\n\nI'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there.

I am thankful to each and everyone of you to give me such beautiful and encouraging messages. These kept me going, no joke.\u00a0\n\n\nTippy was found 2 miles away from our house, a day after I posted ads and posters on several platforms and websites. A kind lady living alone had found him near her street, starving and exhausted. She responded to my calls for help on Facebook and I am utterly thankful to her. We need more people like her in this world :')\u00a0\n\n\nMy son and Tippy are both ecstatic to be reunited, he takes care of him just like he did before, only now I have some time on my hands to help him as well. However, my son is still wary of his father and he'll likely remain so for a long time. Now he doesn't ask him for help at all.\u00a0\n\n\nAs for my husband, he now treats Tippy as if he doesn't exist. He went and bought a new xbox controller right after Tippy was brought back and now demands that I pay him for damaging his property. I am willing to pay because I realise my impulsive response was not the best decision and nor was it the best way to deal with my situation. My approach towards my husband's Xbox and my husband's approach towards Tippy were both horrible and irrational.\u00a0\n\n\nMany of you mentioned that my husband may have been neglecting our daughter. It's unfortunate that you were right.\u00a0\n\n\nI started to notice some tender area and red skin around my daughter's diaper area around 2 weeks ago. She was uncomfortable, irritable and put up a fuss every time I tried to change her diaper. Turns out she was suffering from a diaper rash.\u00a0\n\n\nDiaper rashes can occur for a variety of reasons, none of which were applying to my daughter. She wasn't on antibiotics, she had soft cotton clothes, her bowel movements were normal and we weren't using any new products on her. This left only one option. Her diapers weren't being changed frequently. I was away from home for 5 days. I asked my husband how many times he had changed her diapers.\u00a0\n\n\nA baby her age needs her diaper changed at least once every 3 hours. My husband outright said he was changing them every 7 hours or so for those 5 days because he didn't think that they needed to be changed as much as before because she was now 6 months old. He had raised a son with me before, it's a ridiculous excuse.\u00a0\n\n\nThe diaper rash is gone now, but now I am scared to ever leave my baby with him when I go to work. I will have to sit down and reconsider everything and have a long talk with him soon. It's inevitable. He still plays Xbox just like he used to play before.\n\n\nI will never forget how a bunch of strangers jumped to help me find our dog. Thank you, you lovely people. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Please check out my account for a beautiful and heartwarming message I just recieved :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31658"}

Most of my husbands family think I am being childish and \"need to let the past go\", as my SIL can't afford this but her behavior toward us in the past makes me feel this is warranted.\n\n2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. \n\n3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan.

And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.\n\nI M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.\n\nDespite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.\n\nI started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.\n\nHe never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. \n\nLast week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this \"opportunity\" away to someone else.\n\nI didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.\n\nIt's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31610"}

This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. \n\nI was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.\n\nAfter talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.\n\nHowever, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he \"really liked it\" and \"it would only be fair\", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \"fair\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\n\nThis obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say \"but I need a chair!\" or \"What am I supposed to do now\" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.\n\nHe's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh.

I mean\u2026 literally anyone who saw that profile that knows us would immediately assume that it\u2019s me considering she\u2019s basically going by my name. Our parents forced her to delete the profile and she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, claiming that I not only ruined her main source of income, but also betrayed her trust. However, I think that she betrayed my trust by going by my nickname. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31533"}

We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31526"}

I decided that I didn't want this hanging over my head in our marriage. So it was tough, but shortly afterwards one night I had a few glasses of wine and told him I had something I needed to talk about. I had considered seducing him, having sex and then telling him so I could at least do it one last time but decided that would be manipulative and dishonest. \n\nSo I sat down and told him: When I said I had \"a lot\" of sexual partners it was over a stint of about 4 months as an escort.\n\nHe was taken back a bit and said \"That's not something I'd expect.\" I figured no one would, I dress modestly, I'm pretty conservative with drinking and I volunteer with the kids programs at my church.\n\nI had tears in my eyes and asked him if his opinion of me had changed. He said \"Well what you did didn't stop you from being the woman I fell in love with so why should it?\" I started crying more...tears of joy. \n\nI begged him to let me know if he had any apprehensions or questions or if it'd come between us in any way. He said he might have questions about any cool or sexy stories sometime but for now no. He even made a quip about \"No wonder you blow my mind in having sex, you were a professional!\" Not really the type of joke I'd normally appreciate but in that time it was perfect. And we ended up going to the bedroom not too much later.\n\nSo now I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I know just how much my fiancee loves me and what he's willing to tolerate in me. It's wonderful! We're both in lockdown basically now, both working from home and I'm so thankful to be able to be with a wonderful and amazing man who I love so much and who loves me so much.\n\nThanks to everyone!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31449"}

I\u2019m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.\n\nI responded that my time at the school wasn\u2019t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked \u201cI\u2019m sensing that you\u2019re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?\u201d\n\nI said let\u2019s focus on the story, and she was like \u201cActually this could be a better story.\u201d\n\nSo I said y\u2019know what, sure. Whatever. I don\u2019t owe the school anything, I\u2019m not being paid, and even though it\u2019s been a long time and I\u2019ve grown from what happened, it\u2019s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I\u2019d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.\n\nI mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn\u2019t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me \u201cMoolly\u201d for the rest of the year and when I yelled \u201cMY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY\u201d* she had me suspended for a week.\n\nShe ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went \u201cviral\u201d but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.\n\nA few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the \u201cMoolly\u201d incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?\n\nFinally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I\u2019m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can\u2019t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven\u2019t changed.\n\nIt was a long time ago, yes. I don\u2019t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn\u2019t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth.

We\u2019ve been doing this since they were seven.\n\nI met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything. \n\nMy kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I\u2019m watching TV.\n\nMy son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf.

I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic.

I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.\n\nI have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.\n\nAt first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still\u00a0 a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect.\u00a0\n\nThe next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment.\u00a0\n\nWell, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.\u00a0 So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.\n\nAnyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away.\u00a0\n\nShe obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31399"}

She said she needed more time to prepare her emotional state and she's overworked with their child, but she'll let me know when I can have the apology.\n\n(\u0298\u8a00\u0298\u256c)\n\n\\*\n\nThank you everyone for giving me advices on how to proceed with this mess.\n\nAfter speaking with my pre-law friend, I decided to go the legal route. I reiterated my compromise with SIL and my brother, but he has fully taken her side. My parents warned me that I'd be disowned and I'd be dead to them if I'm willing to stoop so low.\n\nI hired a lawyer and given all the details on my side. My lawyer said she needs my unedited manuscript for the book and my SIL's published book along with the copy SIL sent to have it proofread and edited. Because the published book has different parts changed, my lawyer needs the unedited version which SIL should still have in the transaction she did with her editor and proofreader. We took the risk to ask SIL for the unedited copy she sent to her editor & proofreader despite the chance of having her feign \"I don't remember their names, I don't have their contacts anymore, I don't want to, etc.\" I told SIL that we will go through the route of having to use third-party notarization to ensure no foul play on either part (have 1 individual look at my unedited manuscript and the one she sent to her hired editor + proofreader).\n\nOnce I told her that, she must've realized I was not bluffing. SIL and my brother accepted the compromise (I take the pseudonym, the royalties: with evidence of sold copies). I stipulated that SIL must put a message out to her followers on her blog that she stole from me and not a single word in the book is hers. I thank the Redditors for suggesting that.\n\nShe is clearly pissed off and disgusted with me for doing this to my own family.\n\nI threatened her with further legal proceedings if she doesn't do it. No lawsuit happened, but I'm glad I got a professional option just in case. As words got back to my parents of what I did and how dare I got a lawyer to punish SIL because her blog followers will surely lose trust in her and future revenue.\n\nI told them and my parents that if they have anything to say, use my business email. I'm done with them. They treated an outsider (SIL one month into dating my brother) better than they ever did to me. I don't need that negativity dragging me down.\n\nI'm happier, more free with my opinions, and I don't have to feel the need to compete with everything SIL does just to get my parents to love me a little more than a daughter in name.\n\nI have my friends; they've always been more of a family unit to me than my biological ones. I knew I was going to lose something coming out of this, but I didn't expect I'd be okay with the disappointment and hurt.\n\nThank you, everyone.

My husband has this friend (F31) \u2018Mary\u2019. They\u2019ve known each other since they were in high school and she\u2019s considered \u2018one of the boys\u2019, if you may. That basically means she\u2019s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don\u2019t mind at all, I trust my husband. \n\n\nWell, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I\u2019m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband\u2019s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me \u2018are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?\u2019 to \u2018are you a gypsy? I bet you\u2019ve got some of that gypsy blood in you\u2019 (which is just blatantly racist)\n\n\nLast week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she\u2019s been understanding so it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll say something this time.\n\n\nIt was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary\u2019s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I\u2019m just a \u2018immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband\u2019s life\u2019 and I\u2019ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn\u2019t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. \n\nAITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I\u2019m way too sensitive about my heritage and I\u2019m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I\u2019m still not ok with her.\n\n\nEDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I\u2019m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We\u2019ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I\u2019ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.\n\n\nEDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: \n\n\n\nA lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband\u2019s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn\u2019t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they\u2019ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I\u2019m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she\u2019s focusing on her career, she\u2019s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. \n\n\n\n\nBut now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I\u2019m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won\u2019t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I\u2019m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Ave\u021bi grij\u0103 de voi!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31311"}

This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  \n\nUnfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  \n\nFirst day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  \n\nI talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. \n\nHe started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  \n\nSo I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  \n\nI don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.  \n\nHe has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31278"}

He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. \n\nMy brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n\nSince then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.\n\nI told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31245"}

We haven\u2019t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn\u2019t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would\u2019ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn\u2019t really expecting that. \n\nI asked him why. He said that he didn\u2019t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn\u2019t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn\u2019t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn\u2019t want anyone to see him with the pads because they\u2019d think he was a \u201ctr***y\u201d. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn\u2019t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe I might\u2019ve pushed it too far.\n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?\n\n*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I\u2019m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we\u2019ll see how it goes*\n\n**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn\u2019t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn\u2019t feel like he had to, and that I could\u2019ve \u201cheld it in\u201d and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can\u2019t \u201chold in\u201d menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could\u2019ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. \n\nI asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he\u2019d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn\u2019t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I\u2019d need help is if I was a \u201ccripple\u201d. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn\u2019t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. \n\nI can\u2019t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can\u2019t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month\u2019s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I\u2019m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I\u2019m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31208"}

I am a 30 year old white woman with thick curly brown hair (3c if you know what that means).  I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with.\n\nWhen i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice. \n\nWell onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31119"}

We wanted kids but because of my health problems this wasn't possible.\nWe decided to go with surrogacy, my friend nominated her sister ( Brittany 29) I agreed right away cause I know Brittany and the family.\nWe've set everything up. Discussed payment, short and long term plans, counseling and dr appointments. We explored IVF and chose a private clininc to get it done.\n\nIt started after Brittany took a pregnancy test. She only told my husband though she had both our numbers. she only sent my husband a pic of the test while he was at work and sent me nothing when I gave her my personal contact info but it was okay. Things got complicated when Brittany started having access to our credit cards for her own wants and claim they were the baby's needs. She excluded me from dr visits and scans and had only my husband go with her. Her excuse was my husband drives and has time since I work and \"unavailable\" most of the time. I felt isolated from this experience but said nothing knowing she's bearing a lot of burden so I had patience. My husband had no idea what was going on and if this was normal. This was new to us so we didn't know.\n\n\nShe's 7 months in and last week she had us visit to discuss things that I thought we'd previously agreed on but she said she changed her mind about and her mom was there too. I heard Brittany out and was shocked when she gave a list of how things should be from now on since she said \"there was lot of confusion\" in the past cause of me stressing her out by complaining.\nShe requested she gets say in things like baby name after I \"deleted\" the list of names she sent to my husband.\nShe wanted more access to my husband's credit cards/free time to get stuff done at her place. Also more time with the baby than agreed on.\nThen wrapped up by saying only my husband should be with her in the delivery room and used the hospital as excuse. I got up and firmly stated I don't agree on her new terms and that she had to stop acting like she was my husband's wife and this was their baby. My husband didn't speak til she started crying. He asked me to sit down but I said I had boundaries, reminded her what her role was and how she overstepped.\n\nHer mom went off and and said her daughter was being mistreated when she put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for us, to make us a family. She gave up a part of her life in those months to give us what we want and I was acting selfish and ungrateful. She had us leave then told my friend and it got more complicated. I was told to apologize for what i said. IATA\n\n\nEdit: yes, we agreed on paying for the surrogacy like I stated above. So no favors or anything.\n\nEdit: No, we did not have a legal contract because my friend said there was no need for us to do that and basically talked us out of it since we are considered family but we had an agreement including paying her.\n\nEdit: Question about whether Brittany had kids of her own. She was a single mom of a 4 year old who passed away from an accident. She had him at young age but she always seemed in good mental and physical health.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 31104"}

She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. \n\nAnyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny. \n\nMy brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn\u2019t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing. \n\nHe\u2019s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he\u2019s probably well intentioned. \n\nI want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven\u2019t asked my wife why she\u2019s recently starting wearing more makeup and I\u2019m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. \n\nShe\u2019s spending her money on stuff for her face and it\u2019s a creative hobby. I\u2019m not going to be the dick that ruins someone\u2019s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there\u2019s a sinister motive behind it.

Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.\n\nSo I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he \"mellowed out\" \n\nIt makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now. \n\nIt's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help. \n\nSo I took a different approach. I stopped calling him \"angry\", or calling what he was doing \"arguing\" or \"yelling\". I just swapped in the words \"emotional\" or \"throwing a tantrum\" or \"having a fit\"\n\nI was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes) \n\nSo I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people \"Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake\" \n\nOr when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him \"Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.\" \n\nOr when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say \"Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.\" \n\nI tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like \"Oh, another of Jay's fits\" or something.\n\nI got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face \"Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional\"\n\nAnd again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.\n\nAfter a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much. \n\nAnyway, he slipped once this week and I just said \"I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional\" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said \"dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me\" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) \n\nI feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby.

She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. \n\nShe said that \"you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect.\" \n\nI obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam.

My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a \"realization\" moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids.

They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.\n\nI felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.\n\nAnyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.\n\nI guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad \"nagging her\". When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30992"}

We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.\n\nWife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the \"how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?\" card and I said \"Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?\" and she just up and screamed. \n\nThis has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. \n\nThe car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice.

My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her \"house\" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.\n\n\nI made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.\n\n\nI sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as \"punishment\" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out.

I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.\n\nMy daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.\n\nSome of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.\n\nIt was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.\n\nSo while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a \"morbid\" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30761"}

It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it\u2019s their only daughter\u2019s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest \u2014 his family did not contribute (which is fine!). \n\nThe wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn\u2019t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he \u201cproposed\u201d (something I didn\u2019t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. \n\nVery few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren\u2019t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn\u2019t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I\u2019ll call her Carol) and I aren\u2019t close. She\u2019s fine enough in low doses, but...\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must\u2019ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. \n\nCarol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a \u201cgift grab\u201d (our wedding website stated that someone\u2019s presence was gift enough\u2014 we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband\u2019s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back\u2014something we are fine with giving her. \n\nFor me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end.

She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.\n\nProblem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to \"lend\" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me \"your sister needs $X.XX for the kids\" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)\n\nSo over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. \n\nLater she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies \"God will provide like he has so far,\" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. \n\nIt's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30740"}

She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight.\n\nI have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma.\n\nMy wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating.\n\nI got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.\nI was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem.\n\nI went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing.\n\nI told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.\nHis dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.\nIt's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused.\n\nEDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters.\n\nI've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go.\n\nEDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30692"}

During the phone call I asked them why there was monthly payments being sent to my parents. Turns out my parents were living beyond their means for a while because my mother quit her job to be a full time stay at home mom. My grandparents decided to help out by sending them money monthly to help with my parents mortgage and also to set aside some of that money for college savings for both my brother and I that was to be split evenly. Turns out my parents only planned to put that savings towards my brother's college. And that's also how they bought his car as well. So from now on my parents are now on their own financially. Likely my mother will have to go back to work to help my dad keep up the mortgage.\n\nI confronted my parents and asked why they've always treated my brother as the favorite. Then asked if there was something I needed to know. Turns out there was...**NOTHING**! Literally nothing! I'm not an affair baby. Not even an unplanned pregnancy! They just liked my brother more! I was mad as hell and we argued a lot before I left the room because I'd had enough.\n\nMy grandparents showed up on Saturday with a moving truck. My parents were floored when we started bringing in boxes to pack. My father got in our way and I reminded him how he said that I should move out, so I am. My mother cried some more and said that my father was just angry in the moment when he said that, and they had been counting on my rent money to help with my brother's college fund. I asked if that meant he would never have had to pay rent like I did when he turns 18. My father then said that since I was taking a gap year to work, then my rent money could have helped my brother. Which means they never intended for him to get a job while going to college.\n\nMy grandpa was enraged and confronted my father, saying he raised him better than this. He chewed him out saying he's never been more disappointed in him, and they will no longer receive any more financial support. Then said he'd disown them both if they ever tried to retaliate against me for exposing them. My father backed down and neither he or my mother said another word to me. I had a bit of an awkward conversation with my brother as we said our goodbyes to each other. And that was it. I just got in my car, waved and drove off.\n\nI'm now fully moved into my new room at my grandparents' house. It's a little smaller, but nice. And my grandparents are very welcoming. I'm going to keep working hard to move forward from here and I appreciate everyone's support.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30676"}

He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.\n\nOur dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.\n\nWhen we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.\n\nA few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.\n\nI told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.\n\nWhen he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nI was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30645"}

This acc is just for privacy reasons\n\n-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. \n\n-I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23\n\n-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. \n\n-Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. \n\n-I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro\n\n-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. \n\n-Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. \n\nAITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30635"}

He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren\u2019t there\u2026 I was fucking slack jawed. \n\nI told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM \u201cyou just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.\u201d\n\nI was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read \u201cwelcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)\u201d and this is where things go down hill. \n\nI did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn\u2019t want to change her last name, and she\u2019s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She\u2019s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she\u2019s doubled down.\n\nWhen she saw the sign she joked \u201cMrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!\u201d Everyone went silent until his mom said \u201cWell the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!\u201d She takes the ring off and see\u2019s \u201cMrs.(his last name)\u201d engraved on the band.\n\nThen she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn\u2019t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said \u201cThis was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.\u201d\n\nSHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That\u2019s when I\u2019m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).\n\nShe was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said \u201cdoes he really think I\u2019m that shallow?\u201d She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. \n\nShe\u2019s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you\u2019ve all helped me realize, this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.\n\nEdit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn\u2019t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.\n\nEDIT 2 (update): I did not mention this plan when I originally posted just in case her ex found this thread, but I can report now that we got a heads up last night that he wasn\u2019t at their apartment, so we ran over and got most of her shit out, at least all the really important stuff. To those asking, no she isn\u2019t going back to him, it\u2019s over.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30623"}

I got my own room and stayed. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked.\n\nHer parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket.\n\nBut when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. \n\nOn the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?\n\nThe first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip \n\nAnd by \"they wanted to cook\" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo \"traditional\" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.\n\nSo it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9\n\nI screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.\n\nBut he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? \n\nMeg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.\n\nThe argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself \"the help\"\n\nHis dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.\n\nI left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  \n\nThen I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. \n\nI went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things. \n\nAITA for staying on that vacation and using the flight home? ,,,,\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30630"}

In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.\n\nMy parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.\n\nMy mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.\n\nThis year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying \"She is your sister\" and \"If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?\"\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30587"}

They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30557"}

I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.\n\nBut literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it.

It wasn\u2019t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d. I told her nah I\u2019mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.\n\nIt got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn\u2019t talk to me until we got home. \n\nShe say what I did was outta line and I don\u2019t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I\u2019m grounded until I do. Haven\u2019t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to \u201cinsult my grandmother\u201d ?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30539"}

I (31F) and my husband tried for 5 years to get pregnant. Testing eventually revealed I have eggs of fucking steel and without medical help I'll never get pregnant. So that's what we did. Gave our samples, one petri dish and 9 months later I have 2 beautiful fraternal twin boys. Jack and Adam (fake).\n\nThing is Jake has a condition. Without going into detail, requires a shot once a week. Once he is older he can take pills. I went back to work and MIL offered to watch the babes (shes wonderful, I trust her 100%. They were 9months.. Now 16months) during this time she would give his injection as we had a schedule. 10am before snack and nap. Worked very well until a month ago when she gave the shot to the wrong kid. Now they may be fraternal but they look identical. I'll be honest my husband and I even mix them up sometimes. Everyone does. She immediately noticed her mistake called 911 and they were transferred to hospital. By the time I got there Adam had been given the reversal agent and they were both happily sipping on juice loving the attention. We went home the same night told to push fluids. He was never in danger. Its a very slow acting medication that, at worst, would have given him diarrhea in a few days. MIL was beside herself. I tried to ease her worry but she refused to babysit so to daycare they went. \n\nThis daycare has a nurse cause some of the kids have medications so she new what to do but the worry of mixing up the kids was a valid concern (and they would NOT keep name tags on) Doctor recommended a medical tattoo. Explained they tattoo a freckle, no bigger then the end of a pencil eraser, on an area of skin that's easily seen while the child is under mild sedation similar to dental offices. Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. \n\nHe has a 2mm brown freckle on his earlobe.  From entering the office to leaving it took 30 minutes. Never felt a thing.\n\nMIL lost her shit the second I mentioned a medical tattoo. I tried to explain but she just freaked out so I put both kids on the floor and told her to pick up Jack and find the tattoo. She picked up Adam So I handed her Jack and after 20 minutes still couldn't find it. Stripped him to his skivvies. I finally pointed it out and she went \"That's just a freckle\"  I just said... \"My point exactly. Adam doesn't have a freckle there.. So that's how daycare can tell them apart\"\n\nShe's still pissed and ranting. Once I explain to others and they fail to find it they understand but they still think I went to far in tattooing my child and altering their body. I believe I took the necessary precautions recommended by the doctor and the tattoo will fade with sun exposure and as he grows. By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So.. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30496"}

Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. \nHe wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.\n\nMy ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).\nSince my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. \n\nMy girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn\u2019t want to take her favorite shirt over there.\n\nI immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be doing this good.\n\nI was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.\nTo a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.\nWe had a \u201cgirls\u201d tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. \n\nThe following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn\u2019t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.\n\nThey were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can\u2019t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn\u2019t want them to wear it. \nHe called me an A for being petty.\nAITA?\nEdited to add. \nThank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.\n1) AP stands for Affair partner \n2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.\n3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don\u2019t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories.

We're getting married soon, I've only met her family a couple of times. My daughter \"Judy\" F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time.\n\nJudy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.\n\n\nWe got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to \"photoshop\" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said \"yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now\".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.\n\nObviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even \"saying goodbye\", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30481"}

I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying \"shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?\" then walked out.

I just bought a house and my wife is expecting out son in November, so I let him know I was limited in what I could contribute financially, but did tell him I would try my best.  So, I wend to the bachelor party in Maine, I rented the tux, and paid for mine and my wife's dinner at the rehearsal dinner.  I also had a gift of $300 that I was going to give them, but we will get to why I didn't give it to them.\n\nHis (now wife, then fiance) texted me multiple times a day with updates--fine.  I didn't always respond and it got to the point where if I didn't repsond at LEAST once a day, I'd get a call from my buddy.  (I have a full time job and am redoing some rooms in my house, so I'm busy.)  She texted me for the following reasons:\n\n1.  My wife was NOT allowed to talk about our pregnancy, at all.  She didn't want anyone to focus on that more than her, the bride.\n2. She was NOT going to order special food for my wife (no one asked her to, my wife was fine with whatever she was going to be served.)\n3. I was not helping the groom enough, he had to help her with favors, seating charts and programs, so I had to help him with those things, according to her.  She also said to get ready to help with thank you notes after the wedding.\n4. She said if I was a true best man, I would offer to pay for the bar bill.  I don't even know what that means.\n5. She had to read a approve my speech before the rehearsal dinner and wanted to be include as much, as my buddy.  She told me to make up things if I had to.  I was also NOT allowed to include anyone but the two of them and no inside jokes or stories about my buddy that didn't include her.\n6. Her last text said to tell my wife to keep it together and not make a pregnancy scene during the wedding. Also, she wanted her to choose a dress that downplayed her pregnancy as much as possible.\n\nI was just so aggravated, I spoke to my friend to see if he could reason with her.  He told me to just play ball on this one, it's her day and to cut him a break, because he'd be dealing with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I was annoyed but calmed down.\n\nThe day of, all the bride and my buddy do is scold me, berate me and bark orders.  I head down to the bar for the a drink...the bride's mother is there and warns me not to get drunk because I've ruined her daughter's day enough.  Final straw.\n\nI didn't give them the card with the cash and in the speech, I used my friend's exact wording about having to deal with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I wished them the best and told him I'd always be there for him, especially during the divorce.  AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30391"}

I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter\u2019s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. \n\nA couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. \n\nSo after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. \n\nI sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. \n\nI encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.\n\nShe got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.\n\nSo class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is *Keeley\u2019s* Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d \n\nA few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. \n\nThe long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d\n\nThat surprised me. I couldn\u2019t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.\n\nAll of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .\n\nIn the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.\n\nFast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.\n\nSo my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.\n\nMy mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.\n\nMy friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?\n\nEdit: Answers to some questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ic651e/wibta_if_i_send_my_parents_to_jail/g231dny/)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30322"}

It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.\n\nWell this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.\n\nI (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.\n\nWell it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for \"being cruel to my brother\" and \"abandoning family when they need help\". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I \"understood the right thing to do\" before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other.\n\nSo I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA?\n\n\\-\n\nSorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer.\n\nLots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful.\n\n1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.\n2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.\n3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.\n4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.\n5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious).\n\n\\- Edit 2 -\n\nTo everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst. \n\nAccording to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him.\n\nAlso its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30242"}

We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas.\n\nEvery Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a \"kid of Christmas\". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left \"Santa Claus\" footsteps, ate a carrot and \"grass\" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that.\n\nMy husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it.\n\nWe bought the cute Elf. My kids named it \"Bob\". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it \"fly\" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him.\n\nBut my husband took seriously the \"Behave or Bob would be naughty\" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed.\n\nFast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me \"no idea\". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. \"Bob\" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents.\n\nMy blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the \"magic\" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.\n\nEdit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common.\n\n1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent.\n\n2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from \"Bob\". Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him.\n\n3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too.\n\n4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be \"attacked\" by Bob.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30191"}

I don\u2019t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I\u2019m at university. I do however pay my parents about \u00a3300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I\u2019m in my final year of uni so I\u2019ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. \n\nI also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it\u2019s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to \u00a3100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to \u00a380 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I\u2019ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.\n\nThe only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was \u201cfree money.\u201d I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can\u2019t Magic up that kind of money. \n\nThings went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.\n\nWhen I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they\u2019re all trying to take me for a ride and they\u2019re trying to manipulate me cos I\u2019m young and they think I\u2019m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn\u2019t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It\u2019s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument.

I have read all of your comments, and thank you once again. I am in tears and became an emotional mess after reading your thoughtful responses, thank you for the love and support. I have always felt as some sort of emotional burden to my friends, so thank you for your encouraging messages and telling me to keep my head up high. Even though we are all strangers on the internet, it sort of felt like I had gained new family. My heart goes out to the people who have messaged me privately of their experiences with losing their loved ones to drunk driving as well. Please know, I have felt your pain, you are not alone in this and I wish you all the love in this world.\n\nNow for the update, I did what some of you suggested and called my other friends to let them know what Amy had asked of me. They were quite livid and angry for me as they had no idea what Amy was planning for the wedding, we arranged a zoom call with her the next day to discuss why is she being so insensitive to me. Well, the call was quite the battle. It started off calm, then Amy just blew up. You guys were right when you said that Amy was jealous of the attention that I had received during the time of my family\u2019s death anniversary, her wedding was a way to shift the attention towards her. She tried to explain to us by having the wedding on that day, it will turn a negative situation into a positive one. When she realized she wasn\u2019t convincing enough, it felt as though a mask had fallen from her face and she started yelling and insulting me. She said that she is tired of having to play the supportive friend role and that it\u2019s been 7 years, I should just get over it by now or go join my family in the ground. My friends lost their anger and called her every name in the book. I am honestly just shocked and disappointed at the person who used to be my friend. It breaks my heart knowing I lost another person in my life, but I guess you guys are right in the sense that she never really was a friend. I now look back at our friendship and realized it was often one sided on my part. I wish it didn\u2019t take me so long to realize it. No one in our friend group of 6 people are going to her wedding now. We have decided to go no contact with Amy and block her on all social media. My friends have offered to go visit my family\u2019s graves together with me, I accepted and we are now planning to also make a scrapbook with my family's pictures. For once I am actually looking forward to this day, and will start to plan more eventful activities like this.\n\nThank you once again to everyone for helping me through this. And please remember, do not drink and drive, I am begging you, please don't. Please drink responsibly and drive safely everyone.\n\nEdit: I was once again not expecting this amount of attention. I am in literal tears, thank you everyone for your kind words and sympathy. I appreciate your love and support. I don't think I deserve the awards you all have given me, thank you kind strangers. Some are asking about Amy's fianc\u00e9 and his thoughts, we haven't heard anything as we still haven't even met him. We tried several times to meet him last year, but something always came up. I guess we'll never know his true feelings.\n\nEdit: I am so sorry for not being able to reply to everyone, thank you for your kind words and support\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30176"}
{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: tinanottiana \nMedia: text \nTitle: WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\n\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\n\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\n\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\n\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\n\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\n\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\n\nEDIT #2:\n\nNo, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \"Tiara\"\n\nNo, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\n\nNo, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\n\nYes, I correct them every time.\n\nNo, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!\n\nResponding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30169"}

My husband sometimes calls Carl his \"nicotine\" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. \n\nWe planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.\n\nMy husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull \"Carl is a widower\" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.\n\nThey got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30133"}

Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.\n\nSome friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.\n\nI was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. \n\nI have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.\n\nAITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?\n\nEdit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.\n\nEdit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.\n\nResources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia \n\nFor groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. \n\nYou get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say \"Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard\". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. \n\nMedication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30135"}

Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. \nA few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. \nYesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. \nBefore we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said \"besides, he's right, kids need a mom\". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said \"see, it's even turning you into a pu**y\". \nMy in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said \"listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person\". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. \nShe is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. \nAita for throwing her out?\n\nUPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. \nI want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. \nMy nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons.

A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL\u2019s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy.\n\nFor clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30082"}

I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months.\n\n\nLast week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish.\n\n\nSo AITA for this?\n\n\n\n[Edit - Q&As... ]\n\n(1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse. \n\n(2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too.\n\n(3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer.\n\n(4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs.\n\n\nOne more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol.\n\nAlso, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 30013"}

Appreciate the reassurance and understanding my decision when seems that many in this situation didn\u2019t. I remained firm in my decision about not letting them use my property for their wedding. Even if they changed their mind about inviting us which honestly I don\u2019t care about anymore. \nRick\u2019s family (thanks to him) got a hold of my cell so that was more people I had to deal with. I put my foot down with Rick a few days ago and told him directly that I will go to the police and press charges for harassment (I have all the texts and calls documented). Also had a very long talk with Carla about everything going on. She apologized for it all. And she knows it\u2019s her own fault. \n\nWell she decided to be the one to call things off in the end. Some of my friends still seem to think it\u2019s my fault and I\u2019m taking some distance from them for a while. And also from Carla after getting some confirmation on a few things that I needed to know. Whole thing is a mess. I\u2019m only glad in the end that I didn\u2019t give in to their demands and the constant bugging has stopped.. It still was a huge headache over the last few days and not the kind of drama I want back in my life. Thank you to everyone who made me feel supported in this. It helped a lot not feeling like the only other person (aside from my wife), who thought their demand was insane and inappropriate.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29996"}

I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even. \n\n\nShe also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other.\n\n\nHonestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??\n\n\nI have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.\n\n\nOne afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. \n\n\nI received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.\n\n\nI went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. \n\n\nShe was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.\n\n\nOur parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29949"}

Original here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/logumz/aita\\_for\\_accidentally\\_calling\\_out\\_a\\_new\\_colleague/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/logumz/aita_for_accidentally_calling_out_a_new_colleague/)\n\nMany people gave the advice to go to HR, others said NOT to go to HR because that would be escalating the situation. I decided not to go to HR right then, but I did take the advice to write down what happened, with the time and the names of the other colleagues present just in case. I thought the situation might blow over, because Cathy was probably just embarrassed.\n\nWell, I was wrong. Cathy kept being cold to me, rolling her eyes at me in meetings and talking behind my back. Another colleague came to confront me at one point to ask me why I'd been so mean. Apparently Cathy was telling a different version of what happened. Cathy said that I'd said mean things to her in Dutch and was making fun of her in Dutch, so no one else but her could understand. She was smart enough to only tell these stories to colleagues who weren't actually there for it. Word got around and it turned into a bigger issue, with a couple people actually questioning my character, mostly just colleagues that don't work very close to me.\n\nHR got wind of it after a while and I got called in close to a month after the incident. They had already met with Cathy and she'd told them the \"she cursed me out in Dutch and was very mean to me\" story. I told them the full story and everything that happened after. They asked me if there was anyone else present who could confirm this, so those colleagues came and told them that Cathy had lied about speaking a language, stormed out and then started calling me a b-word etc. to others. They thanked me for my time and I got on with work.\n\nNothing happened until a week later when I was informed that Cathy was asked to leave. Apparently Cathy had doubled down on the lies and told everyone I was the one lying and she did speak those languages, so my boss told her in that case she'd have no problem talking to one of our Canadian colleagues (who wasn't involved in the situation) in French in front of him, just to confirm. At this point Cathy admitted she had been lying. It turned out she didn't speak a word of French either, or Norwegian, which was the third language she was lying about. This was enough for them to let her go, because part of the reason they hired her was that they were so impressed by her speaking multiple languages and work experiences she'd had abroad. The work experiences were made up as well.\n\nI'm just happy it's over. I'm confident it wasn't really my fault it blew up now, if it wasn't me who caught her in a lie, someone else probably would have down the line. The few people who kind of believed her ended up coming to me and apologizing for questioning me about what happened, so that's all sorted\n\nEdit: some people asking why they didn't test her language skills in the hiring process: our jobs don't actually require us to speak Dutch, French or Norwegian. I think they probably just saw it as a \"plus\" or something that made her stand out from other candidates. \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29907"}

I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.\n\nI felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nUpdate: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can \"end the conflict\" but he wants me to :\n\n* hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.\n* Swear that I don't have any copies to \"use\" against his mom later.\n* Apologize to his mom.\n* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.\n\nI haven't responded yet.\n\nP.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29868"}

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.\n\nDad told me to bring my \"partner\" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.\n\nI notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say \"*we* will check if *we're* free\".\n\nDad replies that \"this is family only\"\n\nI reply, \"I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones\"\n\nDad says \"that's different. Are you coming?\"\n\nI say \"we'll catch the next one\".\n\nDad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.\n\nI felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.\n\nAITA?\n\nInfo: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology. Of me and my siblings, 3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs, 1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she's #5 and dad gives the same story about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn't know until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29855"}

We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there.\n\nSo I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn\u2019t speak again. \n\nFast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle. \n\nHe was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. \n\nMy ex had backed out of the abortion but didn\u2019t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn\u2019t know about that. Apparently I wasn\u2019t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn\u2019t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn\u2019t properly care for her. \n\nHe asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.\n\nKara messaged me and we\u2019ve been talking. I\u2019ve met her twice and it\u2019s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we\u2019re just barely getting to know each other\n\nSo far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.\n\nWe met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.\n\nI had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn\u2019t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.\n\nThat night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They\u2019re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. \n\nYes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.\n\nSo right now I feel like shit. I get \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d but in this case I don\u2019t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I\u2019m still learning this whole \u201cdad\u201d business so don\u2019t know if I dropped the ball here.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29840"}

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn\u2019t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son\u2019s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). \n\nSurprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister\u2019s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: \nMy ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn\u2019t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he\u2019s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fianc\u00e9 into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s best interest were my main priority. That\u2019s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. \n\nI asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn\u2019t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said \u201cI thought this was family only what\u2019s he doing here.\u201d Loud enough where he could\u2019ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. \n\nMy sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn\u2019t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn\u2019t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she\u2019s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn\u2019t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out. \n\nLike they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what\u2019s the point of us working it out if that\u2019s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I \u201cescalated\u201d the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her .

That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along.

This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going.

I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.\n\nThis woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.)

I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.\n\nSo, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment.

She was telling me how I was the only person she trusted, and she couldn\u2019t believe I would act that way. I tried to remind her how she and her friends were dog piling me, and she said it was just jokes, I didn\u2019t have to react that way. \n\nWe are obviously not speaking right now. Was what I did justifiable self defense? I know I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it without liquid courage.\n\nEdit:\n1. I did ask her to stop, i was trying to keep things friendly. \n2.

My husband of 7 years, Mark (32M), was there with me and up until one point, is was an amazing evening.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Anne wanted a picture with all of our siblings (there\u2019s five of us) and their respective partners so we started lining up.\n\nWhen Anne saw that my husband was standing next to me, she shook her head and said something about him \"ruining the aesthetic\".\nApparently, her plan was to put one man and one woman next to each other alternately. \n\nMy youngest sister (18F), who doesn\u2019t have a partner and was standing on the very side, offered to stand between the two of us, so we could be close and Anne\u2019s wish would still be respected.\n\nI thought that was a great solution, but Anne disagreed and told Mark to get out of the picture.\nHe\u2019s quite introverted and tries to avoid confrontation under all circumstances, so he simply complied and told me not to get angry, but it was obvious that he was hurt and disappointed by being left out.\n\nObviously, it didn\u2019t stop me from getting angry and I walked away with him. I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable.\n\nI congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn\u2019t feel like our presence was wanted.\n\nWe left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little.\n\nAnne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should\u2019ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day.\n\nEDIT: typos\n\nEDIT 2 because there was some confusion:\n\nMy husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29762"}

I have read every response and I appreciate all the input.\n\nI have been putting off talking to my mom until Sunday\u00a0a week ago when I finally found a good opportunity to talk to her. I told my mom that I love her, that I didn't intend to hurt her by inviting Julia, and that I feel terrible for hurting her. I also explained to her why I invited Julia - this time she seemed to listen - and reassured her that me inviting Julia doesn't mean we can't have our own spa day or that I chose Julia over her because she is still my mom and I'll always love her. Then I showed her the websites of some spa places I had looked up beforehand and offered to pay for part of the costs. I know some people advised me against it but I think it's a small but important gesture to show my mom how much she means to me. My mom seemed really excited to go to one of them with me and said I wouldn't have to pay a cent.\n\nThen came the hard part for me. I told my mom that I feel like she never supported me in my interests and it hurts me that she can't even be bothered to show up to my tennis matches. I also expressed my feelings that I always felt like she wished for a more 'girly' daughter and how this hurt me. At first, my mom got pretty defensive. She tried to deny it, but I was adamant and in the end, when she saw how important this was for me, she apologized and promised to improve.\n\nLater at dinner, my mom asked me if I would like to go to a nearby climbing park with her and my step-dad in the future. I instantly agreed and was so happy, because going to a climbing park isn't something my mom would normally suggest. I feel like it means she genuinely listened to me and tries to truly improve our relationship.\n\nIt has been a week now since I talked to my mom, and I'm in good spirits as I hope our relationship will improve. I'm also hopeful we find our own mother-daughter thing in the future.\u00a0Thanks again Reddit for your input.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29765"}

The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. \n\nI eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. \n\nImagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.\n\nHe then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.\n\nHe stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.\n\nWell it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA\n\nTldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.\n\nEdit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. \n\nOtherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. \n\nUpdate: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. \n\nPeople apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.\n\nI was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.\n\nSo not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29763"}

When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. \n\nOver the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. \n\nA few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. \n\nMy former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they\u2019d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They\u2019re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.\n\nLegally I\u2019m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. \n\nI\u2019ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn\u2019t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don\u2019t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn\u2019t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn\u2019t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.\n\nTl;dr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn\u2019t expect me to take it with me?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29737"}

I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.\n\nRecently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.\n\nMy sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.\n\nIt all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.\n\nI asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nShe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding.

My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially \"Alessia\", she's in the same \"infertility boat\" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.\n\n\nAlessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.\n\n\nThe very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend \"Carol\" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because \"she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an \"inside joke\" between \"desperate infertile women\". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.\n\n\nSome friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\nso reddit, AITA?\n\n\nHello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me and\nAlessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.\n\n\nOh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed.

I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.\n\nFor the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.\n\nIt's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.\n\nThis came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.\n\nI basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. \n\nI tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.\n\nAITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29690"}

This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.\n\nIn any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.\n\nI contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.\n\nAITA here?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29668"}

I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\n\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\n\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\n\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\n\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\n\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\n\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!\n\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!\n\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\n\nI'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29673"}

And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29673"}

Am I wrong for planning on doing it anyways? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nTo start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. \n\nI brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones \"supposed\" to carry on our name.\n\nI think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?\n\n*UPDATE* \n\nDid not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands\u2014I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I\u2019ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) \n\nAs for my fianc\u00e9\u2014 he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He\u2019s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.\n\nThank you for all the encouragement! My fianc\u00e9 and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29628"}

Probably because I made a new throwaway and received a lot of attention I messaged reddit and the issue was quickly resolved. So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are here\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nA lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called \"ma'am.\" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages \"dear\" or \"darling\" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his \"true form\" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(original post)\n\nI(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI changed the oil to my own car\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeels like I can't even exist while she is here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say \"be safe\" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29580"}

When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.\n\nWeeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.\n\nSince then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?\n\nJim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?\n\nUpdate 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.\n\n1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.\n2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.\n3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.\n4. Online he announced that I \"pushed out a dark skinned baby\" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.\n5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.\n6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a \"Welfare Princess,\" and how I was going to be just another \"baby mama.\"\n7. Just to clarify. Jim is \"white\" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.\n\nUpdate 2: Spelling Errors  \n\n\nUpdate 3:   \n\n\nMod denied separate post so it's here as an edit.\n\nThank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....\n\nFirst, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.\n\nI do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.\n\nThis was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29547"}

She said to my daughter \"you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?\" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.\n\nI told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.\n\nThe teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.\n\nMy husband says I overreacted.

Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said \"Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become.\" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.\n\nNow, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking \"how me and my dick knows about that\". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole \"women get looser\" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: \"Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.\"\n\nSo I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29535"}

(I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)\n\nHe also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. \n\nWhen I saw them, I was out with friends and was like \"What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem\". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... \n\nAnd I included dealing with this fucker as a \"workday problem\" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. \n\nOn Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:\n\n \"Hi 'Coworker'\n\nI'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)\n\nPlease only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. \n\n- OP\"\n\nI didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. \n\nAnd he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? \n\nI screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying \"As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack.\" \n\nHe stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked \"Is this a work question?\" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? \n\nHe walked off... \n\nI feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.\n\nAITA for sending that email?\n\n---\n\nEdit... \n\nLooks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. \n\nI'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.\n\nEdit 2... \n\n I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. \n\nIt's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? \n\nI do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.\n\nEdit 3...\n\nHoly shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. \n\nShe just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. \n\nI asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.\n\nI haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.\n\nEdit 4...\n\nHe was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. \n\nI owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29507"}

That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. \n\nKim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. \n\nFor those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. But since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, I bought Jack a horse. My family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. \n\nJack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!\n\nThank you all for your comments and I wish everyone the best.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29437"}

Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.\n\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \u2018room\u2019 filled with something you\u2019re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. \n\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \n\nWhen I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\u2019t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\n\nI did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.\n\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\u2019t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\n\nI told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\n\nI\u2019m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29396"}

I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.\n\nMy husband's (m37) best friend \"Terry\" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically \"tell on me\" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.\n\nLike I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.\n\nHe went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.\n\nInstead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.\n\nEdit: autocorrect.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29385"}

Any questions can and will be answered in the comments. \n\nLong story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can\u2019t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.\n\nAcross from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven\u2019t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady\u2019s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. \n\nI. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she\u2019s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It\u2019s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them, but not saying anything to the neighbor?\n\nEdit: Typo, and further explained question\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29349"}

I don\u2019t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car.

We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal.

Maggie (14f), Levi (12m) and Charlie (10m). (**NOT THIER REAL NAMES)**Levi and Charlie share a bedroom\nand Maggie has her own room as the oldest and also only girl.\n\nMaggie is a great kid. She does her homework, helps with chores without too much complaint, doesn\u2019t bug her little brothers (too) much. The issue is that she will not stop slamming her bedroom door. When she gets up to use the bathroom at night she slams her bedroom door on her way out and back in. When she gets up in the morning or goes to bed at night she slams it. Pretty much any time she enters or exits her room the door gets slammed. And it\u2019s only her door, none of the other doors in the house. It shakes the walls and frequently wakes up everyone else in the house. Her brothers room shares a wall with hers and our bedroom is directly above theirs.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I\u2019ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling.\n\nI told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we\u2019re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won\u2019t talk to us now. My mother says I\u2019m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn\u2019t have to deal with the house shaking.\n\nI want to add that we completely respect each other\u2019s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn\u2019t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can\u2019t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don\u2019t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We\u2019ve told her we\u2019ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\n\n1) The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and light\n\n2) The curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on.\n\n3) The door isn\u2019t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29277"}

It's 1 point if you are late, 3 points to call off with notice, and 5 points for calling off within 4 hours of your shift. This is fine with me as I have no points this year and have only called off once since 2018. I'm the type who covers shifts, stays late and generally just go to do my job.\n\nLast week, I ended up calling off and was out for a week due to being hospitalized in the ICU with a horrible infection. I let my boss know at 2am that I was being sent out by helicopter and kept her informed of everything going on. Today was my first day back. I'm not 100% yet but like many places, we are short staffed. When I came in today, I opened and got to work. My boss came in 2 hours later and called me into her office. She informed me I was getting 8 points, losing my discounts and bonuses for 90 days, and was on probation. I was dumbfounded and told her I wasn't signing the papers as it was out of my control. She said if I didn't, I would be terminated. I told her not to bother and walked out. \n\nI'm now getting calls and texts from her and my coworkers saying they need me and I was an ass for quiting over something so small. My husband thinks I was in the right because it was ridiculous that I was getting punished for almost dying.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29266"}

I mentioned on the last post that I'd had some offers from competitors, and while most paid about the same, they required a step down in my career. A few of you pointed out that if I can earn the same money *after* a step down, something isn't matching up. I did some research and came to the conclusion that I am being overworked and underpaid. I also triple checked all my notes for the last 7 months of leave, and calculated that I had worked for 87 days out of just over 200. That was where I hit my limit.\n\nI then reached out to some of the people who had made offers previously, and asked if they could give me a formal offer. 3 of them did. My favourite has fewer hours/responsibilities and *more* money, and they're fine waiting on me to finish up my planned maternity leave (9 more weeks) before I start.\n\nI had a 'check in day' scheduled for later this month, but pulled it forward to Monday and asked my cousin and a few others to be there. I laid out all of the above. I was open to negotiating in a way that would let me stay in the company, but my cousin flew off the handle, and after that we agreed that me staying was no longer an option. As I have 9 weeks of leave left, I will hand in my notice, meaning I will not come back to work, but I will be paid for this time, as well as compensated for the leave I lost.\n\nMy cousin has blocked me on everything, but his mum has called my mum, who has been yelling at me for 2 days. I've had to block my own mother. My cousin is attempting to rally our entire family against me, but I have nan on my side, so he is not succeeding. I am **never** working with family again.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29256"}

He's been doing live streaming a lot lately even though I told him that we have responsibilities to take care of. Before our daughter (she's 7 months old) was born he'd stream randomly and spend lot of time with his \"followers\". Answering questions and engaging in conversations. He keeps saying that his followers are good for his mental health and that engaging with them weekly makes him become better at socializing and communicating.\n\n\nHe's been complaining about wanting to do a live stream for days. I told him we'd look at our schedule and see if we could get him some time to make it happen. Apparently, this wasn't good enough. Yesterday I had to go grocery shopping and asked him to keep an eye on our daughter while she was asleep. He said okay.\n\n\nI was gone for 4hrs but kept calling him to see if everything was OK. He'd tell me she was alright and that she was sleeping. I started getting this weird feeling something was wrong because, she must've had been hungry or needed a diaper change. He argued that everything was fine. I immediately went home and when I entered the house I didn't find him, I shouted his name but got nothing. I went into the bedroom and saw that my daughter was awake and her diaper wasn't changed...and worse was that her bottle was even touched. I was confused I got out and noticed that his office's door was closed. I figured he was doing a live streaming from the noise I heard. I was beyond seething I barged into the office and saw him sitting. I blew up while he was trying to turn his mic off and telling me to stop but I didnt stop. I berated him for leaving our daughter unattended and with no milk nor diaper change. He freaked out on me saying I just ended his entire channel and destroyed his fan base for interrupting his live stream and embarrassing and scandalized him like that. I told him to not say a word but he kept yelling calling me out of control and unhinged. He was almost crying so I had to leave the office.\n\n\nHe kept fighting with me til I decided to go stay with my mom. He started blaming me for ignoring his needs after he already expressed them and that he forgot to do what I asked him and I'd cost him so much. Now us telling to come back home because he misses his daughter.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29246"}

Will post an update when the situation is solved. \n\nEdit: please remove if not allowed mods. I\u2019m talking to my dads today and will ask them to got he principal with me  , the comments here made a little sacred about how wrong this could go and how bad was the situation. Will post an update if things can be posted online. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not in USA, even if this sound fake to you,  here in South America things are really this bad guys. \n\n\u2014-\nFor a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). \n\nI\u2019m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I\u2019m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I\u2019ll call Duncan (15m) found out. \n\nDuncan started simple with jokes like \u201cwow which one of them is the mom?\u201d Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient\u201d. \n\nDuncan started to escalate with \u201cEnjoy your time here, it\u2019ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell\u201d and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was \u201cYou can\u2019t be prejudiced with his religion, it\u2019s wrong in the Bible. He\u2019s is just trying to understand.\u201d\n\nIn my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn\u2019t go to another btw. \n\nI have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. \n\nSo when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mufasas\u2019 Death. The Fox and The Hound. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. \n\nThe scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. \n\nWhen we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy\u2019s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.\u201d He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. \n\nThen later Duncan\u2019s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I\u2019ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I\u2019ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m wrong, but with Mr.Smith\u2019s warning and Duncan\u2019s friends I\u2019m starting to doubt , so AITA?\n\nFINAL EDIT AND UPDATE\n\n\nMods told me to update here so the post is quite long, sorry!\n\nFirst I\u2019d like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to how bad the situation was and how it could get worse, and how I was hurting my dads by not letting them protect me like I want to protect them. \n\nNow to the update: Sunday I sat my dads down and told them everything, I was crying a bit  in the end since while telling them I realized how heavy it felt to be carrying all this.\n\nSunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn\u2019t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. \n\nHe told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. \nHe thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. \n\nAdam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. \n\nTheir conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. \n\nMy dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. \n\nShe choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won\u2019t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. \n\nApparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. \n\nBut he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don\u2019t have the support we got this time.\n\nSo, nothing really extraordinary, it all went like many of you guys predicted: Duncan will keep being my classmate but at least Mr.Smith won\u2019t bully any more of us, he was the real asshole in the situation. \n\nAlso my Papa is awesome and a badass.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29223"}

His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.\n\nThe other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nI asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?\n\nETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29217"}

His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of \"you work too much\".

I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I'd be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. \n\nThing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chairs had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. \n\nI was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom watched with their eyes popping out of their heads like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. \n\nI had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way out. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront of her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn't his nor his mom's fault guests arrived \"before\" me and took all the available chairs. I told him he could've saved me a chair!!!!!. he said that I could've just left instead, and reminded me that I was a \"guest\" and that I shouldn't expect this level of entitlement to be \"accepted\". He then went on about how I ruined the entire dinner for him and his mom with what I did and has been pouting about it for days now.\n\n\nI don't get it, I really don't. was my expectation really that entitled? I mean as his wife he should've saved me a seat. But clearly I'm missing something here.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29169"}

After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. \n\nSince all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\nI'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me.

So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more.

She is my only sister's only child.\n\n2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.\n\nMy MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).\n\nI didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.\n\nLast week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.\n\nWhile I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said \"I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts\". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).\n\nThe next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). \n\nWe did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.\n\nPeople in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29134"}

I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.\n\nThey said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.\n\nAnyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open\n\nMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. \n\nRight now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.\n\nSo I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\n\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\n\nAITA for what I did?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29105"}

I just want honest feedback.\n\nMy wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we've been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. \n\nAnd it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm \"useless\". \n\nThis all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.\n\nShe got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?\n\nEdit: my wife does get breaks, guys. I set up the annoying foot bath thing every night while she does dishes and then she relaxes with it while watching YouTube every night while I put the kids to bed. She also won't eat my cooking because she grew up in southeast Asia and doesn't like American food. It's not my fault she's picky.\n\n\nEdit 2: it's a Korean BBQ meatloaf she makes since some people pointed out meatloaf is typically American. Anyway, my wife found this post and now she wants us to do couples counseling. Thanks for the feedback, guys.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29079"}

(My dad and brothers cuss like sailors but apparently me cussing is unladylike?) \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.\n\nMy dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.\n\nThis wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.\n\nI thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.\n\n---\n\nI said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.\n\nBut it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. \n\nI suggested we make a \"Swear Tax\" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...\n\n----\n\nSo my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.\n\nI know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. \n\nIn the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.\n\nMy dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??\n\nI feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to \"want the family to learn not to cuss\" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.\n\nAITA for having the idea for the \"family swear tax\" after my dad got angry at me for swearing? I did it because I know I swear the least out of my family but I was the only one getting in trouble for it\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 29061"}

His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn\u2019t know was coming).\n\nShe seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it\u2019s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.\n\nI looked at her in disbelief, I couldn\u2019t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?\n\nAnyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she\u2019s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.\n\nJake didn\u2019t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through.

However, he had a lot to say about Lisa. He was complaining about how pregnancy \u201cruined\u201d Lisa\u2019s body and how a baby ruined his life. Amy and I kept looking at each other awkwardly and we were soon going to leave him be. \n\nWe didn\u2019t leave the conversation soon enough.\n\nHe was complaining to be about his sex life, or lack thereof,  and commenting on how desperately he wanted to have sex with someone \u201cfit like Amy.\u201d \n\nThis made the both of us extremely uncomfortable. Amy left, quickly apologising to Lisa. I told him that he was a \u201cdisgusting, gross man who needs some fucking help,\u201d before I left. \n\nApparently, this made him super upset and he started wailing at the party.

For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nAbout six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \n\nSo the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nMy potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\n\nETA: some questions people keep asking: \n1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and \"just do\". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. \n2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) \n3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.\n4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28888"}

I'm sorry if I didn't get to your message, there were so many of them so I thought i'd make a post instead. I got a little overwhelmed (:\n\n**TL;DR:** You guys were right, I am NTA. I used your advice and moved out (after confronting Nate about his behaviour)\n\nAfter reading what everyone wrote I quickly realised that what Nate did was so so wrong. A lot of great moms in the comments also helped me understand the fact that even conservative moms (like Nate's) wouldn't react so rudely. It hit me like a wave when I realised what my life had come to. I didn't say anything to Nate about the post but he must have figured out that I was upset at him. I was doubting our relationship and pulling away from him. He started talking to me again and for a day I didn't really say anything. But I knew I had some decisions to make. I genuinely didn't believe I would get so many responses telling me I was NTA so this was eye opening for me.\n\nSo a few days after I made the post I told Nate that we needed to talk. I said that I would be staying with my friend until I felt comfortable around him. He didn't know what I was referring to (which just made me angry because how can he forget a fight that big) and I told him I was upset with how he treated me after the whole \"your family walking in on me\" incident. I also mentioned how I shouldn't have to wait for him to be away to dance, bake or listen to one direction just because he doesn't like it. He tried convincing me to stay but I left. I think he knew I wouldn't let this go like the other things (thanks to you guys)\n\nYesterday I asked him to meet me at a cafe so we could have a conversation about everything that happened. Nate cried. Like for the first time ever since I have known him. He apologised, told me he messed up, and that he would change because he realised his mistakes now. I told him I wanted to move out and maybe after a while, if he does actually change, i'd give us another chance. I just needed some space to think about things and so I told him we should take a break from each other for a while. Nate told me he would talk to his mom as well and that he should have defended me to which I said yes you should have. I actually borrowed direct sentences (to explain why he in the wrong) from some comments you guys left because it was so helpful. It went better than how I imagined it would go.\n\nAlso, thank you. Thank you doesn't even begin to cover what I really want to say to everyone who helped me and also to the mods who removed a lot of creepy comments. Thanks for sharing your stories about dancing in your underwear as well! It made me feel better to know I wasn't some freak for enjoying those things. I'm going to use those baking tips you guys gave to me and make cupcakes right now actually because I can. I feel so relieved. <3\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28846"}

He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nIn November I\u2019m getting married. I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don\u2019t want to be reminded of what could\u2019ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we\u2019re incredibly close. \n\nShe naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA?\n\nUpdate - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn\u2019t okay. I\u2019m going to call my dad tomorrow\n\nUpdate 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you\u2019re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you\u2019re just as bad as I apparently am if you\u2019re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet\n\nUPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I\u2019d give you all an update. My boyfriend and I have decided to part ways and ive apologised to my dad\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28803"}

In that post it was determined that I was the asshole. \n\nA LOT has happened since then, so I decided to make an update.\n\nAfter reading your comments, I decided that I probably took it to far and although I was embarassed and felt violated, at the end of the day, it is her body and not mine. Just because we look the same does not mean I get to have a say, nor should it affect our relationship.\n\nSo, I called her and told her I wanted to talk and we had a really long emotional discussion and I obviously decided to not kick her out as long as she was able to cover her rent going forward.\n\nThen, Covid happened. And as of June, I no longer have a job. I was one of the newest people at the company I was working for and so I was one of the first to go.\n\nAnd in a turn of events, my sister who has been killing it on onlyfans, is now covering for my portion of the rent until I am able to get back on my feet.\n\nSo, thank you for your advice. I might have ruined my relationship with my sister and maybe even be homeless without it.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28791"}

She's been more defiant than usual.  I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because \"she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28788"}

Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.\n\nI had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to \"take my power back\" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.\n\nThe problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of \" you can change the worst memories\" or some shit like that.\n\nMy sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of \"oh well if you are not using it i will\". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.\n\nNow my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to \"take my power back\"\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking me\n\nEdit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party? Do you know how relationships work. Are you also going to tell me that if he cheated on a Saturday it wouldn't count? Or if he left the country? This is hilarious coming from a sub that says cheaters are the worst people In this world.

We both work on the ups of 50 hours a week. I am shift manager at a behavioral disorders facility. Both jobs are very hands on and strenuous. \n\nSince his promotion he has developed an entirely different attitude. Extremely entitled and dare I say rude as all fuck. He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. \n\nSo, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after \"working so hard\". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say \"wheres mine?\" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say \"I worked all day\" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he \"makes more\". \n\nLast night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says \"babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!\" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said \"Did you hear me?\" \n\nSo I responded with \"Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself.\" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said \"But I worked all fucking day!\" So I snapped back with \"Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself.\" \n\nHe is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. \n\nAITA?

At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.\n\nUnfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.\n\nSo first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.\n\nWell that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.\n\nWe agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.\n\nI have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it.

As a last resort, I told her if that happened again, the phone would become mine and she\u2019d get an old flip phone that was my husband\u2019s  with no internet until she could prove trust. \n\nThe school policies had changed this term from a phone would be confiscated until a parent could come get it to a phone would be kept for 2 weeks as a first offense, 3 for second, so on and so forth. I wasn\u2019t okay with this as I don\u2019t trust the school to not lose it (i know they\u2019ve lost/broken other students\u2019 phones) plus I don\u2019t want them having access to my daughter\u2019s private info.

And the floors creak when people move. \n\nI've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.\n\nAnd the sound of the girls in the apartments to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. \n\nI know when I play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. So I'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. \n\nSo... When my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. Which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and I said no. \n\nFor example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. He wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her TV. I said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. \n\nAt 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. I said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. \n\nAt 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. I offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.\n\nHe had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. \n\nI got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him \"you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! I don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... Hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!\" \n\n(The 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)\n\nHe got irritated and asked why I was bringing age into it, and I said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! And he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.\n\nHe got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when I'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with \"ok boomer\" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a \"rich person apartment\" he could pay for it. \n\nAITA for what I said to my boyfriend about my apartment?\n\nEdit - A lot of comments are asking if we could stay at his house\n\nIt's not possible for me to get to his house on my own because I don't have a car and the buses don't go that far into the suburbs. \n\n So that would mean him driving 30 minutes from his house in the suburbs to pick me up, then an extra 30 to drive me to his house. Then an hour round trip early in the morning to get me home in time for work. \n\nIt's a lot easier for him to visit me in the city.\n\nEdit 2 - a lot of people in the comments are saying Technically 35 is a milennial and not a boomer. I know that.\n\n I am using boomer as A JOKE or a figure of speech to say \"acting out of touch and entitled to tell other people what to do\". It is a common figure of speech to say \"ok boomer\" to someone who is acting entitled regardless of their actual age... It's more of a mindset thing.\n\nEdit 3 - I googled his property records for his house and HE CO OWNS IT WITH A WOMAN WHO SHARES HIS LAST NAME! holy shit... I don't know if she's his wife or ex wife or what but I'm OUT OF HERE. I'm honestly freaking out right now but I just gotta say .. great big thank you to everyone who noticed red flags and made me question that.

They don't know he's unemployed because he thought they'll see him as a failure especially his mom so he told me to keep it a secret.\n\n\nLast night we were sitting eating dinner at the table. His cousin was talking about his fiancee going to brazil to do a boob job. Jared asked if he was serious then \"flattered\" FSIL's boobs saying they're perfect and that he didn't understand why she'd get a boob job. He then turned to me, stared at my chest while I was eating like an idiot (I have a flat chest, I'm insecure about it but can't do anything about it obviously) and said \"Hey why don't YOU get a boob job, you're the one who needs it the most\". His mom gasped and was like \" JARED!?? \" I said \"It's fine!\"\u00a0 I then turned to him and said \"I'll get a boob job once YOU get an ACTUAL JOB since you've been unemployed for 6 months now$!!\", He stared at me in disbelief. his mom began questioning him about being unemployed and he denied denied denied then admitted it was true. It got awkward with his mom scolding him and others shaming him for it and for hiding it. He got so overwhelmed he went outside and stayed inside the car til I came.\n\nHe started yeling at me repeatedly \"you coudn't have held your effing tongue?!!\", And accused me of turning his family against him and having them jugge then shun him now he can't even step a foot in their house from shame and guilt. I argued that his comment about my chest was insulting, but he said he was giving me a piece of advice and that there is nothing wrong with him wanting me to look pretty and that he said what he said out of support and encouregemnt, but I what I did was the complete opposite and that it was intented to hurt him and I succeeded.\n\n\nHe dropped me off at home then went to stay with his buddies. I called him later thinking he calmed down but his friend said he didn't want to speak to me and I shoud give him space.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28669"}

I have no shame about what I did, and only quit when I got a better job offer. In the time I worked as a stripper, I intentionally lived as cheaply as possible (shitty little studio flat, living off ramen, wearing old clothes) because my coworkers all told me that they were able to buy their own places on their income, so long as they saved like crazy. Before I \"retired\", I managed to outright buy myself a 3 bedroom flat. I rented out the other rooms for a while but I got sick of having roommates, so now I have them up online for shorter stays, but not to rent.\n\nI met this guy about 18 months ago, and we've been together since. He knows about my employment history, and he said that he has no issue with it, though he did ask me to tell his family the white lie I occasionally use (on my CV and stuff), which is that I was a waitress (which I kind of was tbf).\n\nA month ago we found out that I'm 2 months pregnant. He says this is great news, and we should move in together. I assumed he'd be moving into my place because he rents his (far smaller 1 bedroom) flat while I own mine, and I have room for a baby's room while he doesn't. Also, I really don't want to leave my flat. It's my flat, I love it, I could see myself living here for the rest of my life, and I don't want to lose the security of owning a flat and have to go back to paying rent or a mortgage each month.\n\nHowever, he then said that he didn't want to move into my place, and said I should sell it and we buy a place together. I said that I like my place, it means a lot to me that I was able to buy it, and it represents years of working my arse off scrimping and saving. He then said that he understands all of that, but we should be living together by the time the baby comes and he didn't want to live in my flat. I asked him why not - it's a great flat, it's central to everything, it's spacious, it's got room for all his stuff, there's a daycare in the building (run/owned by another tenant) and a school 5 minute walk away, the list goes on - and he said that he didn't want to live in a flat that was bought with \"stripper money\".\n\nThat really pissed me off, and I told him no fucking way am I selling my flat and that he never had an issue with my \"stripper money\" paying for this flat before now. I said I wasn't giving up the security of owning a home for someone who tries to make me feel ashamed about something I don't feel ashamed of. He said that his point is if I sold the flat then we could get a new place with the money from the sale. I said \"wouldn't that still be stripper money?\" and he said \"that's different\", and I asked how. He then said he was going back to his place because \"I can't talk to you when you're in this state\".\n\nHe's gone back to his flat now and he's texted me saying I'm overreacting/irrational and I need to think of this realistically rather than emotionally. He says he wouldn't feel right raising a child in my flat knowing how I purchased it and selling/moving is the best idea of all of us, not to mention the fact he isn't on the deed because it's my place and it \"would never feel like our place\" because of this.\n\nI feel I might be the arse because I get why he might feel like it's just my place and I feel I'm being too rigid in a time we need to work together, plus I spoke to my sister and she sided with him so 2 out of 3 people think I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate on the off chance anyone sees this: I dumped him. There was a whole conversation and during the conversation he said he didn't want to be a parent if I wasn't willing to do everything he wanted, including sharing a house/deed (plus staying together). Also, at the start of the conversation I said what a few people suggested, which was that I'd be willing to sell and split the house with him, provided he paid 50%, and he got very very angry, very very quickly. He also said a few other things, so IDK how it's all going to pan out just yet, but it looks like I'm going to be a single mother.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28649"}

I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an \"aggressive breed\", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.\n\nIt's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being \"dangerous\".\n\nI'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28639"}

My husband [36] and I [30] have 3 kids [2, 4, 7] . I'm a sahm (full time) and I take care of the kids while my husband works (full time).\n\n\nMy sister's wedding was last week. We live hours away which is an issue for my husband. When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn't going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same. Since the wedding doesn't allow kids and my husband doesn't want to hire a babysitter after the one we had robbed us. We had gone back and forth on this. but I insisted on going since that's my only sister and I want to attend what might be a once in a lifetime event for her. He chuckled at my statemtment then we stopped talking about it.\n\n\nAs the wedding was appraoching, He brought it up and told me to miss it and stay with the kids. I suggested that since no babysitters were allowed then, I could get my friend to stay with the kids but he refused. I ignored him, spoke to my friend who agreed to watch the kids and booked a ticket to travel to my sister's town in time.\n\nMy husband found out and went on about how he had work, and that the most logical solution is that I stay home with the kids and let him make his living. I told him that I already took care of the kids and they'll stay with my friend. Honestly? I grew inpatient. The day of my flight I dropped the kids off at my friend's place then headed to the airport. I found out he had canceled my plane ticket. I was upset but still insisted on going so I went home and got into my car and drove 4hrs to get to the town.\n\n\nAt 5pm. My husband called and was freaking out on me asking where I was. I told him I made it to my sister's town and he blew up saying I wasn't supposed to go, even said he canceled my ticket to get me to stay. He demanded I return but I said not until the wedding was over. He called me horrible, neglectful mom then had his mom scold me and accuse me of abandoning my own kids. There was a huge argument ensued when I returned home and my husband kept on saying I was horrible to leave the kids and to ignore him like that and do what I wanted eventually. He's giving me silent treatment as of now and I can no longer take it. I felt guilty and did NOT enjoy the wedding AT ALL.\n\n\nWas I wrong for still going?\n\n\n\n[INFO] My husband dislikes my sister if it's relevant.\n\n\nUPDATE: So a lot of people on here brought up the possibility of my husband lying about the robbery that happened months ago and accusing the babysitter of stealing just so I can't hire any other babysitters. He was the one who discovered the \"robbery\" I never saw or talked her after he kicked her out. Upon reading the comments I'm now suspecting that he made this whole thing up. I'm going to contact the babysitter to get the whole story from..Hopefully I'm wrong but I will talk to her and see if her story contredicts his in any way.\n\nI'll keep you updated.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28610"}

He is really into it and I just started and climbing a few times a week. He\u2019s stupidly competitive about it and quietly insults beginners who are not as good which makes me feel self conscious because I\u2019m a beginner. \n\nLast night we were at the climbing gym again and he was doing a V6. There was about 6 people taking turns on the problem probably because it\u2019s a newly installed route and they were all failing. Then a girl came and flashed it. She made it so easy but at the end she didn\u2019t hold the final hold for 5 seconds and my bf called her out after she was done. Holding the last hold for 5 seconds is suppose to be the \u201cright way\u201d of finishing a route but she was doing it so easily she definitely could have. I think he was just being salty because she did it when he couldn\u2019t. She laughed and told him he didn\u2019t even start the problem correctly and walked off. I gave her a high five because she was walking towards me and did amazing at the problem (and knocked my bf off his high horse) and she was surprised but high fived me. \n\nMy bf turned to me and gave me a wtf look and wouldn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the night. When we were heading home he ranted that I couldn\u2019t be trusted to watch his back if I chose to take a stranger\u2019s side over him. I was shocked that\u2019s what he took from the climb and told him she shouldn\u2019t have nitpicked her when she clearly climbed it correctly and he got mad and argued I was suppose to take his side over people I don\u2019t even know.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28570"}

My sister was visibly bothered but she didn\u2019t say anything. As expected, everyone including my parents were too upset to think about him being there and were still welcoming towards him. They didn\u2019t speculate or react the way my sister thought they would. I knew they wouldn\u2019t. We were all focused on my brother. \n\nIt was a beautiful service. I\u2019m glad M was a part of this and that my brother got a proper send off. It was very difficult and it hurt so much to say goodbye. I really hope we did right by my brother and it was how he would\u2019ve wanted it.\n\nThank you to whoever suggested an urn necklace that M could keep some of my brother\u2019s ashes in. I brought this up to him and asked if that was something he wanted. I was going to get part for myself while my parents kept most of it. And then I would just split the ashes with M.\n\nM didn\u2019t know that was a thing but said he liked that idea. He got himself a beautiful pendant to keep the ashes in and he really loves it so thanks again to the person who commented this! It was a lovely suggestion and it means so much to him to have a piece of my brother with him at all times. \n\nI have still kept contact with M since the funeral. He\u2019s stopped by a couple times and has finally met my wife and daughter. I also try to see him when I have the chance just to make sure he\u2019s okay. This has understandably taken a huge toll on him. He told me he\u2019s started talking to someone to help cope with the grief, which I think is great. \n\nI myself had a bit of a wake up call that therapy was something I very much needed right away. My wife brought it to my attention that our 5 year old has noticed I\u2019ve stopped eating and now she doesn\u2019t want to either unless I do. \n\nDon\u2019t know I guess I haven\u2019t been able to eat because I feel like I don\u2019t deserve it if that makes any sense. \n\nIt hit me that what I\u2019m going through was starting to affect my family so I\u2019m currently looking up grief counseling in my area. I\u2019ve also made an effort to eat more in front of my daughter so she knows that I\u2019m fine and it\u2019s okay to eat, hiding the fact that it still makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nThings are still rough and wounds are yet to heal but we\u2019re all surviving. Thank you everyone for all your kindness and support. It was very reassuring to know that this was the right thing and M deserved to be there. Thinking back now, it should\u2019ve been a no brainer but emotions were high and it was better to get an outsiders perspective. I appreciate everyone\u2019s input and I hope you all have a wonderful day!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28551"}

Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is \"addicted\" to doing it.\n\n I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me).

Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \nHe told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out. \n\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28397"}

Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we\u2019d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn\u2019t find out until 20 years later. \n\nTori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he\u2019s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. \n\nHe\u2019s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It\u2019s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he\u2019s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it\u2019s been completely different since he found out about Chris.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn\u2019t matter. Any time we\u2019d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I\u2019d ask him how classes or friends were and he\u2019d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn\u2019t even mention it to me until a year later. \n\nI told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he\u2019d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\n\nWhat was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris\u2019 because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I told him this \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are going to do this. That\u2019s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I\u2019m no longer your Father and I don\u2019t want to be involved in your life.\u201d \n\nHe hung up on me. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn\u2019t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he\u2019s 22).\n\nMy family told me I\u2019m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it\u2019s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\n\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn\u2019t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn\u2019t contact me. I didn\u2019t contact them. I needed a break.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he\u2019s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \n\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \n\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son\u2019s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this \u201cAdam, you haven\u2019t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn\u2019t sit well with me. That\u2019s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I\u2019m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.\u201d Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \n\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex\u2019s affair. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28383"}

I (26F) also have 2 kids. \n\nMy apartment complex didn\u2019t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.\n\nResidents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional \u201cknock on door, physically hand strangers candy\u201d was not permitted.\n\nSo, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn\u2019t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.\n\nThe next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded \u201cnope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night\u201d \nI was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.\n\nShe said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a \u201ctax.\u201d\n\nHer son then chimes in and said \u201cyou only took two bags from us!\u201d \nshe responded with \u201cbut I\u2019m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax\u201d \n\nI was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said \u201chey, aren\u2019t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. \u201c\n\nI explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.\n\nShe was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. \n\nNow she\u2019s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won\u2019t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.\n\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn\u2019t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.\n\nEdit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn\u2019t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. \n\nAs for the authenticity of her vegansim- \nI may have exaggerated when I said \u201csuper vegan\u201d when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it\u2019s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan \u201clifestyle\u201d if that makes sense. \n\nNow for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it\u2019s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can\u2019t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.\n\nI think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can\u2019t be vegan and not know these things. I\u2019m not vegan, I\u2019m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. \n\nAbout the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)\n\nEDIT #2 \nI cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren\u2019t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn\u2019t have told me what was actually wrong. \nTurns out he was calling me an asshole cause she\u2019s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven\u2019t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I\u2019m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn\u2019t stop. \n\nI also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28363"}

Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) \"Britney\"\n\n\nSo, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite.\n\nOlivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted.\n\n\nAt the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made \"slight changes\" to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no \"excuse\" to show favoritism and that her daughter is \"watching\" and \"observing\" how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine.\n\n\nMy wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be \"selfish\". I said that my daughter gets to act \"selfish\" on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now.\n\n\nAITA for returning the cake and not taking my wife's input into consideration?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28347"}

Then she brags about what she's cooking to make me look bad, especially if we're getting takeout. I used to care but not anymore. But my husband would ask me to make dinner only for him to go eat the dinner his mom makes at her home. which's 10 minutes away and using the \"that's my favorite meal\" excuse.\n\n\nYesterday, I wanted to surprise him by cooking one of his favorite meals and although I was busy, I took time off work to cook. I even went grocery shopping to get what I needed. Later as I was setting the table his mom called, I told him he didn't have to answer but he did. like usual...she asked what we were having but acted surprised that I cooked this meal. She then went on to tell him she cooked X meal and told him to come over. He said ok which shocked me, I said \"seriously?\" as he started dresing up getting ready to leave. he told me no offense but this meal (that his mom cooked) was even more of a favorite than the one I cooked. and grabed his keys and left.\n\n\nI felt awful. I took his plate and threw it out then ate my portion. As I was about to put the plate in the dishwasher, he got home looking angry saying his mom lied about cooking that favorite meal, and used it as an excuse to force him to eat dinner with her. I was shocked but he sat down telling me to go ahead and reheat dinner. I told him no dinner after he abandoned it, I threw it out. He said what?? and I told him he disrespected my time and effort and chose to go eat woth his mom instead. He began yelling at me asking if I really did that then called me petty and horrible then went upstairs saying what I did was 100 times worse than what his mom did.\n\nI definately feel like I let my anger and frustration get the best of me but it really felt unbearable having to live like this for so long. By the way [I'm 26 and he's 28].\n\nETA to make one thing clear and that's the fact that my husband only does this when it comes to food. He lived with his mom (attended community college) and loved and still loves her food and is used to it. She gave me recipes to make and I try to do that but he keeps switching homes just to eat what he feels like.\n\n\n\n**UPDATE** Hi \ud83d\udc4b I posted my situation here almost 24hrs ago and haven't really read every single comment because - Wow there's just too many. I saw few pieces of advice and encouregment and I'm so so thankful for them \ud83d\udc9d. But just wanted to let you guys know something since this is a throwaway account and I will be abandoning it soon. I just wanna let you know that I will be sitting down with my husband soon (after he breaks the silence I'm just giving him the space he said he wanted) and I'm going to show him this post in hopes he'd see how none of this was my fault. I will also be pushing for couples counseling although he's always been against it but we'll see how things go...I'm not gonna lie I still feel upset and like my efforts aren't being appreciated, His mom is definately onto something with her little upsetting stunts. I realize how important boundaries are - but also realize how enforcingbcan he difficult. I'm hoping and praying that we will tackle this issue so that our marriage won't suffer but if he's still somehow unable to do his part then that's on him and I'm no longer willing to go through similar stuff and just take it you know.\n\n\nSo yeah, This is it. I honestly didn't realize my post was going to gain this much attention. I might add my original account just in case some of y'all wanted to talk (got plenty of time and space for internet besties because my INBOX was blowing up lol) and maybe I will post updates from there if I could.

It turns out that some of the more pessimistic of you were right, Jane was being obsessive and stalkerish and it sort of all came tumbling down on her at that point. A week or so after I made my post she decided to message me, well it came down to her not understanding why I was showing interest in her and then refused to date her(I never showed interest in her beyond basic friendliness.), A wall of text dedicated to thrashing my previous relationships and calling them all sorts of names, specifically pointing out how I dated the \"Wrong girls\" and a weird rant about how everyone agreed me and her were meant to be, which just isn't the case, like I said in my previous post, there is a running joke in our friend group about how weird she is.\n\nNow, you might think this is something that can be expected, something that just happens, an outlet for her of sorts, except, she send it from the wrong account. See, I had become internet friends with a person In the past month or two, me and her would game together, chat from time to time, you know, the usual organic internet friend situation. And the messages concerning out \"Date\" were sent from this account, turns out she had literally used this alias to infiltrate my \"internet\" friend group and keep tabs on me of sorts? Obviously this freaked me the fuck out, I took screenshots of what she had sent me and afterwards blocked all accounts that I knew now she was using.\n\nI followed that up by sharing everything in our friend discord and in our friend whatsapp group, so everyone could see which resulted in her being kicked from both and I later got a call from Joe full on apologetic, telling me he had no idea and he knew he shouldn't have done it but that his girlfriend was being pressured by Jane, turned out, Jane had literally been bitching at her for months to arrange something like this and she finally caved, again creepy stuff, I told him that I needed some time as he really fucked me over bigtime and I didn't trust him anymore as a result.\n\nWhile Jane has been shunned by all friends, she still contacted me twice, once to apologize which quickly turned into weird shit where she started talking about \"Us\" she seems convinced there is an us and I am interested and another time just to curse at me, both from random accounts. I am not sure where to go from here and I am still pretty shook up.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28245"}

I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.\n\nHowever, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.\n\nMy father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.\n\nSince both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.\n\nShe was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.\n\nMy wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.\n\nI have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?\n\n**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.

Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28181"}

I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28164"}

I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.\n\nHis SIL \u201cKay\u201d (39) is the one who is \u201cknown\u201d for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they\u2019re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because \u201cthey are not Kay\u2019s\u201d.  Yes, I\u2019ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  \n\nTo be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete\u2019s family agrees.\n\nWe had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. \n\nWe got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they\u2019re in car and I\u2019ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay\u2019s.\n\nAfter we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay\u2019s.  She didn\u2019t notice at first and then asked if they weren\u2019t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.\n\nKay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That\u2019s when I said, \u201cOh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.\u201d\n\nHer husband said he hadn\u2019t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said \u201cyeah, they were okay.\u201d  Kay didn\u2019t say anything the rest of the night.\n\nPete thought it was funny (he didn\u2019t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay\u2019s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I\u2019m just mad that Kay is a better baker.  But Pete said it\u2019s ridiculous the family, including Kay, puts down my baking when they won\u2019t even try it all because I\u2019m not Kay. AITA?\n\nETA:  We aren\u2019t the only two who bring desserts, just the ones who tend to bake cake more than others.  Everyone else\u2019s desserts get eaten to some degree except mine.\n\nEdit 2:  If it\u2019s not clear, \u201ceveryone\u201d includes Kay.  She has often tried to \u201cteach\u201d me techniques that I either already knew or were completely wrong.  So she wasn\u2019t like an innocent that got caught in the line of fire or something.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28156"}

One thing I\u2019ve always done is build him toys and furniture. It was a way of providing without the awkwardness of handing over cash. Also, between my late brothers cash and life insurance via work a trust was setup for my nephew for ~\u00a3500,000. He wasn\u2019t actually married to my SIL.\n\nNow via the lab at work I\u2019ve made him a lot of wooden or 3d printed toys, but also some simple handmade electronic toys. My sister in law was always grateful for these and my nephew (by all accounts) loves his custom toys.\n\nFast forward 3 years and my former sister in law has gotten married. I was attending my nephews third birthday and I turned up the night before to assemble his present. It was a small climbing frame/Swing set I had watched better carpenters than me in the lab make.\n\nThe new husband was a little standoffish but come the day of the party he was telling anyone who listened that I didn\u2019t pay or make the present I had lackies at work do it for free. This culminated in him calling all my \u201cpresents\u201d an embarrassment and given my fancy job I could afford to splash some cash.\n\nI confronted him and my former SIL and she basically confirmed that whilst the presents were appreciated she honestly expected more direct support from me after my brothers death. My mother stepped in and reminded her my brother paid for this house and they regularly take cash out of the trust (approx \u00a310,000 a year).\n\nWe walked out without hearing any worthwhile response but I continued to see my nephew without incident. 6-7 months go by and I\u2019m visiting only to be told my former SIL was pregnant with twins and she was wondering if I could make some duplicates of items I made for my nephew as they needed two sets.\n\nI scoffed, said she had balls asking me to make stuff after she was so ungrateful and I owe her unborn children very little. She got upset and explained her prior statements about my handmade gifts and said she felt they were the kinda little things someone did as a favour. Not what a family provides. That\u2019s why she\u2019s asking me now as a friend to do her a \u201cfavour\u201d and manufacture duplicates.\n\nI said no, again, and her husband shouted through that it didn\u2019t matter they would just use the trust to provide for kids like it\u2019s supposed to. I retorted that it was for my nephew and good luck accessing it for that because the trust requires my signature to pay out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even home before he was calling me to apologise, clearly unaware I held the reigns to my late brothers money. The apology was insincere and I asked to speak to my former SIL where I confirmed again I wouldn\u2019t be manufacturing her anything. I\u2019ll still be an uncle to my nephew and be impartial when it comes to her accessing my nephews trust but her husband has burned a lot my goodwill with this.\n\nAITA for not doing her a favour after all that?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28135"}
{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: perpetuallypolite \nMedia: text \nTitle: AITA for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28141"}

Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting \"Evidence against us.\" When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. \n\nBut I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. \n\nSome of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28119"}

I was surprised when his fianc\u00e9 asked me to be a bridesmaid because I barely know her, but she wants to have all siblings in the wedding. I made it clear that their wedding was during my final exam week, and while I was able to get an accommodation to take my last two exams early I still wouldn\u2019t be able to help much with planning or be present at things like a bachelorette party/bridal shower. She said this was fine, it would mostly just be to have an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen and for pictures.\n\nThere\u2019s a group chat that was created months ago that I would read through every couple of days to get updates on things I needed to do, namely to order a bridesmaid dress. Links were sent with three styles to choose from and we would be updated on colors later. So a couple weeks go by and I ask what color to order, bride says she still thinking about it. Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking\u2026 then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it\u2019s at the point that if I don\u2019t order this dress in a couple of days it won\u2019t be here in time. So I ask on Saturday what color. No response in the group chat to me.\n\nI asked again yesterday (Sunday) what color do I need to order? Then I\u2019m flooded with messages lambasting me for not ordering a dress yet, from her sisters and my sister and her. My sister called me, told me to \u201cget my sh\\*t together\u201d and \u201corder a dress already\u201d because my lack of preparedness is causing the bride intense anxiety because she doesn\u2019t think my dress will be here on time for the wedding now. She texted me this morning, \u201cdon\u2019t forget order your dress, love you\u201d with smiling and kissing emojis.\n\nStill, no one has told me what color! I\u2019ve scoured the group chat for a mention of dress colors or an image of a dress but only the maid of honor sent a photo of her dress and I don\u2019t know if she has a special color. There\u2019s thousands of messages so it\u2019s not simple to find anything. Everyone else can meet in person so I assume the decision on color was relayed in person. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being purposefully excluded?\n\nAbout an hour ago my brother called me pleading with me to work things out with the bride because she\u2019s panicking about me. I tried to explain this to him and he told me he doesn\u2019t care, its a petty ladies issue, and since I\u2019m not there for anything else this is the least I can do because the bride thinks I don\u2019t like her because I wouldn\u2019t come to anything. He\u2019s taking her side. They know I\u2019m in medical school, I have literally no say in my schedule. And I\u2019m on the other side of the country, 5.5 hours by plane.\n\nI\u2019m fed up with them and contemplating telling my instructors the wedding was moved and I will take my exams at the regular time. I\u2019d have more time to study that way anyway. I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family I\u2019m considering this. WIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I called my mother and asked her what color the bridesmaid dresses are, she said lavender. The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride\u2019s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn\u2019t remember the shade name but its a \u201cdusty purple\u201d then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was \u201cmulberry.\u201d On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.\n\nI sent her a screen shot with the list of shade names and asked, \u201cwhich of these?\u201d She said she didn\u2019t know because everyone ordered their dress so long ago and asked for pictures of the dresses in different shades from the website. So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was \u201clook, I don\u2019t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.\u201d\n\nI ignored the lecture/comments and asked: \u201cwhat color?\u201d\n\nHer response? \u201cLight purple\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cof the three I sent, which one is it?\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cI don\u2019t remember, I\u2019ll have to ask one of the other bridesmaids for her receipt, I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d\n\nI want to bash my head into a wall!\n\nI called my second brother, the one not getting married. He said they\u2019re pulling similar things with him and he feels like he was deliberately given the wrong dates for the bachelor party by the best man (bride\u2019s brother) so that he would miss it. He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn\u2019t have missed much since he probably won\u2019t enjoy any of the \u201cfestivities\u201d anyway. They\u2019ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he\u2019s been ignoring but he thinks they\u2019re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick update: I was seriously considering pulling out, but the collective rage here and my fading motivation to study has me thinking\u2026 by this point, with how this post took off, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they find it at some point so I don\u2019t want to reveal my cards just yet. Thank you to the comments that gave me the idea. I guess I\u2019ll be making an update mid June if it all goes to plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL UPDATE\n\nThanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color \u201cflint\u201d one in \u201cmulberry.\u201d The MOH was setting me up to believe \u201cmulberry\u201d was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a \"mulberry\" dress.\n\nI caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress. The bride begins crying because it\u2019s \u201ctoo late to fix it!\u201d She asks if I would be upset if asked to drop out because mulberry is for the MOH.\n\nI pretended like I had made such a big mistake! I said, \u201cI know a girl that works at the salon. Let me call her and see if there\u2019s anyway to make it right, and if not I\u2019ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.\u201d I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. \u201cMy friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds! Exact style, color and my size, it\u2019s a sign!\u201d\n\nSilence. Then an awkward, \u201cthat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest, I thought the revenge would be that they had to have me and younger brother in the wedding and photos. I couldn\u2019t have planned the next part. They had to explain to the makeup artist there was an additional bridesmaid meaning they planned from the beginning that I wouldn't be in this wedding.\n\nThe ceremony went fine. We took photos after.\n\nThen, there were no place settings for me and little bro with the wedding party at the reception since banked on one less bridesmaid and one less groomsman being present. The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn\u2019t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.\n\nBefore he (groom) left he found me and said he asked the MOH why the setting were wrong and he was told I asked to be dropped from the wedding party weeks ago then showed up and demanded to be in the wedding.\n\nI said I didn't ask to be dropped and showed him my phone where she gave me a thumbs up on the dress. He noticed the screenshot was not the dress I was currently wearing so I said I had to last minute switch it out after confusion on the color. He seemed satisfied with that.\n\nThey left on their honeymoon, and my brother returned several days early\u2026 alone. So, you can guess how that went.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28108"}

They asked if we *even still* considered having a wedding. I said why not but they were very upset especially mom and dad who said they've always been known for their decency and good christian values and weren't willing to let this \"stain\" their reputation. as in my wife and I getting married while pregnant. They officially dropped out and refused to negotiate saying it was done and I have only myself to blame for this outcome and should move the wedding out of town. I was hurt I tried to change their minds and checked with other members but;\n\nMy brother said he had no intentions to look like a joke infront of his fellow church members and dropped out, My aunt pretended to be sick and said she may not be able to make it, She's 100% healthy, My cousin said he had business trip and stopped his wife and kids from attending and my uncle cussed me out, torn the invitation and kicked me out.\n\n\n\nI felt terrible with no family members of my own to support me and share my joy at my wedding. I even broke down crying after the ceremony. I haven't spoken to them for months and then got busy with my 4 weeks old daughter.\nMy cousin reached out to hand me gifts and well wishes for the birth of my daughter sent from my family. I returned everything. He sat with me on behalf of the family saying I shouldn't have returned gifts that were from my family who want to see and hopefully be involved in my daughter's life. He said mom',s longing to meet her grand baby and everyone else is wanting to visit soon to celebrate my daughter's life. I asked him this question, I said wasn't my daughter the reason why the entire lot of them abandoned my wedding?. He just stared grudgingly as I went on about how they treated my daughter as something to be ashamed of and hide (my daughter at some point will ask about the wedding and I have no intentions on lying to her). He replied saying he *guaranteed* I got it all wrong and nomatter what goes down between us I can never deny that my daughter is their granddaughter/niece/etc and they're her family. He asked that I arrange for them to visit but I refused. He kept pressing the idea but I shut him down.

They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. \n\nMy sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.\n\nI don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. \n\nWhen Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. \n\nAmy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. \n\nThe final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. \n\nI was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. \n\nUnfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. \n\nAmy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28111"}

My sister sucks. She is a horrible self slcentered person who thinks she is the main character.\nShe is not only a horrible person, she is a step monster.\n\nShe married this guy... Who is a freaking push over... 3 years ago. He has two children. 10 and 6. My sister constantly complains about them. Saying things like the 6 year old is gross because he sips too loud or has stained clothing. For the love of god.... He is 6. That's what a child is supposed to do. And she is so mean to the 10 year old girl. She acts straight out jealous of her. I've caught her taunting her, that daddy loves my sister more than her. She is horrible.\n\nI have straight up called her out (after trying to talk to her like a million times) . At Christmas she was saying, that I'd be nice to have the kids there and I said \"why... You hate them?\". This was when everything was almost over and she had been bragging to her friends that her husband had spend more on her than on daughter. A fight ensued. My parents reprimanded me but my cousins took my side and called her out, noting every moment that they had witnessed her being horrible. Her husband obviously took her side and said, that she was a wonderful step mother and that the kids love her. To which I said that was a lie, as I had consoled them countless times after they were taunted by my sister. They left and we haven't talked since.\n\nOne day I was running errands and run into my step nephews who were with their mother. I had never met her... And honestly she is wonderful. We decided to have some coffee. While the kids were playing, she asked me how her children behaved etc. I said they were wonderful and then I just spilled the beans on my sister. How awful she was. What I've heard her say to the kids, the inaction of her ex husband. By the end she was horrified. She said the kids didn't like her. But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father's life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I'd be willing to \"testify\". She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim.

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family.

She implied she'd be home before 9. She left at around 7:45.\n\n10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now.\n\n11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset\n\n12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry. \n\n1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read.\n\nAround 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry.\n\nAt 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time. \n\nI immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did. \n\nMy fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise. \n\nMy fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again. \n\nSo did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for informing me everyone. I am aware that my ex is posting deranged nonsense in the comments.

It's been like three weeks and many, many things have happened. I graduated high school (go me!), I turned 18, and I moved out! I finally feel like I'm adulting, kind of. I moved in with my sister the day after my birthday, and I've been living with her for a bit over two weeks. It's been really weird.\n\nThey do all of this stuff in her house that we never did as kids. Family dinners every night? Never done it once until now. My sister and her fiance carve out blocks of time to spend with the kids! My parents never did that. My oldest nephew (he's 10) dropped an open can of pineapple in the kitchen a few days ago. I expected him to get yelled at, but my sister just helped him clean it up and told him to grab a new can from the pantry. That was weird. My parents were never that chill.\n\nWhen I was a kid I would see these perfect families on TV, (shoutout to dinosaur train lmao) and my parents always told me that those kinds of parents didn't exist. That it was all made up for TV. That real parents don't take that much of an interest in their kid's lives and interests. I believed them until now.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I've seen my sister and her fiance spend hours making model planes with my oldest nephew, or rocking the youngest to sleep when she was overtired. That stuff never happened when I was a kid. My niece (she's 4) woke up in the middle of the night last week, crying about something. Instead of telling her to stfu and go to bed, my sister's fiance got up and sat with her until she fell asleep. I guess I was just surprised that my experiences aren't the norm.\n\nAnyway, both my brother and I are doing really well here. My brother has been cooking a lot (he's going to culinary school), and everyone seems to really appreciate it. I've been spending time with my nieces and nephew and I have played more Minecraft these past two weeks than I think I've played in my entire life. If anyone knows what Titanfall 2 is, please help me out. I've been an adult for less than a month and these children and their new-fangled video games already confuse me.\n\nThis is all just a very long winded way to say thanks. If I hadn't posted here, I don't think I would have moved out. My savings would basically be drained, and I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. So thank you. Now I guess it's time to see if I can figure out how to do an update post.\n\n\n\nEdit: Shoutout to my sister for basically raising me for twelve years and also being an amazing parent. I could just go and say all this to her face but there's so many stairs in this house and I'm lazy. \n\nKalani. How many times am I going to have to say it before you accept that you're a good person? Every time I go to thank you for giving up space in your house for me and Cam, you say that if you didn't help us out, it would have been someone else. I get that you have strangely low self esteem (as evidenced by your AITA post) but can you just accept that you're an unbelievably good person and move on so I can finally thank you?\n\nEdit #2: I have enough advice on Titanfall, thank you guys. I didn't realize it had such a big community. I now know how to beat every single campaign boss plus why I should definitely use a Scorch in the last boss battle.

{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: amiwrong6321 \nMedia: text \nTitle: AITA for forcing my tomboy daughter to wear formal clothing? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nHi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.\n\nHowever, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.\n\nBut, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.\n\nShe got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.\n\nSome of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into \"streetwear.\" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?\n\nI think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.\n\nThat being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.\n\nParenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28054"}

It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\n\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\n\nedit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually.\n\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\n\nEdit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\n\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks!\n\nEdit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her.

He and his father calculated how much I\u2019ve been paid in child support over the years and they decided it would be a good idea to let me know how little a drop in the bucket the gaming system would be. I told him I spend that on his expenses every month but he didn\u2019t believe me, so I told him that if he doesn\u2019t think so, he can pay me for his expenses every month and I\u2019ll give him the child support.\n\nSurprise surprise, when I gave him the bill, it showed that when you factor in all of the things I pay for in a month, it\u2019s much more than child support.

I have published many papers and been a co author of even more. I've done field studies and teach at a uni. Basically, I know my field.\n\nI speak a few langues and teach a group of people outside of work. We meet up once a week and talk in that language. We are all friends and it's very casual. Last week one person of the group asked if they could bring a mate (K) from work who's interested in the language too. She said that her mate is on the spectrum and that he might not know when to stop talking. I said bring him along and we'll see how he fits in.\n\nThe actual lesson went well and I think we were all happy. Usually some people stick around for a bit after and we just have a few drinks. This is when it started. As it turns out K is interested in my field of study. He asked me some questions and I was happy to answer. But then it started getting weird. He kept arguing with me and \"correcting\" me, telling me what I apparently misunderstood and so on. It was quite awkward and my other friends tried to gently let him know that he was probably out of line. He kept asking me about my opinion on studies and papers but in an aggressive almost questioning way. \n\nThe last straw was when he told me that I misinterpreted the findings of a study that I was a co author of. I was sick of it and said \"listen buddy, I know you think that you know everything about this field but if you had actually bothered to read who \"et al\" is then you'd know that I wrote this fucking paper so please just shut up\" not my proudest moment I admit but at this point he'd been trying to \"beat me\" for over 30 minutes. He left after that but later messaged me that he'd inform my uni of my discriminatory behaviour towards people with autism.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I went too far.\n\nEdit typo\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28017"}

He doesn't have enough money. I'm in medicine school and have been getting ready for my exams for a month now. Every month he and his friends go on a road trip. His car's been sitting in the garage for 3 months now. He asked if he could take my car to take the guys on a road trip since it was his turn to take them. I told him I need the car since I have a weak immune system and public transportation might be risky. And I can't afford to get sick in the middle of my exams. He begged saying his friends are gonna say he ruined the trip and our discussion got nowhere.\n\n\nThe trip was last week. I had an exam the day of the trip and left at 8am. I had several things to do. I stopped by the coffee shop to use the internet. I arrived at the university at 8:30 and entered the hall getting ready for my exam.\n\nAfter I finished. I spent few minutes with my friends then I left. I got to the parking lot and my car wasn't there, I started freaking out. Thinking I might've left the door open or something. I called my husband but he didn't pick up. My friends immediately told me to call The Police. I ended up waiting for them to ask me about what happened. The Officer said I needed to come to the station to give my statement.\n\nI stayed there for 4 hours then I was told my car was found. my husband was driving it and was picked up an hour away from where we live. I was shocked. And mad. It never occured to me that he was the one who took it. I went home and waited til he got back. He was upset and didn't want to talk about what he did. The argument started after he said he made a copy of the key and didn't take til he made sure I arrived for my exam. I yelled at him and told him it was not okay. He caused me to stress out and worry about the car. He told me calling the police was drastic and shouldn't have gotten them involved but I had no idea he took the car. He said he wanted to text me but forgot. Said the trip was ruined and he was embarrassed by being picked up by the police while he was with friends. He still thinks calling the police was over the top reaction but what was I supposed to do.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28013"}

Totally unexpected, but very much appreciated by my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nAs I mentioned a couple times in the comments of my original post, my fianc\u00e9 and I wrote up a Facebook post to explain the situation to our families (mostly mine), including screenshots of texts with my brother (I decided I didn't want to link the post here as it feels a little too personal to be slapping on Reddit. Sorry!) \n\nAs expected, once the family heard our side of the story and put everything together, many of them changed their tune. Most of the family members who had been calling me an asshole ended up apologizing and siding with me and my fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy brother was livid. He called me about an hour after the post went up and demanded that I take it down because it \"made him look bad\". He said he was being unfairly attacked, and even blamed me for his girlfriend breaking up with him.\n\nMy brother has formally been banned from the entire wedding, and we've asked any family members who continue to side with him to RSVP that they will not be attending. Our parents aren't happy with the turnout, and my mother has decided she won't be attending my wedding because of how I'm \"alienating\" my brother during an important event. I don't mind; I've never been very close with her, and while it is a bit sad that she's choosing my hardheaded brother over my wedding, I still have my father's full support.\n\nMy brother's (now ex) girlfriend is still invited and got promoted to bridesmaid because of how helpful and supportive she's been to my fianc\u00e9. Hopefully this is the last issue we'll run into during wedding planning! \n\nI hope this update lives up to any expectations. I never expected I'd be in this situation, but I'm glad so many people on this sub got a kick out of it, and very grateful for the advice and support I received.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 28001"}

My husband and I have been married for three years now, I have a daughter (15F) and he has a son (24M). I am friendly with my stepson, but we aren't close. He has a biological mother who is a perfectly fine woman, I'm not here to take the role of his mom. \n\nMy late husband (my daughter's father) died when my daughter was 6, we both contributed to her college fund. My daughter's paternal grandparents have also contributed a large amount. Right now, the fund has about $180,000. My daughter is extremely bright, and I'm not just saying that because I'm her mom. I truly believe she has the capacity to go to an Ivy league school, and her teachers have said she has the potential as well, and I don't want costs to hold her back. Our income would be too high to get any meaningful financial aid, and while there are a few merit based scholarships out there that she will be applying too, we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket and hope she gets it when it's so competitive. My current husband and I have separate finances, he doesn't contribute at all to my daughter's fund.\n\nMy stepson is struggling with a heroin addiction, and has stolen money, jewelry, hierlooms, and electronics from us for drug money. I understand that addiction is a disease, and I personally paid for an outpatient detox for him, which cost $1000, which failed. His father then paid for an outpatient rehab program, which cost $6500, which also didn't work because he barely showed up. He promised us he'd do better next time and he needed another chance, so I split the cost of another $6500 outpatient rehab program with my husband, which seemed to work during program, but he relapsed as soon as he got out of it. I have spent so much money, time, and energy and it hasn't helped at all.\n\nMy husband and my stepson want to try a 60-day inpatient rehab program, which will cost $30,000. I had absolutely no idea where they were supposed to get the money for that, considering the thousands and thousands of dollars that were already spent, and the fact that we no longer had anything of value in our house. They want to use my daughter's college fund, which to me is absolutely off-limits. I feel like it's completely unfair to my daughter to punish her for my stepson's addiction, unfair to my late husband and his parents, but frankly, I don't think spending $30,000 will work. My husband thinks I'm an asshole because I'm prioritizing my daughter's education over his son's life, and he believes medical needs come first. \n\nHe then asked my daughter if she'd be willing to use $30,000 from her fund to pay for her stepbrother's rehab, and she got very quiet and did not answer. He then got very upset with her and said she was being selfish. My daughter later told me that she didn't want to give her stepbrother the money, but she felt so guilty, and I am furious at my husband for emotionally guiltripping my daughter like that.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27981"}

As a result, when our middle daughter and her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. With sixteen years of hindsight, I can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. \n\nNothing happened in particular. My daughter just doesn't like her cousin. My wife keeps pushing the relationship. This includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. \n\nWe're pretty sure I'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. From my perspective, this isn't important, and I do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. I'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. \n\nThis is where I'm probably an asshole. Yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. My daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: \"Unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family\". The call occurred. This morning, we awoke to a PowerPoint presentation titled *Valid Reasons to Dislike \\[Cousin\\].* Using clips from the zoom call, segments included *Why is \\[Cousin's\\] Voice so Grating? A Music Theory Approach, A Case Study: Conversations That Provide No Value*, *Rethinking the Idea That There Are No Dumb Questions*, ect. With the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. \n\nMy wife was furious. My eldest daughter and I lost our shit laughing. My wife is demanding I support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. I have refused because I feel this is whole situation wouldn't have occurred if she didn't push the relationship, but I'm starting to have second thoughts because it was very mean.

The TLDR is I have a friend, Kate, and I wanted her to be my best man. My fianc\u00e9e disapproved and we got into a fight about it.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I ended up making up and reconciling a few days later. We were talking compromises and it was still a touchy subject but I thought it was going good and we\u2019d recover. I wish I could leave it at that.\n\nShe\u2019s now my ex-fianc\u00e9e. A little over two weeks after our fight a friend of Jas contacted me. She told me Jasmin had been venting to her friends over the Kate situation and she couldn\u2019t keep quiet any longer because it wasn\u2019t fair to me. This friend sent me messages between Jasmin and them where Jasmin is essentially talking about not trusting me and Kate and saying some pretty derogatory things about her. If that was it I\u2019d be angry but not furious. Long story short, the conversation turns into some confusing conversation I didn\u2019t have much context for, but I got the gist. The friend that sent me the messages filled me in with what she knew. \n\nBasically Jas had an affair before we got engaged. It had allegedly been just one time with some guy she doesn\u2019t talk to anymore, but I don\u2019t know what to believe. Based on the messages it seems like that was the case. Apparently all of her friends knew about this and I was being played the whole time.\n\nI talked to Jas and she denied it but I told her I didn\u2019t care, she needed to leave. She was throwing a fit and refused to, so I left my own home again because of her. Told her I\u2019d tell everyone what she did if she didn\u2019t pack up her shit and go by the time I returned. It worked, two days later I came back and she was gone. She\u2019s tried contacting me to \u201cset things right\u201d but I\u2019m not interested. She can keep the ring for all I care at this point, I just don\u2019t want to see her yet.\n\nI felt so stupid and worthless and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t tell anyone the reason we broke it off. No idea what Jas is telling people, and I don\u2019t care. The past month and a half has been a nightmare, but I\u2019ve been slowly recovering my pride, and I\u2019m trying to convince myself what she did was her own fault, not mine. It works about half the time.\n\nAnd because I know some of you are going to ask because you think this is some shitty fucking romcom, I didn\u2019t go running to Kate. I\u2019ve hardly spoken to her or anyone else for a while now. I\u2019ve been enjoying quarantine and being left alone. \n\nThat\u2019s my final update on the situation, those of you who said Jas was being paranoid because she had something to hide can go pat yourselves on the back.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27953"}

I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay.

He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\".

For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. \n\nOut of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said \"Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work\". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. \n\nI go into the guest room and say \"Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house.\" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, \"You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before.\" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. \n\nNow my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free.

He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn\u2019t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn\u2019t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. \n\nI turned in my two weeks and he said \u201coh sweetie, you know you can\u2019t leave.\u201d I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you\u2019re here to stay.\u201d I got so furious and decided that was it. I said \u201cwell screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.\u201d Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. \n\nA former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I\u2019m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I\u2019m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I\u2019m curious, I thought I\u2019d ask here. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27854"}

The previous owner was a friendly old man that could no longer live alone so he decided to sell and move in with his daughter. Just to be clear I put disabled in quotation marks because the lady in question is just really really overweight and I am not sure if that counts as disabled.\n\nNow apparantly he had been allowing use of his driveway to his \"disabled\" neighbor lady largely because street parking is extremely limited and what little street parking there is, is pretty much instantly occupied. What I am saying is unless you have a driveway you end up having to park a good 5 minute walk away and that's the best case scenario.\n\nObviously I was unaware of this so I was surprised to see a large SUV parked in my driveway when I moved in. I ended up having to knock on several doors asking who's car it was because the movers could not stand still on the busy road too long. I figured out it was the neighbors car so after a good 10 minutes of knocking an extremely angry enormous lady opened the door. I told her to move the car and she immediatly started arguing that the neighbor said it was fine, I told her he moved out, I moved in and no it is not fine and to move it because the movers need to unload my stuff. She begrudgingly did, I ended up seeing her walking back  half an hour later completely wet with sweat.\n\nNow a few days later I went back to work and lo and behold, the SUV is parked in my driveway again. I go over there again, spend 20 minutes knocking on the door before this lady opens the door, agaon, visibly angry. I tell her to move her car, my driveway is not public parking. She protests saying her ankles can't take walking the distance and claims I can easily walk, I tell her that while that might be true, it's my goddamn driveway and I want to park there myself. Again she moves her car, again I spot her half an hour later drenched in sweat making her way home.\n\nWell it happened again a week ago and this time she would not open her door, I got tired of it and had her SUV towed. She of course came to my house to scream at me, I told her to get the hell of off my property. A few days later I had a small fence installed with a lock on it to make sure it did not happen again.\n\nI have since been getting dirty looks from her and one other neighbor and when I told my mom she told me I should be nicer to people. I do feel sort of bad too, she clearly struggles with the walk after all.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27857"}

Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I\u2019m working in my downstairs office. \n\nI hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. \nIE: \nGuy: So where do you live ? \nHer: North of here\nGuy: Yeah but where?\nHer: It\u2019s kind of a weird spot\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, \u201cWhat is this? The census? She\u2019s watching my kid. Let her be. \u201c I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. \n\nI get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. \n\nAm I the A-hole?\n\n\nUpdate: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won\u2019t be back. To quote her, \u201cThe thirsty ones never get the hint.\u201d\n\nThe most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, \u201cIf you think that was bad you should check out my DM\u2019s\u201d. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It\u2019s just street flashing with less effort. It\u2019s insane and it\u2019s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. \n\nMy wife is deflecting from whether I\u2019m still the a-hole but I\u2019ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It\u2019s a give and take like anything in this world. \n\nAnyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the \u201cthirsty\u201d ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27831"}

Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left. \n \nI fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.\n\nHonestly it hasn\u2019t been easy. We\u2019re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.\n\nHis behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there\u2019s days where he\u2019s withdrawn.\n\nDays before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.\n\nMy girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.\n\nYesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. \n\nMy brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don\u2019t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he\u2019d think that and he told me what happened.\n\nThat day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I\u2019m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. \n\nI was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn\u2019t deny it. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I \u201cgave up my life\u201d to take care of him. \nAnd the thing about giving him up isn\u2019t that big of a deal to her because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll actually do it.\n\nI said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn\u2019t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.\n\nSince last night I\u2019ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. \n\nThey\u2019ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I\u2019m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: OK wow this has gotten a TON of feedback. Thanks everyone for your kind and encouraging words. I might not have replied to a lot of the comments that made me smile but just know that I read an appreciate them! \n\n\nI know I only posted this a few hours ago but I\u2019ve had a day to clear my head and really think about this. I talked to my brother because I wanted to know if she\u2019s said anything else to him. Thankfully she hasn\u2019t and we had another serious chat to remind him everything she told him is completely false. I would never in a million years give him up and that shouldn\u2019t have been put in his head. \n\nAnother thing I told him was that I\u2019m grateful he\u2019s here with me. Without him I wouldn\u2019t have made it through the year and I thanked him for giving me that strength to keep going. Someone who DM\u2019d me suggested reassuring him that he\u2019s not somehow \u201cruining\u201d my life incase he feels any guilt for what she told him. Thank you for that suggestion!\n\n\nNow, I know you were all waiting on this news. Yes, I did break up with her. Thinking about what a lot of you said, talking to my brother about how this made him feel, and my own thoughts about how badly she acted, I decided that\u2019s not someone I want around me or him. I can\u2019t risk her doing something like this again and ruining any progress he makes in therapy. \n\nI know many of you think I should\u2019ve done it on the spot, but I wanted to make this decision with a clear head and not when my emotions were extremely high. \n\nShe came by my place earlier and we talked outside. Her reaction was as bad as you\u2019d expect and she STILL believed she did nothing wrong, even after I explained it all to her. There was just no making her understand and I told her it was over. I gave her a couple of her things that were lying around my apartment and she left. \n\nMy phone started going off like an hour later so I had to put it on Do Not Disturb. That\u2019s all the drama I could handle for one night. I\u2019ll deal with my friends some other time. \nHonestly, I\u2019m exhausted. Mentally and emotionally drained right now. \n\nI think this weekend we\u2019ll do something  to get our minds off this. I definitely need it after everything and I know my brother does too. It\u2019s been a hard year already without all this extra drama. \nAnyways sorry for the really long update you guys but I didn\u2019t want to leave anyone hanging. \n\nI\u2019m sure more comments will keep coming. I probably won\u2019t be sleeping much tonight so I\u2019ll keep my mind busy by reading and replying to more of you. Thanks again for the support! What a shitty way to start the new year but here\u2019s hoping for better things :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27819"}

post.\nAssistant: \nMy older brother (30M) went to university and then worked in the city as an accountant, I (27M) stated to work for my dad as a plumber at 15 and went to college to get my qualifications in plumbing and gas, about the time covid started my brother moved back from the city and started working for my dad (55M) in accounting, my dad has been unwell for the last 4 years due to asbestosis it has been really hard on the family and he is getting worse but is still loving life. \n\nI have been running the business for the last 2 years we have expanded and now have 50 vans in the fleet and one qualified and one trainee allocated to each van, covid was hard in the beginning but we have bounced back, my dad still works on tools with me on Fridays (half day then back to my place for some beers), Friday is the only day I\u2019m on tools now as I\u2019m doing everything to run the business.\n\nwell last month he told the family he is stepping down from the business due to health and wants to spend more time with my mother, and is giving the business to my brother and for me to step down from acting CEO, this upset me iv been with the business for 12 years, at the beginning it was only me and my dad my brother never wanted to be in the business said it was not worth his time and now he\u2019s the boss, and iv been dumped back to a heating engineer with a \u00a320,000 pay cut, he doesn\u2019t have any clue what we do or how to do it. \n\nI spoke to my dad and he told me that my brother deserve it for all he has done, that he has a family and I don\u2019t and that he went to uni , a lot of the workers are upset about the decision and have told me they will go where I go. \n\nI told my dad that if that is how he feels then I will leave and start my own business I have not spoke to my dad or brother since and have told them to never contact me, for the last month Iv had thousands of calls and messages from family saying some very hurtful things and telling me I\u2019m ungrateful for what I have so AITA???\n\nEDIT I want to say thank you to everyone for your kind words there are so many to reply to I will do my best to thank you all, to hear my father tell me in his own way he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough was hard and for my family to take his and my brother side was even harder. \n\nIn the morning I will contact the large clients iv worked with over the last 6 years I know we had some site postponed due to covid (big money), and will try and take them over I have 20 of my colleagues wishing to come work for me iv saved nearly all of the money I have earned over the last 12 years so think I have enough to get myself on my feet.\n\nUpdate I want to inform everyone that I\u2019m not starting a business to destroy my brother, as much as I want to iv spent almost 13 year build it and I don\u2019t want to see anyone out of a job or for the business to die it\u2019s about 0500 in England you have all helped me so much. \n\nI will be going over to talk to my father about 0800 and take him out for breakfast and talk, I\u2019m not sure if I will get a proper answer from him but I love my family and want my future kids to know them. \n\nI will update after the events of later today.\n\nUpvoted 2: as I said in one of the comments I believe my family had found my post and they did.\n\nThis morning when I arrived at my parents house my mum opened the door and looked like she had been cry a lot my dad came over to talk to me and we went out for breakfast, he didn\u2019t say a word on the way there or when we arrived, when on the way back he asked if we could pull over and talk I can honestly say this was the first tile I saw my dad cry, I asked why he did this to me he said doesn\u2019t know I keeper pushing and he finally told me he owed it to my brother for not being about for him as much as me when we were growing up and there was times my brother needed him but we was working. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it after 12 years of hard work that was his reasoning I told me father I had spent half my life working to do everything for the business and how he throw me to the side just because he\u2019s son came back hurt more then I could explain, he told me he knows as they had been shown the post I put up, to my surprise he wasn\u2019t mad he seemed remorseful, he told me my mother has been in pieces after reading the comments about how bad she treated me and thinks I will never talk to them again, my dad told me after reading it all he released he should have split the business between us as it will need both of us to keep progressing and apologies to me for never telling me how proud he was of everything I had done and thought I know how proud he was, but my brother has full control my father has no say any more and my brother would never go 50/50, he told me he wants me to go back as my brother will need me I told him that\u2019s not my problem anymore after the demoted me and cut my pay I tried to make it work for 3 weeks but my brother wouldn\u2019t listen didn\u2019t believe I know what I was talking about telling me he knows how to fun a business, so I left why work my ass off there when I could do the same work and make more money for my self. \n\nMy dad broke down said that he had destroyed the family and should never had done what he did I don\u2019t understand why I took this long to release I was a valuable piece in the company.\n\nUpdate 3: as I said I have had a couple of zoom calls with some clients today and they have gone very well, I have been informed that they we all be sending be signed proposal letters for the up and coming work, lucky the site start dates don\u2019t clash that was one of the main things I was worried about, 3 of my colleagues have now left the business and have spoken to my dad informing him about why they left and that they will be coming to work with me under there own choice, to hear them tell me this meant a lot, they all have between 5 - 10 year more experience in the industry, at the moment I have all we need to start a new business with the 3 vans I own and tools I have built up over the years, I am looking forward to the new venture in my life and can\u2019t wait to share this with my children when I have them.\n\n\nThen I received a call from my father asking me to come over for dinner I was unsure at first but thought it was probably a step in the right direction, on arrival my whole family was there, I went in and the atmosphere dropped my mum wouldn\u2019t look at me and my brother just sat there acting as if I didn\u2019t exist, my dad came and asked me and my brother to come in to his office, he started to ask when I was going to return to the company as they need me in early Monday morning, I could not even believe what I was hearing I told them both I\u2019m not coming back and have started my own company, and what dose he mean we you gave the business to him (my brother), my brother stated to lose his temper telling me if I cared about to company why would I leave, I have some very choice words before telling him that I have always cared for the company and spent 12 years of my life working to make it successful, unlike him who swans in and takes all the glory and that i will not sit there and be treated like that, I told my brother to f**k off so I could talk to dad, I asked what was this morning all about telling me he\u2019s sorry but then expects me to going running back, he couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye so I left said goodbye to my cousin, nieces and nephews and walked out iv been riding for about 3 hours on and off coming back on here to talk to people. \n\nI just want to say thank you to everyone for the personal message, comments, rewards and all the kind words and encouragement I\u2019ll try and message everyone but I\u2019m exhausted and will most likely fall asleep.\n\n\nUpdate 4: sorry it\u2019s been a while iv had a lot going on in the last couple of weeks, I\u2019ll try and explain the most I can, so the new business is going very well we have a lot of work coming in and making good money, at the end on the year I will be looking at expanding so very happy with that.\n\nme and my fianc\u00e9 are very happy she is very busy planning the wedding of her dreams she wants me to wear a suit but tough lucky I\u2019ll be in my kilt, I couldn\u2019t be happier then I am right now waking up to her every day, she is there for me no matter what and has been my rock through everything.\n\nThen my family my father and brother still refuse to talk to me and have told me they will not be attending the wedding even though they haven\u2019t been invited, my mother has called my fianc\u00e9 but hasn\u2019t said much only to ask about wedding stuff and will not talk to me, my fianc\u00e9 family have been amazing my soon to be in-laws have been helping with the wedding and everything else and I am extremely thankful for everything they have done for us.\n\nMy other family have now backed off and apologised and want to make amends for everything that was said.\n\nMyself and my fianc\u00e9 are set to have are wedding in November, we sat down together and have decided to trying to have children after we are married, we are both excited to be parents.\nUser: How much karma did the post

I won\u2019t give too many details but he\u2019s well known in the academic circles of our country and attends an institute of higher education. Naturally people are impressed with his intelligence and he\u2019s quite popular and makes friends easily. Our parents dote on him and have never told him \u201cno\u201d. As a result he has become very arrogant, condescending and disrespectful to people he deems below him...that\u2019s just about everyone.  \n\nLately he\u2019s been openly talking about a girl he\u2019s crushing on and much to his dismay she\u2019s quite unimpressed with him. He often complains to my parents and I about his failed attempts to befriend her. \n\nI understand why she dislikes him. On one occasion he invited her over for a school project and I overheard their interaction. He was constantly talking over her, dismissing her ideas and even calling them stupid. 99% of the time he was talking about himself and his accomplishments, being in news articles, his future plans are etc. The poor girl obviously seemed uncomfortable. He quizzed her about her career aspirations and when she answered he proceeded to point out it\u2019s a bad career path. \n\nToday he was once again complaining about her and said that she\u2019s obviously intimidated by his superior intellect. He claimed that all girls only like \u201cstupid guys\u201d and that \u201cwomen are emotional\u201d.  Sadly my parents agreed and kept assuring him that this girl is obviously uncomfortable with the fact he\u2019s so accomplished and awesome.  \n\n\nAfter hearing this nonsense many times, I finally told him that his crush dislikes him because he behaves like an obnoxious, know-it-all asshole. \nI explained that he\u2019d probably have a chance if he showed some modesty instead of talking down on this girl so much. \n\nSo my parents obviously think I\u2019m an asshole for saying this. They said that it was horrible of me to say this to a 13 year old and that he\u2019s just a child. I told them that he needs to realise that his personality is becoming a problem and that his crush dislikes him because he\u2019s an AH, not because he\u2019s \u201ctoo smart\u201d.

My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.\n\nRecently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.\n\nThe night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.\n\nMy dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.\n\nHis wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.\n\nI was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.\n\nMy father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27750"}

Anyways, I decided to take your advice, and here\u2019s an update on the situation, for anyone that\u2019s interested!\n\nSo after reading a ton of your comments, I decided to call Joy and invite her over to talk. Luckily, she said yes (by the way, before this, she didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want to be at my wedding, so she was still planning on becoming a guest), and I apologized for kicking her out with no warning, but I laid out my frustrations. She apologized for being really picky about the dress and realized that the attention wasn\u2019t going to be on her and it wasn\u2019t her day, so it wasn\u2019t really appropriate for her to get upset over fine details on a dress. She also revealed to me that this was going to be her first time being a bridesmaid (she doesn\u2019t usually wear dresses, she\u2019s more of a leggings and sweatshirt type of girl). I took some of your guys\u2019 advice again and asked Joy to show me a couple of dresses online she would be comfortable with (didn\u2019t matter what color, I just wanted to see her style), and she searched for about 10 minutes and couldn\u2019t find one that she \u201cloved\u201d. She kind of looked bummed and a little apologetic, so I came up with a plan. The official dress shopping day for the bridesmaids was the next day, and I invited Joy to go with us, to get a feel for the dresses, to see if she would be comfortable. She agreed.\n\nSo the next day, my girls and I met up at a dress place, tried on a couple of dresses, and Joy didn\u2019t really like them, even though my other bridesmaids did. Finally, we tried on the 4th dress, which was THE one. The girls fell in LOVE with it, and I looked at joy and she was staring at herself in the mirror, but she had a smile on her face! :) I came up to her and told her again I didn\u2019t mind if she wore a shawl or cover up for some moments, and she nodded and smiled again. Actually one of my bridesmaids (who didn\u2019t really know about the situation) came up to joy and told her how gorgeous she looked in the dress. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears because they all looked so beautiful.\n\nSo we found a dress that was matching and all the girls were happy with, and Joy is back in the bridal party. Hope that this was a happy ending that everyone enjoyed :) Now for me, I have to go to plan other parts of the wedding with my fianc\u00e9:)\n\nEdit: I couldn\u2019t find the actual dress, but I did find something very similar online.\n\nhttps://www.kleinfeldbridalparty.com/shop/dresses/viewitem-KL2160586?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn8nqwo-q5wIVWgOzAB3N9wO6EAkYASABEgJuE_D_Bw\n\nEdit 2: and thank you guys for all the rewards!! <3. I just wanted to say that a little bit of communication can go a long way. I will admit that I was very stressed when helping my bridesmaids with the dresses, but having a simple conversation saved my friendship and my bridal party! I\u2019m so happy :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27716"}

My father married a goyishe woman less than a year later, who promptly did her best to have as many children as she could, and had 3 in as many years. She has two older kids too, who are 8 and 7 now. 6 kids is a lot, but it's a pretty big house. \n\nI'm the only grandchild on my mother's side, and the only granddaughter on either side. My grandparents typically gift me jewelry, and I got my mother's collection when she died. As a religious custom, we don't really do costume jewelry. All of my jewelry is real and not cheap. It sounds vulgar, but my entire jewelry collection is worth about 100k easily. \n\nI came home from seeing a friend and the oldest three had a PILE of my jewelry on the floor of their playroom. They had been jumping on it, smashing it and shooting at it with BB guns (yeah, my father allows that apparently). I screamed and got my father, who came with his wife and dismissed the entire thing.  \n\nThey destroyed multiple pieces, several of which were heirloom. My stepmother didn't really care. She pretended to yell at her brats. She later came home with a dollar store necklace that she \"made\" the kids get me and said that that should be enough and that I shouldn't have such \"idols\" or wear such \"sacrilegious crap\" (one of my necklaces is a star of david). \n\nI saw red at that. I got her to repeat it so I could record it. I emailed all of my grandparents, aunts and uncles detailing what happened, attaching the recording and pictures of the damage, and then I went to those brats' playroom and destroyed one of each of their favorite toys. \n\nMy grandparents are now suing my stepmother for $50,000 and half of my family now hates her. My father is furious and thinks that I should have kept it within the family and let him \"work it out\".\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27713"}

Like not actual court room judges, just people who were involved in stuff locally. The prize was some scholarship money for college. \n\nOur classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.\n\nIt was annoying how the \"outside judge\"kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??\n\nIt was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.\n\nSo I went up and said \"Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.\"\n\nShe sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. \n\nThe girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.\n\nMy principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detention\n\nAITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?\n\nEdit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27698"}

He seemed weird in our talk. (He's been weird a lot lately, but I have been excusing it.) He told me that he said to put him on as an insurance beneficiary partially as a joke but then when I \"went off\" on my tangent (including offering up that he'll never go on my house title either even though he never mentioned it) that he got offended and reacted poorly. He said he really did think I was going off about all that in retaliation for his \"no to marriage\" talks so he was left with a bitter taste. Which...I get. I can be more forceful than I realize and I am naturally passive aggressive. He said I didn't have to put him on anything but he needs me to understand that I am it for him. He wants to makes his life with me. Things seemed to be better after this.\n\nThat weekend he asked if I wanted to go on a hike. It was peak season for the leaves changing and there is this waterfall he suggested we go to. We get to the waterfall and he pulls an envelope out of his jacket with a tiny bow on it and says it's a present for me. I open it and it's a receipt from a jewelry store. I was confused but I see he had the date of purchase highlighted and circled with a heart - it was early August (before the talks we had where he said he never wanted to get married). I turn and there he is with a ring. I said yes.\n\nHe said he knew I would never believe that he had the ring before all this without the receipt. That his attitude and comments when I started asking about marriage was to fool me so I didn't get suspicious because this was the plan all along - he wanted an autumn proposal in a beautiful location since it's my favorite season.\n\nMoney he has been saving after moving in with me (since I charge him a much smaller amount than he was previously paying) went to the ring. He saved money for over a year because he knew when he moved in with me that he was going to eventually ask me to marry him.\n\nSo honestly this is the best case scenario! We talked after too. When we get married we will add each other as beneficiaries on our insurance policies. And we decided there's no need to put him on my title even after we get married.\n\nI really appreciate everyone's comments on that last post! I read all of them and most people were genuinely concerned and offered wonderful advice and support.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27675"}

The main incident in my original post wasn\u2019t recorded but all six colleagues wrote a statement confirming what Sarah had said and how inappropriate it was. I didn\u2019t realise but John had also asked others who work with us if they, at any point, heard Sarah attack my character or physical appearance in a cruel or improper manner and if they did, would they be willing to write a statement. Apparently, she has been saying quite a few outrageous things behind my back and it seems that a lot of the hurtful office gossip about me did originate from her. I submitted a few examples of messages and emails, sent by Sarah during work hours, taking jokes about my appearance too far. I also included the messages where I asked her to stop causing attention at work as I\u2019m extremely uncomfortable with others regarding me in that way. Her claims of my bullying her and calling her flat chested and ugly at work were dismissed as she couldn\u2019t specify dates or find anyone to corroborate her story or even provide any examples of me ever being hostile or unprofessional. The phone call we had after the video team meeting where she claims I used threatening language against her was also disregarded as no recording was made and it was her word against mine; Luckily, I don\u2019t think they believed her on this point as I\u2019ve never displayed anything near the type of agressive behaviour she was accusing me of and my character references had me down as the quiet sort who gets on with work. \nWhile things were being reviewed, Sarah decided to quit. She\u2019s still adamant that I bullied and threatened her and felt no choice but to leave the toxic environment I created. I\u2019ve been reassured that there was no wrongdoing on my part except that I should\u2019ve reported things much sooner when inappropriate comments first started. From what I gather, Sarah\u2019s general behaviour at work has raised concerns for a while and I wasn\u2019t the first to complain about her. \n\nSome people were confused as to why I had considered her a friend in the beginning. When I joined the team 3 years ago, it was my first job out of uni and I was incredibly nervous but Sarah was the first to ask me questions and offer to hang out. She was a bit overbearing and rambunctious but I appreciated her efforts to get to know me and coax me out of my shell. We often did have a good laugh despite her sometimes making a joke at my expense but I tried not to take it to heart and occasionally reminded her to wind it in and be more considerate of my feelings. It\u2019s only been during the past 8 or so months where she\u2019s become especially rude and callous. I still referred to her as a friend of sorts but I never thought she would take things as far as she did.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for the kind words, advice and encouragement, it\u2019s really blown me away. I stepped away to talk to John for a while and let him know what a great guy a lot of people think he is. His little smile was adorable.\n\nDespite the misery at work I had to go through for a while, everything has turned out pretty amazing. I do love my job now that I can actually get on with it without the office drama. Finding out how my other coworkers feel about me has been incredibly reassuring and we\u2019ve now set up a weekly virtual pub night. My outlook has improved massively and I\u2019m taking steps to manage my anxieties and put aside past negativity.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27635"}

I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27621"}

My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.\n\nHere we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he \"looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair\". I texted back, \"I'll take it for $4,000\" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.\n\nHere's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, \"well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask.\" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to \"sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam.\" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: \n\nWell this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:\n\nThe guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.\n\nThe dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.\n\nI would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would \"do bad things\" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.\n\nAnd to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27596"}

I have 3 children, the oldest being 16M. For my birthday last week my son went out and bought me this swinging hammock chair that I had been wanting for 2 years and it cost him quite a bit of his saved money (which I fully intend to put back in to his bank account so he can continue saving). He was so excited to see me open this gift and couldnt wait to help me set it up. I told him he shouldnt have, that it was a lot of money and his response was \"You never get anything nice. I wanted you to have it.\" And it was true. I usually dont get anything for my birthday or Christmases outside of Tupperware or soaps. So it might sound stupid but I have cherished this swing ever since he got it for me, especially where I finally have something nice that's mine. \n\nMy SIL comes over once a week to see all of us and she immediately headed straight for my swing (which my son hooked up on our deck). I told her to please not sit on it and she said \"Is there a weight limit?\" So I told her yes, 250lbs and I even showed her the box to confirm. She was not upset about this. She just said \"That's a bummer, they need to make something capable of holding us big girls\". I simply agreed with her and went about my business. At this point my husband shows up from work.\n\nWhen I went inside to grab us some drinks her and my husband are talking on the porch and not even 5 minutes later I hear a loud crash and my husband say \"Fuck, are you alright?\" I go out and sure enough she had sat in my swing and the crochet netting around the hook snapped on one side, causing her to fall right on her ass. She is sitting there laughing, gets up and says \"I guess i need to learn to listen.\" So I lost it. As I said above, I literally never get anything nice. Never. This is the one thing that I had that was mine and it didnt even take someone a freaking week before they ruined it for me. So I said \"I literally just fucking told you not even 20 minutes ago that it would not hold you and to please not fucking sit in it.\" She makes some comment about \"Usually the weight limit is a lie. I thought it would hold.\" So I said \"The weight limit probably would have held if you were only 50lbs heavier than it, not 150.\" (She is 420ish lbs because she is one of those girls who eat food on camera for money and she absolutely loves her weight). But regardless, instead of apologizing or offering to compensate me for my destroyed item, she has resorted to saying I'm a shit bag for making her feel like her weight is a problem and my husband is on her side. \"Its just a fucking swing\".

I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:\n\n* Dairy\n\n* Wheat/Flour/Gluten\n\n* Legumes\n\nSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. \n\nI never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.\n\nI noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.\n\nIt didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.\n\nI was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. \n\nShe has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got \"carb addicted.\" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27567"}

Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom.

It bothered me because I have work commitments (I'm a nurse) and my schedule can unpredictable, and so he caused me issues at work for dropping his kid off at my house without telling me first.\n\n\n\nLast week he did it again, He came over at 6pm and entered my house with my nephew (he had a spare key) while I was showering and left the house immediately. I got out of the shower and was shocked to see my nephew standing there alone. I asked where his dad was and he said he just left. I knew he wanted me to watch my nephew, I called him several times on the phone and he did not pick up. I was so mad and almost freaking out because I was getting late for my shift. I sent him a text telling him to come pick his son up right now or I'd call cops on him for child abandonment. He texted back begging that I suck it up just this time because he had an important date and he couldn't leave in the middle of it. I told him that I was serious and I'd do it and gave him 10 minutes to get home.\n\n\nHe got home looking pissed and started yelling at me for ruining his date and making him leave in the middle of it, just because I couldn't bother skip one damn shift to watch my nephew. I told him I never agreed to watch his son and he made me do it. He said that it was an emergency which made me laugh because calling a date night \"emergency\" is just absurd. Long story short he left with my nephew but hasn't stopped blaming me for spoiling his date and probably causing damage to the relationship between him and his \"potential\" girlfriend.\n\nIt's been a week and he's still salty about it demanding I make it to him and call his date and lie to her and tell her some sob story about why he had to leave like that but I said I won't do that.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27547"}

At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi guys\n\nI thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. \n\nI thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn\u2019t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201cI mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201d\n\n\nI made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201cgift card\u201d on the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like \u201calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201d But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not.

We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.\n\nSo anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n\nI\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. \n\nWhen the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off. \n\nA manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount).

I moved out so she and the kids could stay in our home. I\u2019m staying with my parents for now. I don\u2019t get to see my kids as often as I would like to. When I have a more stable living situation we\u2019ll have joint custody of them. It\u2019s been very hard on me and the kids. I talk to them on the phone every night, and they both keep asking when I\u2019m coming home. It breaks my heart that I can\u2019t answer that question.  My daughter is taking it the worst. I feel awful that her world had been turned upside down by her own parents. I miss my family. I miss seeing my kids everyday. \n\nI miss my wife. \n\nOur relationship has been put in limbo for now. She says she needs space to process, and doesn\u2019t know if she will be able to forgive me. I\u2019ve apologized in every way that I know how to. At this point I just have to give her the space she wants and hope she calms down. It would be horrible for us to throw away we built. If separating has been this hard in the kids, divorce is going to shatter them. She seems open to seeking couples counseling. It gives me some hope we can work past this.\n\nAs for reddit, I admit I didn\u2019t want to hold myself accountable before. I couldn\u2019t see how my actions were subconsciously harmful to my son. It was never my intention to be racist but I did treat my son differently due to his skin color when you strip it down to its roots. I realized how bad I fucked up when I felt ashamed thinking my wife has probably told her family why we separated. They used to think really highly of me. Now they all probably think I\u2019m a racist. I have no one to blame for that but myself.\n\nWith all the craziness going on in the world I know that I need to be more aware of my actions. My kids deserve to have their family to be safe haven from racism. It scares me thinking about the type of world I will send them out into where they could be racially profiled in most places. I can\u2019t imagine if it were my son on the news instead of one of those other poor guys. I\u2019ll never let anything get in the way of my relationship with him again.

I am not close with them) for barbecue parties. He prides himself on his BBQ skills. The thing is... I always end up doing everything! He buys and preps the meat and then grills and serves it (and collects praise for his BBQ skills). I have to buy drinks, get out enough dishes, clean up the patio/deck (non native speaker, idk which one to use). I prepare the sides and veggies, I refill the drinks and take away dishes (we don\u2019t use paper plates or plastic cups since I find it wasteful) so as to keep the main table tidy. It\u2019s just nonstop work for me. \n\n\nHe just told me last week that he invited his friends for Saturday (so yesterday). Just announced it, didn\u2019t ask me. I said well okay, do I know anyone? Nope, those are his work mates and they won\u2019t be bringing their spouses. My husband called it a \u201cguys\u2019 night\u201d. I said okay then, guys\u2019 night, well enjoy yourselves, I will be in my craft room working on some of my projects and drinking wine. He said he will handle it.\n\n\nSpoiler alert, he did not handle it. He got the meat alright, but just ignored any other preparation and I was just so sick and tired of being taken for granted (he never -asks- me for help, I just do stuff...) so I didn\u2019t do anything. The patio was a mess, the upholstery of the garden furniture was all messy from our dogs, the table wasn\u2019t wiped down, there was stuff lying all around. His friends arrived, I welcomed them and then excused myself to my crafts room, put some music on and worked. Cue the messages.\n\n\nHe started asking for stuff, like where are the plates (we only keep a small set in the kitchen, the rest is in the basement), where are the cups, why isn\u2019t the beer chilled, where is the non alcoholic beer - did I not buy it? Where are the sides? I just replied that he said he would handle it all himself.  (EDIT: this is also where I fee I might have been the asshole, it would have taken me just minutes to at least tell him where the stuff is)\n\n\nI checked on the guys a few hours later and it was a disaster. Table all cluttered, they ordered some takeout as sides, there weren\u2019t enough dishes and silverware, someone had to go drive for drinks. \n\n\nOn Sunday (today) he was all grumpy and actually told me that he is disappointed that I didn\u2019t pull my weight and that I made our family look sloppy and bad. I told him that I am not his little housewife and that he is a big guy and if he embarrassed himself in front of his work mates, that\u2019s all on him. And that I\u2019m glad that he can see at least a tiny bit of work that I do around the house. He got upset and went for a run to let off some steam. \n\n\nOh and the patio is full of dishes, he didn\u2019t even clean the grill. I\u2019m not touching anything.\n\nEdit/update: thank you for the comments, this made me realize I am at fault as well - for tolerating this for so long. I went out to clear my head (my husband came back from his run and is pointedly not speaking to me) and reconsider many things in our marriage.\n\nEdit/update2: maybe a similar story was posted before, apparently more husbands are assholes.

She\u2019s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, \u2018Arya\u2019. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.\n\nThe next day, which was yesterday, she said she\u2019s found a way to name her baby \u2018Arya\u2019 and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. \n\nShe asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name. \n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27476"}

My boyfriend has been my rock through all this, I was a mess of tears and anger the first few days and he's the one who got me through it. Im currently staying with him (renting) but we have been looking for our own place together since the lease on the current place runs out soon. I went to my gp and got a mental health plan done up so I should be seeing a therapist soon, free of charge. Its not a huge update but Im doing a lot better in so little time from just cutting them out of my life, Im looking forward to the future.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27466"}

My husband won\u2019t let me sleep. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nOk, so I work 12 to 16 hour shifts at an extremely labor intensive job that requires the use of heavy machinery. My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled. Now my husband is angry and says that it hurts his feelings that I am no longer sleeping next to him every night. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27466"}

OP was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. Their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? And there is a resounding chorus of NTA! You don't owe anyone anything! Or someone was mean to OP, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. AITA?  No! They were rude so you get to be as well! \n\nI dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. Sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. These reactions are understandable. But just because its understandable doesn't mean OP can't be the asshole. \n\nBeing wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. People make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  It is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. \"They started it\" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. \n\nThis sub isn't \"was this person in the wrong to do this to me\" its \"am I the asshole.\"  ESH exists. NAH exists. \"NTA, but you should still apologize/try better next time\" exists. Let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27462"}

For the past month she\u2019s been feeding our baby mashed potatoes, applesauce, sweet tea, assorted fruit juices and other things.\n\nThe last time we went to the doctor, our pediatrician told us to not give her anything but formula until she was between 4-6 months old. My wife does not care and says she knows best for our child and our doctor isn\u2019t the parent. \n\nOur daughter is always constipated and screams for hours at night that my wife says Is \u201ccolic\u201d I\u2019ve asked her numerous times to stop feeding our infant table food and go back to giving her formula. She is only feeding her one or two bottles of formula while I\u2019m at work. \n\nThe other morning she was cooking scrambled eggs and oatmeal and I was off work so I started to make our daughter a bottle and feed her and she stopped me and told me not to fill her up with that and she wanted her to eat her oatmeal first. I fed her the bottle anyway after a huge argument. \n\nWell baby had a doctors appointment and my wife was talking about the colic and screaming fits and when the doctor asked what she was feeding her she only said \u201cformula\u201d nothing else. I was angry because she lied and told her the pediatrician every single thing that she had been giving her and the doctor strongly recommended her to stop and that she was causing stomach upset and more than likely the reason for all her stomach issues. \n\nInstead of being apologetic for this, my wife is mad at me and told me I \u201cratted\u201d her out to the doctor and that she doesn\u2019t have to listen to her and that it\u2019s only a recommendation and that I made her look like a bad parent. I tell her what a selfish little twat she was being and now she wants me to go stay with my parents until she forgives me and asks me to come home. AITA here?

After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore \n\nI looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with \"My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem\" I then responded with \"I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers\" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said \"Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not\", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car \n\nLater when I got home I told my mom about it thinking she would see it as a funny story, boy was I wrong, she started going on about how I was so rude to that lady and that I need to learn to respect my elders\n\nAm I the asshole?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27461"}

Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.\n\nI pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?\n\nEdit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27454"}

Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the \u201ckids room\u201d which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They\u2019ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.\n\nThe other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I\u2019ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.\n\nH\u2019s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I\u2019ve been to their house before, it\u2019s horrible). \n\nAnyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G\u2019s shared one).\n\nI was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.\n\nCue a MASSIVE explosion.\n\nThe baby cannons are pissed that I don\u2019t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he\u2019s a \u201cgrowing boy\u201d and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to take care of kids\u201d.\n\nNone of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn\u2019t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.\n\nCue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can\u2019t stay. At this point, I\u2019m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSo I tell them I\u2019m leaving.\nCue more screaming.\nI drove up my father\u2019s boat, if I leave, there\u2019s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.\n\nI say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we\u2019re leaving.\n\nWell, baby cannons weren\u2019t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I\u2019m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. \n\nAITA here?\n\nUPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27435"}

During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. \n\nAbout 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to \u2018relieve\u2019 it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. \n\nI was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t. My ex\u2019s family treated me like their own, but my ex\u2019s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn\u2019t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. \n\nPeople thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn\u2019t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. \n\nFast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn\u2019t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. \n\nHowever, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn\u2019t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex\u2019s fault. He took a paternity test. \n\nThe poor baby girl was NEVER my ex\u2019s. The coworker apparently was dating this \u2018terrible\u2019 guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn\u2019t know who the child\u2019s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he\u2019d be the best father for her child. \n\nNow my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He\u2019s doing pretty bad now and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty like I should\u2019ve told him.\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. \n\nOkay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I\u2019m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I\u2019ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). \n\nI don\u2019t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn\u2019t after everything that happened between us. They\u2019re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should\u2019ve. \n\nEDIT: So here\u2019s what\u2019s been happening right now, I haven\u2019t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex\u2019s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing \u2018people who were never really family\u2019 over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn\u2019t biologically his, she\u2019s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex\u2018s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won\u2019t contribute to that but he says that he\u2019s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27424"}

It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.\n\nMy bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.\n\nI'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were \"a charity case\". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.\n\nAfter he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?\n\nquick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house.

It's not like that. I get that childcare is expensive, and that often times it just makes sense.\n\nWhat I have a problem with is my teenage daughter literally planning her life to *only* become a SAHM. As in, no college, no jobs, no certifications, nothing at all to support herself until that time might come.\n\nI told her that it doesn't have to be college, that not everyone needs college. But that she needs to do *something* to start making money to put away so that, if anything goes wrong with her plan, she has a way to support herself and the potential kids.\n\nHer feedback was that her backup plan was me and my husband -- she would move in with us and go from there. We would help them survive. I told her then, what happens if we die, or we're incapacitated? She said \"I don't know, Mom, this is ridiculous, none of it is going to happen.\"\n\nI told her bluntly that I don't want her becoming Nancy Botwin 2.0, that if something happens, she *needs* to have a backup plan and something behind her other than relying on other people. I emphasized that again, it *does not need to be college*. She can start working retail to learn customer service skills that she can carry onto doing call center work from home if need be. She can start working as a receptionist somewhere, she can do any number of things. But she says no, she's going to plan to be a SAHM.\n\nWith that all in mind, I asked her, when she graduates high school, what is she going to do? She said \"Just try to find a husband. Maybe marry someone in the military.\" I asked her again, in between that time, how is she going to pay her bills? Her rent?\n\nShe said she assumed she would be living at home.\n\nI told her no, and that she would be moving out. She could live at home if she gets a job or tries to get some kind of community college degree or certification. But that if she insists on being a deadbeat loser and waiting for a man to come and rescue her, she's on her own.\n\nThis didn't go over well, and I am now being held up as totally unreasonable, mean, a huge bitch, etc.\n\nI don't think I'm wrong at all. I want to set her up for a lifetime of success and happiness. If this wonderful man who comes and whisks her away, knocks her up, etc, gets injured or dies, I don't want to have her come knocking at our door because she can't afford to take care of herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n**ETA:** Ohhhh my god, I posted this when I was SUPER agitated and walked away and forgot about it and came back to see all of the responses. Holy shit. Give me a few minutes to catch up. Damn.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27377"}

For blowing up at my husband for lying to me about my sister and her baby leaving when he actually kicked her out? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nMy sister (20) got out of a terrible relationship and moved in with me and my husband and brought her 5 months old son, she's dealing with a handful of issues from ppd to depression. I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.\n\n\nShe stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. He said it causes him stress although I suggested he put on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.\n\nLast week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find her or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd...especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome, and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he admitted he faked the letter an hid her phone then argued that it's his house to and he has a say, but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless. I get that it's house too but I don't see why he's so against her staying.\n\n\nEdit:- he returned home and we started arguing again, I couldn't take it anymore I'm going to stay at a hotel for tonight am I'm leaving in an hour or so. He is wanting to talk again now but I'm incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out and need some time by myself. I don't care if he's going to change the locks or not I'm working on meeting up with my sister as soon as possible so we can talk more openly about what happened and hopefully try and figure something out.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27382"}

It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.\n\nThey started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.\n\nI had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for \"a few weeks\". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.\n\nIt's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.\n\nI'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.\n\nI'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.\n\nI said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I \"popped them out so close together\". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nYesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27344"}

I don\u2019t think what I did was an AH move at all but maybe the timing was a bit off but No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH full stop\n\n\nMy (f27) sister in law (f30) got married last weekend. She\u2019s my long term boyfriend\u2019s (m32) sister. They\u2019re white and I\u2019m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn\u2019t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who\u2019s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over \u20ac 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend. We talked a little and later they met and they started messaging directly to each other. \n\nThe wedding was amazing and everything went smoothly. I was one of the guests and she seemed happy. The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don\u2019t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she\u2019s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I\u2019m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she\u2019s in. \n\nI texted back are you kidding me?\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded with rage when I did it but even now I\u2019m calm I still don\u2019t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this. She\u2019s so beautiful and successful so please don\u2019t blame it on jealousy or scare of being outshined.\n\n#**edit for a little update**\n\n[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwwaaway22/comments/w220ia/update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n1) Sister in law is still on her honeymoon so I haven\u2019t talked to her yet but she\u2019s bombarding my bf demanding that I apologize and make a new insta story with my apology. More people got involved including my Bf\u2019s mother that thought I was way out of line ruining her daughters wedding. I have also got contacted by my sister in law\u2019s friends, some of them told me stories about what she\u2019s been talking about me behind my back. Yeah she got what she deserved. The amount of her friends that weren\u2019t surprised at all with her text made it clear for me that I wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\nMy sister in law is self employed with some foreign customers thats why she\u2019s taking it so hard because she\u2019s scared that would affect her career. I don\u2019t feel like I need to save her career should something bad happen to it.\n\n\n2) My photographer friend did what he was told. Thats the only right way imo. Being professional and not confuse work with his own values. He asked me if I wanted him to say something and I said no. I also asked him not to tell me what they\u2019re texting since she\u2019s his client so he shouldn\u2019t break confidentiality. He\u2019s just starting his career and he will meet worse brides. She was at least nice to him throughout their interaction.\n\n\n3) now to my bf. As I said he thought this whole thing was uncomfortable. I told him if he wanted to be with me he needed to discuss uncomfortable topics. He opened up and it was actually deeper than this. This has happened before. His uncle is very rich and for his 60th birthday he had a very big party. As a thank you we received thank you cards with our pictures on it professionally taken. I remember this picture because his uncle had a \u201cred carpet\u201d moment when guests were photographed upon their arrival. Later we went to my bf\u2019s mother to see the rest of the photos and I wasn\u2019t in any of them. I thought it was funny how I literally evaded being caught on camera. I never mentioned this or even reflected on it and while my bf and his family were looking at the pictures and discussing the evening it was just so normal and no one mentioned something out of the ordinary. Today he told me that I was photoshopped off the pictures. Everyone in his family knew it but me. At the time they just thought the uncle could choose whoever he wanted to have in his pictures and they moved on\n\n-but you all kept it from me \n\n-yes\n\n-so you must\u2019ve thought it was hurtful \n\n-i did, I asked my family not to tell you\n\n-and we continued going to that uncle. Celebrated some Christmases, Easters and vacations with him?\n\n\nSilence\n\n-you didn\u2019t feel offended on my behalf?\n\nSilence \n\n-and now you think it\u2019s okay that your sister is doing the same?\n\n-I didn\u2019t think of it that way I know my sister. She nit a racist.\n\n-if it wasn\u2019t racist why is she feeling \u201cembarrassed\u201d now? \n\nSilence \n\n\n-you think what she did was alright?\n\n\n-of course not!\n\n\n-will you just stand and watch when this happens to our children \n\n\n-OF COURSE NOT.\n\n\nI know my bf very well. He\u2019s very kind and I never felt he was racist in anyway. I know he\u2019s not stupid and is aware of these things which makes it worse because it just means he doesn\u2019t care enough. I asked him why he didn\u2019t care enough and he said he was so sorry but he knows me to be a strong girl that never let these petty things affect her. He\u2019s right, I normally ignore 99% of the racism and micro aggressions I face in life and even laugh at the ignorance. We even discussed this before. But does being strong mean that people are entitled to try to hurt me? Because I usually don\u2019t let them? Does it mean I wouldn\u2019t appreciate to feel the support of my bf having my back? Don\u2019t strong women deserve being supported by their loved ones and feeling safe and loved? He couldn\u2019t answer this.\n\nI told him that I never want his sister in my life again or his uncle and probably not his mother either if she still wants me to apologize. I don\u2019t want to surround myself with people like them and especially when I have children and I asked him if he\u2019s willing to live like that. I asked him not to answer me now and think about it. It kinda felt like an ultimatum and thats bad but I didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation better. \n\nI never thought of myself as someone who\u2019s petty or that makes ultimatums. This experience taught me that I\u2019m both\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\nAnd thank you for the NTA judgment <3\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27340"}

But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.\n\n\nThey fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27323"}

I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.\n\nA few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.\n\nMy future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.\n\nI told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.\n\nI definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?\n\n**EDIT**    \nI did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  \n**Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  \nYes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted. \n\n**Does your fiance have sisters?**  \nNo; he has two younger brothers.\n\n**Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  \nHe did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. \"Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet\".  It was very sweet and cute. \n\n**What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  \nBecause of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life. \n\n**Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  \nThat was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest. \n\n**Your sister is amazing!**  \nShe is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime. \n\n**Please update us**  \nI absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27306"}

My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\n\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\n\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\n\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There's really no chance.\"\n\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\n\nI said \"We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\n\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\n\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\n\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother.\" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\n\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\n\nI hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27250"}

My neighbors (one street over but the back of their house faces the back of the house I live in) can see my whole backyard and vice versa. \n\nMy apartment has a whole wall of windows that are on the back of the house. It's gorgeous and is a big reason I picked the place, I love keeping plants and it let in a lot of light. Looking out, there is the neighbors backyard which is large and comes up close to my place, the property line is maybe 10 or 15 feet from my windows.\n\nOnce it has gotten to be warm out I've noticed the husband of the family who owns that house looking into my apartment a lot. Even sometimes I'll look up and see him, look away then look back minutes later and he's still looking. So I started shutting the shades during the day but that was kind of annoying, my place is a  dark cramped shoebox without the windows open. And I can't do that for too long because the plants were struggling without light\n\nSo I bought these window coverings that make windows into one way mirrors. During the day when it is light out, my windows look just like mirrors now.\n\nFrom the inside it looks pretty much the same, the windows look tinted slightly darker but that's it. From the outside you can't see in at all, it looks exactly like mirrors. The section of windows it's applied to is about 8 feet high and 20 feet wide. \n\nAfter a week of the window coverings being up, both of the parents from the neighbors house came to my door and wanted to talk to me. The wife was complaining about the windows for a lot of reasons... \n\n1. They were ugly\n\n2. It was uncomfortable, especially for the teens and their friends, to have a huge mirror adjacent to the swimming pool. It's at a time that they feel insecure about looks and they have lost interest in hanging out by the pool.\n3. In the afternoon and evening, it was reflecting a lot of extra sunlight into their backyard, they couldn't enjoy eating dinner on the back porch with the sun in their eyes.\n\nI said sorry about the inconvenience but I wanted it for privacy. \n\nThey both pushed back on that some and I said that I needed privacy because of the husband's starting.\n\nHe started denying it in front of his wife and so I took out my phone where I'd taken pictures and sent it to my group of friends, and showed her a couple pictires of him gaping at my apartment and the texts from that time.\n\nHe got mad and said he incidentally looked over, and the 8 foot by 20 foot mirror was a crazy overreaction.\n\nI said that I'd like to keep it, and that I was sorry but frankly this was avoidable. \n\nI think they're both mad because they called my landlord, who brushed them off \n\nAITA for putting the mirrored film on my windows?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27253"}

I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it.

Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.\n\nThey invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.\n\nI honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).\n\nAfter arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.\n\nThis morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.\n\nMy wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Wow, I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the responses and awards! I took the advice of one of the posters here to ask my wife and her sisters to meet me for dinner apart from their parents. It was interesting to say the least.\n\nAfter we sat down, I leaned into them a bit about what had happened. I asked my wife if she knew her dad was going to demand we sleep separately, and she said she was surprised by it as well - she'd expect that if I were still just her boyfriend, but we're married now. I then asked them all if they thought it was OK for their parents to act the way they did. They said it wasn't, but they know their father and it's best to just let things like this go.\n\nThis led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me \"disrespecting him\" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.\n\nI then asked if they thought this was even about house rules, because it seemed more like their dad was just trying to show me who was in charge. They agreed.\n\nUp to this point I had really done everything I could to not escalate this situation, but I started to get really mad that they were all so afraid of how their dad would react. I decided I needed to push back a bit.\n\nI know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents. They know that their dad is probably going to freak out when they leave, but I think they realized this situation had gone too far so they decided they would come and deal with the fallout afterwards.\n\nSo that's where this all stands for now. I'm about to check out of my hotel and hit the road for San Diego. My wife and her sisters are coming down in a separate car after their parents leave for work. I fully expect their dad to throw a conniption fit when he finds out they left without telling him, but I really don't care at this point. I tried to be the bigger person at every turn, but he pushed this all way too far.\n\nThanks again to everyone for all the insight.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27203"}

Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.\n\nI was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  \n\nSo we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.\n\nWhen we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.\n\nI told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.\n\nI told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27197"}

I handle everything related to Adam's school. He has a friend (Dean 14) that he started hanging out with a year ago. Dean is an amazing boy and has been nothing but a great influence for adam. I met Dean's dad (Mike) who's a single dad and we'd see each other daily for school pickup/drop offs. My husband kept asking about Mike and pointed out that he's being boundary stompping but I disagree.\n\nUnfortunately, Adam fell sick months ago and had to undergo a surgery recently. It's been hard but Dean kept visiting, sometimes Mike would come too and my husband would either ignore Mike or make passive comments towards him. Mike picked up on that and I told my husband to knock it off cause his hostility affected Adam and Dean as well.\n\n\nDays ago, I found Adam crying in his room, this was weeks after getting discharged, I asked and he said that Dean sent him a text telling him they were no longer friends and blocked his number. I was confused they were fine. I wanted to go talk to Dean but the next day I found his phone in my husband's car. I confronted him and he said he \"borrowed\" it from Dean but I didn't buy it. After pushing he confessed that he stole Dean's phone at the hospital and sent Adam a text telling him to not contact him again. I asked why and he said it was all Mike's fault for being too close to me and acting inappropriately, and said that he didn't want to directly tell Adam to no longer speak to Dean and chose this stratagy to not make Adam hate him while keeping Dean and by extention Mike away. This hit a nerve so hard I started screaming at him. He said he already expressed how uncomfertable he felt with Mike being around and I kept brushing it off. I said it was because of how ridiculous his argument was, Mike has been nothing but respectable and helpful, I yelled calling him insecure and unreasonable and also cruel for causing Adam heartache with his stunt. He begged I don't tell Adam but I took the phone and returned it to dean and exlained to him and Adam what happened.\n\n\nAdam is no longer speaking to my husband and he is blaming me for telling instead of keeping it between the adults like I'm supposed to.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27191"}

Their mom passed away 5 years ago and I married my wife Rose about a year ago. Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.\n\nWhat she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of \"he wouldn't be I interested anyway\" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.\n\n\nI'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his \"moody personality and introvert nature\" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.\n\n\n1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.\n\n2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.\n\n3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.\n\n4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind \"last minute\" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27189"}

They didn't fill it, but I made a spread on one of the pages that said 'go make new memories' with a picture of her and her fianc\u00e9. I put a lot of work into making it look cute.\n\nI called her and asked to talk. She arrived and we had a long discussion. I asked if she had any trauma, or self esteem issues (in a more tactful way, obviously) and she said no- she simply did not like having her photo taken and adopted the behaviour of screeching and kicking to avoid photos. She did say she had anxiety and that's why she had panic attacks, but that it was mostly because she was gassing herself up (if that makes sense). I knew she had anxiety, but not that she 'gassed herself up', if that makes sense? Btw, 'gassing herself up' are her words, not mine.\n\nRegarding her visit (the one that kicked things off) she explained that she was embarrassed by her behaviour and even more so when it was 'exposed' to her fianc\u00e9. She said she didn't quite realise how much time she had lost and that it was very emotional time for her. I apologised for my wording during our spat and we both made up.\n\nI even showed her the post and we read the comments together. We had quite a laugh at all the armchair psychologists and internet detectives that claimed just because she knew a sexual gesture as a child, she was in danger. Some people were writing borderline fanfiction and re-writing my entire history with my daughter based on one post- that's talent.\n\nAfter a little bit of talking, I brought out the album and gave it to her---\n\nShe was happy, and she seemed to take responsibility over the fact she refused to have pics taken. I told her I had printed out the candid ones from when she was 12-18 and asked if she wanted them. She said no. She really liked the page with her and her fianc\u00e9, which made me super happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's that! You might find this hard to believe, but other than this incident (which we are working through) we have a very good relationship.\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you for all your kind comments and rewards! I'm slowly working through all the comments and replying to as many as I can :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27180"}

I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don\u2019t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. \n\nI used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I\u2019ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don\u2019t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. \n\nFirst night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it\u2019s the little comments when I get into bed. Like \u201care we doing the slave tonight?\u201d Or \u201cshould I help you into bed grandma?\u201d Little things like that. I\u2019ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn\u2019t like it and my hope was that he\u2019d get used to it by now. \n\nLast night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn\u2019t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he\u2019d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn\u2019t tell me where. He wouldn\u2019t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. \n\nHe got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven\u2019t talked much about it but there\u2019s this air of awkwardness.

Now he\u2019s suggesting couples counseling to get through our \u201crace issues\u201d? I don\u2019t think it was that serious and I don\u2019t want to go through all that.

He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a \"puppy package\" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\n\nVT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...\n\nMe: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.\n\nVT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.\n\nMe: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\n\n\\*silence\\*\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...\n\nVT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.\n\nMe: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.\n\nVT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.\n\nMe: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.\n\nVT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.\n\nMe: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?\n\nVT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.\n\nMe: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:\n\n1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.\n2. It amazes me how many of you post things like \"you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this\"... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.\n3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).\n4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.\n5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.\n\nTo maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks?

I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.\n\nI have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of \"just trying to help\", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. \n\nI'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)\n\nKat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to \"let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding\". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.\n\nLiterally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment \"tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering\". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my \"duty\" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was \"blindsided\" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27108"}

If INFO is needed, please ask.\n\nSon is in 4th grade. School is only open on Mondays. The rest of the week he is home with me. They dont do virtual learning during the rest of the week. No zoom calls are made. No teacher actually checks in. Homework at home is not to be sent back to the school and instead they get a participation grade the following week if they tell their teacher they completed it. Its backwards and your students arent being graded for the work they actually do.\n\nEvery monday we get a new flier in the mail asking for donations. Last week we got a flier that said to send out 20 emails to individuals to ask them for donations, with the promise of prizes for participation. They also had other prizes on this flier. Basically, the more people who donate using your name, the bigger the prize you get. \n\nMy son wanted the headphones prize. No where on the flier did it say how many donations was needed. I called the school to ask and they said 12. I sent out the 20 emails. 14 people donated. The donation list was to be emailed to the school with the student ID and we were to pick up the prizes this past Monday. Son was losing his mind excited because he got the 12 donations needed for the headphones. \n\nWe walk in and they proceed to tell me and my son that he did not qualify for the prize because in order to be eligible, you needed to get those 20 donations. Apparently the prizes for donations started counting AFTER you recieved the 20. They turned damn near every student away, not just my kid.\n\nSo I sent the boy out with his father and pulled the teacher and principle aside to let them know that I thought it was fucked up that they got these kids hopes up for absolutely nothing and that all they accomplished was destroying the children's spirits by lying to their faces. I then told them that I was told by the secretary that he only needed 12 donations for those headphones. \n\nThey said \"Sorry you feel that way. This is just how things are right now due to Covid.\" So I responded with \"Oh. So lying to students and breaking their spirits is okay because of Covid? Failing to provide virtual learning for the rest of the week like other schools is okay because of Covid? Asking for donations when the kids are only here once a week must be okay too right?\" I then walked out. \n\nWell, my son got the headphones in the mail today with a note from the superintendent that said \"I'm very sorry for the actions of the school system and the confusion formed around the donation drive. We are trying to work with the families, not turn them away. Please accept this as an apology.\" \n\nMy son is over the moon. My husband says that I was being a Karen and that we should have just dropped it because it teaches our son that life isnt fair and that I now look like an AH helicopter parent.\n\nAITA?

This is one of my two jobs to put myself through college. Most days are fine but other days are a living hell.\n\nYesterday I was assigned a table that had a husband, wife and what appeared to be a teenage daughter (maybe 17). Everything was going smooth at first and the wife ordered a margarita. The husband then tried ordering a beer. The wife instantly lost her noodles and said \"Uh, no. He will not have a beer. He will have a water.\" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive. It was childish.\n\nAnyways, he keeps telling me he wants a beer. She keeps telling me no. In this industry, situations like this are a lose/lose for waitresses. If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said \"Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here.\" They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.\n\nFlash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. \n\nWife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said \"She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night.\" She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it wasnt MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.\n\nGiven the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27063"}

When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.\n\nThe whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a \"super duper cool girl\".\n\nAnyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)\n\nThe final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.\n\nthe SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.\n\nMy daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying \"why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??\". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.\n\nMy daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:\n\nD \"hey its me\"\n\nSB \"thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha\"\n\nD \"what\"\n\nSB: \"arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts\"\n\nSB \"slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool\"\n\nD \"u dont like the party..?\"\n\nSB \"I jus wish i could go home looool\"\n\n\\~end\n\nIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).\n\nI took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said \"because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go.\" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.\n\nI talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said \"its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.\"\n\nI thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.\n\nMy wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27025"}

Eversince, he's been complaining about his mom barging in without knocking and interrupting his sleep and studying. Sometimes when he's changing...I know that she's his mother but he says he's got his own room and has a job and is learning to become an independent adult but\ndoesn't feel like his privacy is being respected even when that's his mom. He says he's not a kid anymore and is entitled to at least get a knock on the door before she comes in.\n\nHe was getting tired of her not listening to him \nSo he came to me and said ...dad, you need to help me set some clear boundaries with mom. So I spoke to her about her need to knock before entering Simon's room. She was like what? And no, we're family, not strangers...do you really expect me to foolishly knock on the door 5 times a day?...that's ridiculous!!! Also the...\"who knocks doors in their own home?\". I told her my family for instance.\nShe made a face then went on a rant about how my family hate each others and the way they treat each others like they were strangers is shameful.\nI told her family or strangers it's about respecting one's privacy. We had an argument about it and\nI told her if she wasn't going to stop with the barging and refuse to knock on the door before entering then our son will get a lock.\n\nShe did it again at 11pm, she barged in when our son was asleep he jumped up because he got scared.\nOnce he told me this I told him to go ahead and get a lock and pay for it with his own money, there was literally no other way.\n\nMy wife saw it and got upset and my brother was visiting when she was raising her voice at me\nquestioning if *I* really went ahead and got a lock for Simon despite her disapproval and said that I caught her off guard and it's not okay because this teaches our children that they can 'manipulate' one parent into doing what they want. I told her that A. Simon got the lock not me and B. I already warned her about the possibility of him getting a lock because he was getting tired of her boundary crossing. So she should've expected this outcome.\n\nShe mentioned the same above points in her defense and said locks means secrets and that's not good. My brother was sitting watching while she was complaining, She began chewing him out when he asked her to let simon keep the lock and said it wasn't a big deal.\nShe stopped talking to me and Simon til we remove the lock but I've no intentions on doing that.\n\nWas I at fault for my stance?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 27008"}

He's a great kid, but losing our parents made him a quiet, sad young boy. I've tried to encourage him to attend therapy so he can work on his grief, but he has refused every single time telling me that he's not ready yet. I get it, everyone works at their own peace and as longs as he's not deliberately hurting himself, I won't pressure him. I try to be as involve in his life as I can be without it being overwhelming, we both enjoy movie nights or binge watch shows on the weekends and he also helps my husband with his old car.\n\nBefore our parents passing my brother had a gf (16), she seemed like a good kid too, but after the funeral my brother decided that being in a relationship wasn't what he needed at that time and broke up with her. Totally valid. But she didn't take it good and was sure that my brother only needed ''some love'' to heal.\n\nLast month she began to drop letters and gifts to our door and my brother refused to open them every single time, she used to message and call him too and I could see the distress on my brother's face. The worst thing happened last friday, it was my brother's birthday and my husband and I decided to take him out, when we got back he went to his room and as soon as he did it, eh came down running.\n\nNow, his ex found her own way into my house, arranged his room with photos of him with her, their friends and our family, put some balloons and was waiting for him with a cake, mind you, this is creepy as fuck, so while my husband entertained her I called the police and they took her for trespassing private property. My brother is thankful, but my husband and the kid's parents are sure I'm overreacting and that I should drop the charges because she's trying to do something nice.\n\n**Little update: I just talked to my brother and we agreed on getting a restraining order no matter what, he'll be switching rooms since he told me that he can't sleep there anymore, our guest room is a bit smaller bus he says that he doesn't care!

My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26986"}

We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.\n\nEdit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.\n\nVisibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.\n\nMy mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.\n\nThen a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.\n\nLast week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.\n\nIt's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her \"special little guy\" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.\n\nI feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I DO NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS TO BE TURNED INTO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26977"}

When SIL was pregnant I made it clear that I\u2019d only babysit for them in the case of a serious emergency, e.g. someone has a medical emergency. I won\u2019t babysit if they just wanted time off from being parents, because I don\u2019t have the free time for that. I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it\u2019s me. \n\nLast year, my brother and SIL asked me to babysit on the day of an informal work meeting, a lake retreat organized by my company. Everyone is expected to go, and it\u2019s frowned upon if you miss it. They wanted to go on a date. I said no, I have an important work event. They continued to nag me about how they haven\u2019t gone on a date for so long. \n\nThe night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city over had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they\u2019d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike\u2019s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again. Throughout the next two months, my brother and SIL regularly used the excuse of aiding Mike in his recovery and needing to visit him in order to make me babysit my nephew.\n\nMike\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s company and my company had a meeting two months after Mike\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d. I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike\u2019s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I \u201cgave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie\u201d. \n\nI made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I\u2019ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL\u2019s family. They even sent me proof of the relative\u2019s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn\u2019t care about betraying my trust, so I don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital. They said I was a bad aunt, needed to get over my grudge, and a petty asshole. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26924"}

It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  \n\nI have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  \n\nWe are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. \n\nMy now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quincea\u00f1era.  \n\nSo here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. \n\nWhen we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  \n\nMy mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  \n\nWhen she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  \n\nThe ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. \n\nThe problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  \n\nShe said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  \n\nMy idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  \n\nI came clean and told her about the \"special\" invitation.  \n\nShe is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  \n\nAITA,?\n\nEdit\n\nPart of the reason she is mad is because she had her invitation framed.  To be honest I was already planning a heist with my sisters to replace it with the real one in case she ever noticed the discrepancy between hers and the one we have framed in our home.\n\nEdit number two. \n\nYeah we are Latinos.  And no I do not in any way consider it racist how many of you guessed that.  I have been to Spain and it's an issue there too.  And the Philippines. Basically anywhere those guys were in charge.\n\nEdit three.  \n\nStop defending John. He and I have spent thirty years messing with each other.

They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages. \n\nSo dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy. \n\nPops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents.\n\nFor a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me \"My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner\" I said sure. I'll tell my family. \n\nSo yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says \"Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready\". She says \"You must be \\_\\_\\_\\_ dad so good to meet you\" and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen \"He's holding the mac n cheese tray\" with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says \"Who's he?\" i said, \"Oh that's my dad\". She said \"I though he's your dad\" she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says \"I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nI genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents \"let's leave\" and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said \"son don't worry this is nothing new haha\" and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep. \n\nSo AITA for not telling?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26919"}

He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top.

She says it's distracting. The comments about the appearance of the chair annoy me a lot because it's hardly going to look brand new after 7 years of constant use.\n\nShe made a comment this morning along the lines of \"You know, you should really get a new one, that one looks like it's about to collapse under you\". I got really mad about this and I said, \"You know what, if you think I should get a new chair so bad, you can pay the nearly 4 grand it's gonna cost or you can stop making nasty comments about something that literally doesn't affect you.\" \n\nShe didn't really look at me until the end of the class but the boy who sits besides me said it was slightly assholeish as she probably didn't realise how difficult the process was.

Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \n\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn\u2019t I tell her earlier and she\u2019s so proud of me\n\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\n\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\n\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn\u2019t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \n\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\n\n> I\u2019m sorry for how I reacted; please don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It\u2019s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you\u2019re going to be where I wanted to be and I\u2019m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ranting I just need more time\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\u2019re best friends and I just don\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\n\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \n\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\n\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\n\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26894"}

It's unfortunate but life goes on no matter what happens\n\nMy family knows how much I struggle as a single dad and my sister doesn't really get it. She had issues with my late wife in the past but now started \"helping\" with my daughter. She re-decorated my daughter's room without my consent, she'd insist I let my daughter go spend days at her house but my daughter is comfortable at her home. She then started calling my daughter with another name and I'm still trying to understand her logic behind this. I told her to stop doing those things and to be respectful and supportive and she defended herself saying I'm lashing out of grief.\n\n\nI recently. started teaching my daughter to do stuff on her own like brush her hair/clean her room/wash her cups/make sandwiches while I take care of bigger stuff. My sister said that what I'm doing is wrong. That I'm giving her more than she can handle. She's just a kid and although I told her I'm teaching my daughter to be more independent she said that I'm clearly doing this for my own benefits and avoiding responsibility.\n\nI got into a fight with her about it. Told her she has zero say in this. And the next day. A CPS Officer came to my house and took a tour around the house\nMy first thought was \"maybe he got the wrong house\" until he started reading the report to me saying that I'm never home and that I make my daughter do things that aren't her responsibility, neglecting her education  (btw she's homeschooled) and that I'm not taking care of basic hygiene and whatnot. I told the officer my story and explained that I'm adapting as a single parent and he proceeded to aske my daughter some questions.\n\nIt was clearly a false report. However I was told that I will have a permanent record with CPS. and I was shaken up by this. I told my family about it and my younger sister told me that my sister was the one who called CPS after we had a big argument. I was so mad I confronted her after she hid herself. Called her immature and stupid to pull this crap (she's in her 40s) and that she's no longer my sister. Then cut contact. It's been months and now my dad started bringing her up knowing how uncomfortable I was. He said that my sister feels sorry for what she did and wanted to talk things out on Christmas dinner.But I said no. He and the others insisted saying that I should be the bigger person. the family will be incomplete without me and my daughter on Christmas. Saying I refuse to be a \"civil adult\" to solve the issue that is dividing the family. I yelled and said that my daughter and I don't have to go after what she did, doesn't matter if she has issues on her own and didn't \"mean it\" and was just concerned. wtf was she so concerned about? They demanded that I at least let my daughter go be with them >>and her auntie << on Christmas.\n\nEdit: I don't want my daughter to go and I plan on going to my in-laws instead. I want to talk to her about it and see what she wants to do.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26888"}

I had been super chill throughout the whole wedding planning, and during the actual event.  Because I know sh\\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.\n\nWell, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?

My mom is still very much in the cult. As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she\u2019d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn\u2019t often.\n\nShe\u2019s visiting right now. I don\u2019t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It\u2019s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He\u2019s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. \n\nNot long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she\u2019s given her opinion on it. Why don\u2019t I cut it? Don\u2019t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he\u2019s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn\u2019t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I\u2019m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he\u2019s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes \u201cgirl,\u201d that\u2019s on them and a simple \u201che\u2019s a boy\u201d corrects it. But mostly it\u2019s because I don\u2019t fucking want to. \n\nShe got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: \u201cWell I just don\u2019t like long hair on boys.\u201d Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that\u2019s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. \nI said the first thing which came to my head, which was: \u201cIf you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.\u201d\n\nBruh. If looks could kill, I\u2019d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn\u2019t say anything else. She hasn\u2019t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don\u2019t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won\u2019t bring it up anymore. \n\nI feel like we\u2019re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don\u2019t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.\n\nUpdate: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn\u2019t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I\u2019m glad I could make so many of you laugh.

When he got my mother pregnant he wanted her to quit her job and just stay home to \"be a good little wife and mother.  He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  \n\nSo the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). \nHis family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. \n\nWhen they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.\n\nSo long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  \n\nHe is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  \n\nHe has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  \n\nI don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  \n\nBut I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. \n\nI'm not giving it back. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to answer some common questions. \n\n1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. \n\n2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. \n\n3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. \n\n4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.\n\n5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.\n\nEdit n\u00famero dos.\n\nI just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her \"friend\" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.\n\nEdit tres\n\nMy half brother has posted about this. He has a slightly different viewpoint than myself.  He is not in any way coming after myself or my mother. If you comment there keep in mind he is a young man who is disillusioned with his father.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26810"}

Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.\n\nNow the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. \n\nThe field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. \n\nI also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.\n\nWell this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said \"Oh we figured it was a public pool\", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.\n\nThat was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.\n\nWell now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kids\n\nI honestly feel pretty terrible, but I also feel like I gave them plenty of warnings before taking drastic actions.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26806"}

I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n\nI told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n\nIn all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. \n\nShe's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n\nHad another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n\nEDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. \n\nAlso, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n\nRegarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n\nAnd for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. \n\nRegarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n\nLast but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26788"}

Everytime I tried to say no he be like \"I have to join or you'll have to cancel\". It made me & the girls miserable having to sit there with him in the middle.\n\nThis past friday he insisted to join us again, I had enough I came up with an idea to get him to hate hanging out with us, made a plan and told the girls what we were going to do and they were down for ot.\n\n\nThe girls came and my boyfriend immediately sat with us and started ruining our conversations by steering them towards him/his work/his achievement. So here's what I did, I started bringing up gross/ embarrassing subjects and the girls were eating them up by talking about them in details. Subjects like sevx, periods (his most sensitive spot), cramp diarrhea, hairy legs, fart getting trapped in the valva and coming out the front. Squeezing shit out of our faces, cramp diarrhea, dirty underware, and again...cramp diarrhea.\n\nWe talked about this stuff in boring details, like...I could feel his discomfert without even looking at him. But God when I turned to see why he got quiet suddenly. he was getting red in the face, and had sweat all over his forehead, I bet he found himself unable to relate to thise subject thus couldn't take part in the conversation.\n\n\nHe got up from the couch ready to head out, I looked at him and asked where he was going and he was like \"I just ah...I just remembered that I have an important meeting with a guy in about 10 minutes and....ah...I have to go now\" he rushed out telling us to have fun. The girls and I started laughing hysterically.\n\n\nhe came home and berated me saying I made him feel uncomfortable/sick with the horrible subjects I kept bringing. I said \"what u talking about? This is the typical stuff girls talk about all the time\" but he insisted I made him upset and caused him to leave. He declined to speak to me and been quiet since then.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n**UPDATW** Y'all wow, just got home and left this post at 70ish comments, and here I am looking at hundreds of comments but only read a bunch, you guys...thank you so much for your feed back and enlightening advice. Just to add context: this is his apartment, he tells me who is and isn't allowed to come and I thought this was fine since it's his place (though I help with the bills, but he makes so much more as the head of security in his company so that's that) I just can't believe how dense and blind I been to his negative ways. He's still giving me the silent treatment and I've decided it's just a lot to take, and so I'm temporarily moving in with one of the girls and will now be definately reconsidering few things.\n\nJust wanted to keep you guys updated since many of you got engaged in this post, thank you so much for those DMing me their concerns, appreciate your time and concerns. Many hugs go out to you guys, I really appreciate y'all! :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26786"}

During that week, my BF never reached out to me (even if to check if we arrived safely or to ask about our son) and that was the answer I needed. End of the week I texted him to ask if I could pick my things from his place.\nI told him things weren\u2019t working out as he clearly didn\u2019t care about me and we weren\u2019t a priority to him. He said he didn\u2019t see what he had done wrong which is why he had kept quiet and didn\u2019t reach out. \n\nHe said by me moving out, I was taking his son away from him; yet he spent 3/4 of his free time out of the house in the \u2018sauna\u2019(3-4hrs on a weekday after work and 8hrs on the weekend; EVERYDAY)\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t see the point of coming home to baby sit a 4 month old who needed his mother more. All I wanted was for him to come home after work on some days and take care of the baby while I shower in peace or eat food. \n\nHe said it\u2019s clear I wasn\u2019t ready to have a child because he knows women who work 9-5 jobs and still come home to cook and take care of the kids. Implying that I\u2019m failing because I need a break for an hour? \n\nHe said we could reverse roles and he wouldn\u2019t complain at all. When I told him he should be bonding with the baby, he said he\u2019ll take over when he\u2019s a toddler and easier to handle and that kids can be bribed with money and trips and they\u2019ll be your best friend. \n\nI did not make the decision to end this just because of this issue; it was a combination of all red flags. But to be honest, this was the last straw. I was running on fumes, exhausted physically and mentally and I was asking him to help me but he decided, without talking to me about it, that I didn\u2019t need a break. \n\nI believe He wants to live his life as a single man but enjoy the benefits of a relationship (sex, companionship, good housekeeping and food) when he comes home; that\u2019s not how a relationship works. \n\nFor a while he made me feel like what I was asking for was too much. And that I was crazy for asking for a little consideration. Like I wasn\u2019t worth fighting for. I felt it was wrong and talking to you guys here on reddit strengthened my resolve. \n\nWe are now officially ex\u2019s and to be honest, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a loss. I only feel stupid that I chose this person and I\u2019m tied to him for the rest of my life and now my child is the one that suffers from my choice and not having a good father around him everyday.\n\nThank you everyone for your encouraging comments and messages. You made me feel much better about everything and like I wasn\u2019t alone; y\u2019all are awesome! xoxoxo\n\nEdit; the comments were unlocked a while after the post was appoved.

My dad died when I was 5, driving me to the hospital (Mom didn't want to pay for an ambulance). He died in the crash and my leg and spine got busted up in a way that has left me needing a cane pretty much ever since.\n\nMy step-dad's always been a little distant with me, he likes to make jokes about how I'm an 'early blooming black widow'. I think he gets that from my mom, who blames me for my dad's death. I do to, it *is* my fault after all, so I don't push back on it. Anyway, the point is that with the current situation my parents are always looking for ways to get my half siblings active and doing things without leaving the house, and have recently settled on scavenger hunts.\n\nI have no problem with this honestly. I wish they'd stop hiding stuff in my underwear drawer, but it's a 5 y0 and a 7 yo so that's not the worst. My *problem* though is that they keep taking my cane when I'm not looking (I tend to get lost in my homework and my writing hobby and zone out) and having it be one of the items that my half siblings have to find. When I complain to my step-dad (he's a SAHD so is usually the one running these things) he scolds me for being selfish and points out that my swivel chair has wheels if I need the bathroom and that they always get it to me before I have to go downstairs for dinner.\n\nI tried my mom yesterday, and she said that I was being a brat and that if I wanted a father who cared about me I shouldn't have killed my dad. I got really upset at that point and called my grandparents (my mom's parents, Dad's are dead too). They showed up at 10 PM yesterday, and Grandma screamed at them while Grandpa packed my stuff up and helped me out to their car.\n\nMy mom's been blowing up my phone and email, calling me all sorts of names and accusing me of turning her family against her and trying to get her in legal trouble since minors can't move out. And I can't help but think that maybe she's right so...AITA?\n\nEDIT: I would just like to say thank you to everyone who's taken the time to comment and try to reassure me that I'm not the asshole. I can't reply to all of you, I lack the energy and I have homework, but I'm reading them all and I really appreciate it! You've...given me a lot to think about, and I do thank you.\n\nEDIT 2: I Uhm...Wow. that's...that's a lot of support, and a lot of messages. Too many for me to reply to, I'm sorry. Thank you all so much. I promise that I do care what all of you have to say, and I'm reading every chat, comment, and PM. I was so scared this wasn't going to go my way, so thank you, thank all of you.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26769"}

She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.\n\nI spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). \n\nOn her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. \n\nI was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. \n\nI got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. \n\nShe got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty.

She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0\n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0\n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a \"buddy.\" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.\n\nUPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!\n\nSecond, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26766"}

He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high.

I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees.

I\u2019m actually subletting and I\u2019m on my 2nd year which is month-to-month, but we\u2019ve had an unofficial \u201cverbal\u201d agreement that I\u2019d stay until the end of the year. I mean it\u2019s a pandemic, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d move either. \n\nAnyways his gf moved in beginning of this year. It\u2019s been...a lot. She\u2019s obviously had some trauma in the past. I didn\u2019t dig but I believe she was the victim of a home robbery a few years back.\n\nWell when she first moved in my roommate had some \u201cground rules\u201d for me so his gf would be more comfortable. She obviously wasn\u2019t thrilled about having another roommate.\n\nHe said I couldn\u2019t talk to her (like strike up a convo) if he wasn\u2019t there because she doesn\u2019t want to have to talk to me if she didn\u2019t have to. He also said it would be best if we tried to not use the same facilities at the same time (like if she\u2019s cooking in the kitchen, I should wait until she leaves before I grab food, etc.) Like yes it\u2019s strange but I figured it\u2019s his place so whatever. I\u2019m not trying to befriend her either.\n\nThings got worse in recent months cause we\u2019ve all been working from home. It\u2019s REALLY hard to avoid someone 24/7. So obviously I\u2019ve slipped up more. One time I came home from Costco and offered her a spare bottle of coconut water I couldn\u2019t fit in the fridge. Big mistake. My roommate had to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me that night about how I should know she would never drink my drinks and it\u2019s weird for me to even offer. \n\nThe most recent one was when she was watching some GoT in our living room. I just absentmindedly watched a bit standing behind the couch. I laughed at a scene which startled her when she looked up and saw me standing behind her. I got another earful from my roommate about how I needed to stop \u201ccreeping\u201d on her now that I\u2019m home all the time. \n\nLong story short, my friend just had a place open up that\u2019s cheap and I\u2019m gonna move. I told my roommate and he\u2019s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he\u2019s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn\u2019t gonna move. But I\u2019m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. However, I feel kind of guilty because I agreed to their weird rules before all this started back when I thought it\u2019d be ok.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26743"}

She\u2019s in-fact kinda a hermit for her age. \n\nUnknown to me my husband set the hot water heater to refill only once a day while we are gone. Annie did some dishes and laundry. She took a shower and the water was cold. She was upset and thought it broke and called us panicking. \n\nMy husband yelled into her for wasting our hot water and telling her how irresponsible she was enough to make her cry. \n\nI got madder than I ever have in this marriage and basically said most parents would love to have a 17 year old like Annie. We argued and screamed all night so next day I left the resort to a little hotel down the street. My husband as been trying to call me and I told Annie to block her father and don\u2019t pay attention to him.\n\nMy husband is mad about the wasted money on this vacation but I can\u2019t stand to even look at him over an argument over something so stupid and preventable.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26731"}

My son is obssessed with automobile and loves motorcycles. In his room he has plenty of models and posters of motorcylces of all types. His bio dad passed away when he was just 12, now I'm married to my current husband and he has kids of his own.\n\n\nMy husband has always been against my son's interest in motorcycles. he thinks I'm encouraging him to be reckless, distracting him from school and by extension his future, and spoiling him and blowing away money by spending 7k on a motorcycle. This caused some tension between him and my son so I told him to stop complaining about it.\n\n\nAround 2 weeks ago, my son's motorcycle went missing. We opened a police report but nothing came out of it. it just disappeared. My husband had a smirk on his face the entire time just walking around saying \"I told you so!, you just wasted your money!\". This was unbbearablr to hear to be quite honest.\n\n\nMy mother inlaw visited few days ago. She was talking about the other house my husband owns and mentioned seeing a motorcycle, one that's similar to the one that we lost in my husband's carage while she was cleaning it (she goes to clean that house weekly even though it's empty, my husband plans on giving it to his kids as inheritance). I was puzzled I asked if she was certain but she showed me a photo she took of it which confirmed that it was indeed my son's motorcycle. I immedietly rushed to call my husband and confront him about it. He admitted that he took and hid the motorcycle in his garage as a last resort after me and his stepson kept brushing him and his thoughts off about the 7k being spent on something unnecesary and that could cause issues.\n\nI blew up at him demanding he return it, he refused and told me he had been considering selling it and giving the money back to me so \"I could use it wisely this time\". I told him I was serious and that I'd call the police. He literally said \"this is a family matter and cops can't do shit about it\". I had enough I called the cops soon as I ended the call with him.\n\n\nThe motorcycle was found and returned, but my husband had to be taken in since there was an open file about the motorcylce going missing. he was let go eventually but he was livid with me. He came home yelling about how awful what I did was and how crazy my behavior was. I refused to engage in the argument but he told his entire family about it and they judged me for calling the police on my own husband even though I already asked him to return it. he said he was just looking out for my son and that one day we'll realize that he was right but only when it's too late.\n\nMy son isn't spsaking to me or my husband. I feel horrible about the whole situation and am starting to think I handled this the wrong way.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26699"}

We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. \n\nNot to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. \n\nHe ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't \"deal\" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. \n\nI have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce \"problems\" and that he couldn't handle raising a \"r******\" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. \n\nI was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action. I made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. I'm now getting calls and messages for \"making a private issue public\" and \"parental alienation\". AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26689"}

I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noped out of there fast as I could.

I am infertile and knew I couldn't have kids so when N said she was giving her baby for adoption, I decided to be her mom. N went no contact 5 months after giving birth. For a bit of background, N got pregnant by a one night stand and she apparently didn't remember or know the father at the time of birth but when V was 2, a man T (35) messaged me on social media claiming to be the father of my child. N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life. I got too emotional and hung up. T came home from work and on explaining to him, he was beyond furious. I then got a call from my parents saying I was an asshole for telling N she couldn't she her baby. I said I never said that and I welcomed her to bond with V but they refused to listen and said I was being insensitive and harsh and flaunting my family.\n\nI now feel bad because me and N were very close as sisters and I feel quite close to her situation since I know the struggles of infertility. T said there was no way he was letting my sister have full time and I agree but I want to know if am the asshole for being too harsh and telling her about T.\n\nEdit - I did legally adopt V at birth. T adopted her too after we got married. N never wanted kids and I feel the only reason she wants V now is because her husband wants kids. I don't know but I think this is it and T agrees.\n\nEdit 2 - For all the people wandering why I said we were close, I  meant growing up.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26669"}

My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like \"I prefer pink over blue\" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm \"emotionally stronger\" than her. \n\nMy parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. \n\nI was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. \n\nMy sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has \"Euthyrox\" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. \n\nShe's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.\n\nI'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. \n\nMy parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic \"I should apologise since I'm more mature\". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. \n\nI ask them \"so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?\" \n\nNow they're mad at me too.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26662"}

Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.\n\nIn sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.\n\nMom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.\n\nBoy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.\n\nI broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.\n\nI said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.\n\neverything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.\n\nmoms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.\n\nDid I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.\n\nI've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.\n\n3000 char limit is an AH\n\n\nEDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.\n\nedit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.\n\n\nEDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.\n\n\nEDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all right\n\nedit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26635"}

{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: Neither-Meet \nMedia: text \nTitle: AITA for having security at my mother's funeral, having certain people barred entry? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nMy parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.\n\nMy mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.\n\nLong story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.\n\nWas I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).\n\nedit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?\n\nThere's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.\n\nLike one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.\n\nThis is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. \n\nMuch of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not \"trying harder\" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26606"}

I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. \n\nI (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It\u2019s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it\u2019s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We\u2019ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It\u2019s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn\u2019t impact how I see him. \n\nMark is single after a breakup right now and I\u2019ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah\u2019s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was \u201cmaking eyes\u201d at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We\u2019re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.\n\nI have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark\u2019s house too and I won\u2019t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn\u2019t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn\u2019t feel like a joke. I told her \u201cif you seriously can\u2019t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you\u2019re not welcome here anymore. You\u2019re 30, act like it. Get out.\u201d\n\nHannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I\u2019m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.\n\nUpdate: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.\n\nUpdate 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.\n\nFinal update: love who you love!

And let me say my GF now understands why I wanted to wait until Sparky had died before getting a dog.\n\nWithin the six hours that we had the dog, Sparky had tried to bite him on the leg, I pulled him away before he could even make contact with him and hauled Sparky's ass upstairs away from the dog after that moment. While Upstairs Sparky did nothing but yowl at us and revenge pee on the bed, before hiding on top of the wardrobe. While all this was happening my friend's dog just lay there on the floor of the lounge doing absolutely nothing.\n\nUpon seeing what Sparky was willing to do to a dog that wouldn't even hurt a fly, my GF has now agreed that if she wants a dog then it has to be an outdoor dog (which she does not want) or to wait until the awful day that Sparky is no longer with us. Grumpus is very happy with that plan.\n\nGrumpus (Sparky) is now going to spend his golden years lying in front of the fire, watching tennis and Blue Planet on tv, eating lots of treats and sitting on the landing windowsill, where he loves to watch the whole world go by, while casually growling at any dog he sees walk past the house. And he very happy with this plan.\n\nI promise my friends dog was not hurt. I don't even think that he realised that my cat was planning on attacking him. And Sparky is as happy as a lamb again.

I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. \n\nI figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. \n\nI drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. \n\nMy wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as \"the one who wore a dress\" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. \n\nAt the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it.

They had been on the list for a while and getting nowhere. Lots of us got tested and I was a match. We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.\n\nA week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.\n\nI immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery. We got on with our lives, partner found a new job and attended the court date where the case was thrown out 6 months later. \n\nA week after the case was dismissed, we got word boss had died. No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.\n\nI feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. \n\nBosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss. That I should have given the liver anyway and been a good person. \n\nI feel I should have given it, but who bites the hand that feeds? I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented. I'm conflicted and losing sleep over this. \n\nAITA for not giving my liver to the person accusing partner of theft and them later dying?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the positive and informative feedback. I think seeing the outside, impartial view on this has helped me put it in perspective. I've only been focusing on my selfishness causing his death, as opposed to his actions contributing too. I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.\n\nEdit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. \nClearing up a few things\n- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. \n- it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.\n- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us; they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.\n- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.\n- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated....\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26570"}

It\u2019s super unkempt so I\u2019ve been doing lots of yard work outside in the mornings. I\u2019m out there watering the grass in the mornings and evenings. Every single time I\u2019ve done this the neighbor right next door who\u2019s like this older granny comes out to her porch and straight up watches me without even hiding it. I introduced myself to her once that me and my sister are the new owners after my dad passed but it was obvious she didn\u2019t wanna talk. \n\nNext thing she started coming outside with her *phone* pointing the camera right at me. I\u2019m like \u201c is there a problem?\u201d She says there\u2019s no problem as long as I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m supposed to. I asked her why is she recording me then. Neighbor lady goes what\u2019s the problem with me recording if you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. It\u2019s so fucking weird I didn\u2019t even know how to respond to the situation. \n\nSoon as I finished up to go back inside she went back to her house too. This happens every. single. day I\u2019m outside watering the grass. Always the same excuse that she wants to make sure I\u2019m not doing anything else or if I do it\u2019s on camera. So yesterday I got fed up and decided to do something different. When she came out with her phone I stuck my ass out and put my hand on my hip looking right at her. \n\nAt first she was like wtf but then she got really mad when I started wetting myself with the water hose an touching my neck while literally looking directly at her. Was it stupid? \n\nYes but she put her phone away and started cussing me out for being a pervert. My sister told me later on that she came to the house when I was at work talking about me sexually harassing her making poses in provocative ways. My sister knows she\u2019s a pain in the ass since she probably has nothing better to do with her time. \n\nBut I still shouldn\u2019t have stooped to her level making her uncomfortable right back. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m right on this one and it wasn\u2019t even that bad (not like i was grabbing my balls or anything) but also can be a dumbass sometimes so idk you guys tell me.

I was by no means unloved. But it was blatantly obvious who they cared about more. I worked a part time job to get my first car, but my brother got one as a present. It wasn't new, but was much newer than my car. It was the same with just about anything else, like clothes, video games and cell phones.\n\nI'm 18 and am taking a gap year before community college to work a full time job and save money for tuition. But a while back I heard my parents talking about how much they were going to pay for my brother's tuition. I secretly recorded the conversation from around the corner and then came out asking my parents why they were gonna pay for my brother's college, but not mine. They didn't notice my phone was recording and just said that my brother needs more help. I asked how so when I wasn't getting any sort of scholarship, and he likely wouldn't either. Then I asked a few more questions about why things have always been this way. They got mad and my father told me that perhaps it's time I moved out because they are sick of keeping a roof over my head. I pointed out I pay rent. But they didn't care.\n\nI left the room and in a fit of rage uploaded the video to two different social medias I have and ranted about how this is how my parents have always been. Well a few hours my parents were pounding at my door. My dad was screaming at me about how I made them look bad. We fought some more and they left the room fuming.\n\nMy grandparents contacted me later and said they were appalled, then came to visit with a lot of the family the next day. There was a huge family intervention and my parents were made to sit on the couch and look at their feet while being told off. It was then I found out they'd been receiving money for years from my grandparents to help with family expenses. My brother looked like he didn't know what to do. So he sided with the rest of the family and said he's noticed how I'm treated as well. My parents gave me a huge apology that sounded forced.\n\nMy grandparents have offered that I come live with them soon and will cut off the monthly payments to my parents, my father told me I should have never told the rest of the family and now won't talk to me, and my mother has been crying for days.

We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.\n\nI made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are \"boycotting\" my party and hosting their own party.

After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. \n\n\n\nMy father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. \n\nMy mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. \n\nShe was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. \n\nMy mother was devastated and stopped eating properly.\n\n\n In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. \n\nAll this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. \n\nDuring her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. \n\nWhen he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) \n\nMy mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.\n\nI believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time.\n \n---------\n\nEdit : I want to make some facts clear -\n\n1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. \n\n\n2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit 2 :\n\n\n3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. \n\nIn fact, she didn't mention him at all. \n\n4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.\n\nWe have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.\n\nI plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26441"}

This post has really blown up but anyway...**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Content warning: Transphobia\\*\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband is a transgender man and we've always wanted to start a family together. I have a huge fear of pregnancy so he offered to carry the baby. It was an insane process. He had to stop taking testosterone for a long time but he was amazing throughout the whole process and I did everything in my power to help him feel more comfortable.\n\nNone of my family know that he is transgender (homophobic, transphobic, all the phobics), but our friends know. He posted an ultrasound to his private instagram, not knowing that my sister follows him on a burner account. Well, she saw the photo and told my whole family. They were FURIOUS that I wouldn't tell them (our plan was to say we adopted). They assumed I was the one pregnant and blew up on me, so I just let it go and rolled with the lie because I wasn't going to out my husband.\n\nThe first couple of months I'd let them visit, eventually I'd start eating big meals and purposely bloating myself to the point of discomfort so I looked pregnant. They'd remark around the 6 month mark that I was remarkably small but I just played it off. Eventually I couldn't lie any longer, so I looked for every excuse in the book to not see my family. I turned down the offers of baby showers, gender reveal parties, anything that would require us seeing each other. Luckily my family live an hour away and we all live busy lifestyles, so them randomly visiting wasn't an issue. The one time they did pop in unexpectedly, we were out of the house. If they Facetimed, I made a point to be in bed feeling horribly sick so I couldn't give a \"bump update\". I lied my ass off and they just thought I had a rough pregnancy.\n\nMy husband gave birth a year ago and went straight back on the testosterone, and now we're happy as ever. My family have met our daughter and they adore her.\n\nA week ago, after an argument between myself and a friend, said friend decided to out my husband by messaging my family and included proof. They did it by adding everybody to a group chat, posting screenshots and basically the whole story, then saying \"I'll leave you all to discuss\", then they left the chat and blocked me and my husband.\n\nIn a transphobic rage, my mother raced to my home and all but beat my front door down. It wasn't pretty. I had to call the cops. I've been disowned, but that hasn't stopped the daily calls and texts coming from my parents, aunts, uncles, siblings etc., leaving nasty transphobic slurs on my voicemail and other hateful crap.\n\nI ended up crying to my friend yesterday who told me that I should have been honest with my family, as it would've saved me a lot of heart ache. That, or said we miscarried and then adopted later. I'm not happy that things played out the way they did. I just feel so sad now. Maybe it was wrong to lie to my family, but I feel like I had no choice.\n\n**Edit, because I figured I'd put this in the main text:**\n\nMy husband has always encouraged me to maintain a relationship with my family however it was mostly for his sake. Personally, I mentally checked out years ago. But when they met him, they welcomed him with open arms and treated him like a son. Yes, it was conditional on him being presumed cisgender, however we never intended for them to find out. He felt a familial love that he's never had from his own family before, which is why I kept my relationship with my parents at his request. If it weren't for him, I most likely would have cut them off a long time ago. I'm sad that this has happened, but most of that sadness is for my husband rather than for me.\n\nAlso the friend in this story who outed him is obviously no longer a friend, and never will be again. The other friend who said I should've told the truth is on thin ice.\n\n**Another edit: Y'all are making us ugly cry. Thank you so much for the support.**\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26441"}

The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again.\n\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything.\n\n\nWell, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of\" and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused. \n\nHe's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement.\n\n\nINFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom.\n\n\nSo My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space \"from me\". This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26436"}

Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.\n\nAs is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. \n\nWhile listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. \n\nShe began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. \n\nNow, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. \n\nI don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said \"I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?\" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, \"You guys made your first million yet? Because I have.\" \n\nThe room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.\n\nWas I an asshole?\n\nP.S. First million in our local currency not USD.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26426"}

I got mad at her for this, I was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, I mean I could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.\n\nI yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, I told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, I told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.\n\nShe got mad and left, I basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, I called the guys and told them I wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that I'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a \"plastic leg\" over her.\n\nI had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.\n\nHave I been an a**** to her ?\n\n\nEdit: for those asking about where I am, I'm in Asia, From Philippines.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26430"}

They have 4 kids (F10, M8, M5, F3) and she\u2019s pregnant. My sister works a full time job (40+ hours a week, cleans her entire house, cooks, takes care of all her children without him doing ANYTHING. It is seriously mind blowing that she wakes up at like 4 am, cooks breakfast, does chores, gets all of her kids ready for school, takes them all to school and daycare and all he does is stay home and work and when his kids get home (after my sister picks them up of course) he will play with them for a little and play video games until he falls asleep. she actually makes MORE than him! My fianc\u00e9 (M 26) and i had to stay with them for 6 weeks while our home was being renovated and since we both wfh, we helped her and it is AMAZING how much happier she is when she has help. I helped with the kids and my fianc\u00e9 even drove her to doctors appointments. Her husband literally only acknowledges he is a parent when his family is around, then he is a god fearing, hard working, father of 5. he is the one that wanted more kids, she wanted to stop after her last baby but he \u201cneeded more boys\u201d. I am seriously concerned not only for her, but her kids as well because now her oldest is seeing what\u2019s happening and trying to help but my sister is prideful and refuses to let her child do anything. \n\nMe and this man have never gotten along. He\u2019s been acting like this since their 8 year old was born. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about leaving but she doesn\u2019t want her kids to grow up in a broken home, and unfortunately her experience with our parents divorce was completely different than mine so she doesn\u2019t understand that a divorce would benefit her kids here because she thinks they need their mom and dad together. \n\nCut to this past weekend, her and her husband threw a pre thanksgiving pot luck where our entire family + his was there. I stayed with my sister a few days before because i knew he wouldn\u2019t help. So we\u2019re at dinner all talking and i mention we are trying for a babyand my BIL makes an off handed comment to him about how hard fatherhood is, and i snapped and said \u201clike you would know\u201d he looked taken aback and asked me what i meant and i unloaded on him, calling him a pathetic excuse for a man who makes my 8 months pregnant sister do everything for their family. i went off for a solid 10 minutes and he sat there shrinking in his seat. i left.\n\nLast night my sister called me and thanked me for standing up for her and told me she appreciated me. Although today i got a very nasty text from him telling me i\u2019m a terrible person and because i \u201clied\u201d in front of his family his mom is angry at him and is moving in with them to help her out and i\u2019ve made him the laughing stalk of his family. He certainly thinks so, but AITA for doing this?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26409"}

He\u2019s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he\u2019s got my parents convinced he just doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing, and they don\u2019t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he\u2019s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.\n\nThe problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I\u2019m sorry that they feel that way, but I\u2019m still going. Well here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they\u2019d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.\n\nI got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn\u2019t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I\u2019d just not live my life because of him?\n\nShe started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I\u2019m refusing. My grandpa said he\u2019s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don\u2019t think I need to give them one.

I don't care if you think this post is fake, but to assume that just because here is a name you are not familiar with you think I am bound to be racist, it makes you racist yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.\n\nI asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.\n\nMy daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26385"}

Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. \nI tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.\n I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating \" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now\" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of \" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me.\" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.\n \nI feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26382"}

My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets \"family\" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.\n\nI been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.\n\nI saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. \n\nHe realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank \"bro\" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue \"family\" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll \"raise\" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.\n\nEDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26361"}

We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.\n\nOne day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren\u2019t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.\n\nA few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our \"wedding anniversary\" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.\n\n4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.\n\nToday was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it\u2019s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.\n\nI was furious at her comments because she wasn\u2019t just a \u201cdead girl\u201d. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It\u2019s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.\n\nWhen I told her that I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came back home yet.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26332"}

I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.\n\nMy FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.\n\nHe complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through \"a bit of everyday noise\".\n\nI told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.\n\nI've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.\n\nI decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day.

Some context; I live in CA, and my wife\u2019s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She\u2019s 22, I\u2019ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She\u2019s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She\u2019s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.\n\nBut then my wife goes, \u201cAnd she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he\u2019s 47.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m 41, my wife is 42. I was like \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. At first, I was like \u201cHell no.\u201d But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I\u2019m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\n\n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it\u2019s weird).\n\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\n\n3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\n\n4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman\u2019s history with her father? \n\n5. What\u2019s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\n\nI know, I\u2019m not the girl\u2019s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \n\nSo, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I\u2019m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \n\nAfter only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is \u201cNone of my business.\u201d I got a little pissed at that. \n\nI told him he\u2019s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I\u2019m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. I replied that I\u2019m uncomfortable having a dude who\u2019s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you\u2019re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.\n\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it\u2019s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\n\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?\n\nEDIT: some info:\n\nI asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.\n\nI would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \n\nWhen I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\n\nI would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what\u2019s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They\u2019re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. \n\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. \n\nAsked why they broke up.\n\nThe guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26298"}

He moved in with me and my daughter Zoey f13. Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly.\n\nAnyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's \"allowed\" to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married.\n\nFew days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him.\n\n\nHe sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him.\n\nHe's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting.\n\n\nAITA for blowing up on him infront of his family?\n\nHere's some cat tax https://imgur.com/a/lOUovCh\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26297"}

The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.\n\nWhen Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.\n\nWhen I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.\n\nMy sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.\n\nShe keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.\n\nWe had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said \"auntie keeps turning the wifi off\". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.\n\nWhen we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone \"forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter\" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.\n\nSince leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26278"}

We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay.\n\nI pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that we'll split the check between us. Sam mumbled \"no you don't have to, we invited you\" but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me; I asked what was wrong and both MIL & FIL said they didn't have money on them. I was shocked I turned to Sam and he said he too forgot his wallet at home and didn't bring enough money to cover even on round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously \"aright so guess we should let the doctor pay!!\" I was taken a back I said I'm sorry but no this is just so much money to spend on one dinner by myself and I didn't think I was expected to pay the entire bill. Sam said I should pay and he'd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said I'm sorry but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation by him and family where I'm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expectbothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner. I told them I'll only pay for what I had and that's it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting as if they were strangers not family but that doesn't mean I'm obligated to pay, how could someone go out to a fancy restuarant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money?. Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out.\n\n\nSam called later at 2am basically yelling that I ruined NYE celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill amd instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay even if I have a good salary doesn't mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didn't reply he just said he'll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them.\n\nI felt awful thinking I should've covered the bill instead of leaving.

She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \"fun\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \"acceptable\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\n\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \"green\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\n\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \"unethical\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\n\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.\n\n**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26269"}

(About $700) \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nI had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\n\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nWell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?\n\nEdit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as \"why are you so shity?\" because I've been banned.\n\nEdit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\n\nEdit3: gotta address this one directly:\n\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.\n\nIf the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process.\n\nEdit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him. \n\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\n\n\nEdit5: a good question:\n\n>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.\n\nNo he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.\n\nEdit6: another good question\n\n>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?\n\n\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nEdit7: \n\n>INFO\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\n\nSo this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine \"nerd\" could correct me if I'm way off base.\n\nEdit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.\n\n> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.\n\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\n\n1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\n\n2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the \"you're a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \n\n3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. \n\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \n\n5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).\n\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\n\n>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEdit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\n\n\nEdit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out.

We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>\nWho likes to crash at our house with her friends. \n\nMy wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.\nMy sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.\n\nLast week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. \n\nMy wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.\nThey wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.\n\nThey ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house.\n\nI tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore.\n\nMy mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. \n\nAm I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. \nBetween my wife and my sister.\n\nUpdate* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.\n\nI talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home. \n\nI asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean.\n\nThe last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.\n\nAlso my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.\n\nI did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.\n\nUpdate: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.\n\nThe big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.\n\nLast update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. \nI already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key.\n\nEarly morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.\nMy wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.\n\nMy sister was silent the whole time coming back home.\nI can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded.\n\nLast and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.\n1) for awhile no family at our home\n2) no family borrowing our things. \n3)no one is allowed a key\n4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.\n5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. \nMy wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26222"}

He's bed ridden and his family come to see him everyday.\nMIL keeps \"drilling\" what I need to do to make my husband comfortable but does nothing to help. Just visits everyday and sits around expecting to be fed and entertained. Sometimes BIL, his wife & kids join them and turn the house into a mess.\n\nYesterday MIL, her husband and son came again. They checked on my husband then went to sit in the living room for hours. I served them coffee and croissant. Hours later my husband threw up again (2nd time) I had to take care of changing his clothes and cleaning the sheets to avoid infections.\nI was exhausted, I came downstairs and MIL looked at me and asked \" hey where's our dinner?\".\n\nI was shocked that after seeing me go up and downstairs many times and cleaning and bringing new sheets and running the washing machine that she'd expect me to prepare dinner. I'd already eaten a sandwich at 6 and yogurt ( I have problems with my stomach and stress and pregnancy made it worse, I'm 4 months in)\n\n\nI pointed at the kitchen and told her to help herself out. She gave me a look then said she didn't expect me to ask *her* to cook dinner at *my* house. I said I didn't expect her to ask ME to cook dinner while I'm taking care of her son. She started arguing about the way I spoke about my husband saying as his partner, *this is the least I could do* and called me unhinged for throwing in her face that I'm helping my husband.\n\nShe got her husband involved asking what his thoughts were on me making guests go hungry and forcing them to cook themselves when this supposed to be my duty as a host/home owner. FIL said they could order food and call it a day and yelled at my younger BIL to stop playing on his phone and order food but MIL got mad and lashed out criticizing me saying I wasn't up to the challenge of taking care of my home and my guests like an adult. I lost it on her and told them to leave since she kept yelling disrupting my husband's sleep. She left after saying she felt sorry for her son and grandbaby with an \"aggressive wife and a mother like me\".\n\nShe told everyone and my older BIL said he understood I'd a lot on my plate but lectured me about how I should have respect for his mom who was a guest. Repeatedly saying if that was his wife she wouldn't have acted this way. And that I shouldn't use taking care of my husband against them. He asked me to apologize but I didn't.\n\nInfo: My husband suffers from 2 major injuries and he's got a long recovery ahead. Right now there's so much pressure to take care of him while keeping up with house chores and work. My mom and sister help but not MIL. She claimed that when I told them to leave I was refusing to let her see her sick son but I'd never do that. I lost a loved one before seeing them so I understand her fear but BIL thought that was my goal.\n\nEDIT: I live in the states, in the south.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26229"}

The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\n\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\n\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\n\nWas I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\n\nEdit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.\n\nEdit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26224"}

Ever since she was a toddler, she'd spend hours doing her hair every day, braiding it, straightening it and styling it in all sorts of ways. Our bathroom cabinets are always filled to the brim with a bunch of hair lotions, oils, creams and other fancy products I don't even know the names of. So I think it's more than fair to say that my wife's a bit obsessed with the whole hair thing. Anna, however, has never been too fond of getting her hair done, or of anything that involves having to sit still for more than a few minutes.\n\nBefore she got it cut, her hair used to reach past her waist. And while it looked lovely, she hated getting it brushed and every morning used to be a screaming fest between her and my wife. Lately, she'd been begging for a shorter haircut. My wife ignored her whenever the topic was brought up in hopes that she'd forget about it, but none of that ended up happening. \n\nI think Anna realized she was getting nowhere with her mom, because she started asking me to take her instead. I was reluctant to at first because I didn't know how my wife would react, but I agreed when I saw just how excited the kid was over something as simple as a haircut.\n\nSo yesterday I drove her to the hairdresser, where she got to flip through a lot of magazines and pick a picture of a haircut. And when she chose a really short clipper cut, I knew I was gonna be in deep shit with my wife. At that point though, there was no turning back. I mean, what could I have really done? Told her that no, she can't get the haircut she was so over the moon about, all because her mom wouldn't like it? I couldn't do that.\n\nSo we went ahead with the haircut, and by the end of it Anna couldn't stop smiling. She went around the salon showing it off to everyone and even asked me to take a bunch of pictures even though she normally hates having pictures taken of her. We did get one rude comment from an older woman at the salon, something along the lines of 'You can't even tell if she's a boy or a girl now', but Anna was way too excited about her hair to notice, and if she did notice she didn't care.\n\nWhen my wife got home from work that day though, things quickly took a turn for the worse. She refused to even look at Anna, locked herself in her room and cried then got in the car and drove off. It's been a day now and she's still not back, it's honestly starting to worry me. I knew she wouldn't react well to the haircut but I wasn't expecting her to take it this badly. The kid's upset too and no matter how much I reassure her she still thinks she's in trouble for getting her hair cut. \n\nAITA? I realize how attached my wife was to Anna's hair, but at the end of the day I still think it's just hair. The kid's old enough to decide these things for herself and she was really happy with the haircut, so I don't think I did something wrong here.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26195"}

His family is a stereotypical country one and they get ridiculously mad when they see beyond meat etc adverts on the tv. They\u2019re practically vegan phobic and hate any menu which says suitable for vegetarians or vegans etc. This never really bothered me and I thought it was funny because I ate meat and I didnt think it was a big deal.\n\nMy daughter (now6) was born allergic to a lot of things, like eggs and is also intolerant to lactose and grass, pollen etc. She rarely got to go to birthday parties because we couldn\u2019t let her eat anything there. when she was a baby my husband ate an egg sandwich and kissed her and she broke out in hives and we had to take her to the doctor. All new foods were tried under medical supervision.\n\nWhile she can eat meat she can\u2019t eat any fun meat like nuggets because of egg contact. One of the kids she recently met with is our new Neighbour who is around four houses away. They are completely vegan and their son doesn\u2019t eat anything they don\u2019t. So at his birthday she could eat the actual  cake and not a muffin I\u2019d sent. It cheered her up and they had play dates even when we weren\u2019t supposed to. I was glad she made a friend.\n\nHis parents  hadn\u2019t called for a while and didn\u2019t pick up ours. When I saw his dad while I was out I was like \u2018hey what\u2019s wrong\u2018 and he was really hostile, telling me to never talk to him or his wife again and that he\u2019d pray for my daughter. I thought that was crossing the line. He pulled his phone out and showed me a very rude text from my husband. I didn\u2019t believe his story that my husband started a fight, but when I asked him about it he was proud that Shelia wasn\u2019t hanging out with hippies. I remembered the vegan hate and I was like until he apologized to that family and they agreed to let their kid play with ours I\u2019d never cook meat again. He said I needed to get over it and do my Job but I am cooking, just not what he would like. AITA\n\nEdit: I will try to find couple\u2019s counseling although I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll agree to it. I hope Ina forgives me (vegan mom, since this blew up, I\u2019m really very sorry and I won\u2019t bother you again.) thank you all for your responses.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26159"}

I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.\n\nWe hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.\n\nOn Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.\n\nI got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.\n\nI fucking screamed \"What the hell are you doing?!\" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.\n\nAfter I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that \"ugly ass\" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.\n\nBlack Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.\n\nI asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned \"Get the fuck out of my house. Now.\" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.\n\nOf course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't \"graciously\" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an \"honest mistake\" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said \"You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that.\" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.\n\n**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26145"}

Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can\u2019t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. **She\u2019s in therapy and is working on it.**\n\nFirst program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn\u2019t understand why the other child wasn\u2019t punished for it. This daycare didn\u2019t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming \u201cone of those moms\u201d. \n\nWe chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn\u2019t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won\u2019t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn\u2019t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part. \n\nThen, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled. She said at this point, she will only be responding at specific times of the day and not looking the rest. The owner then added sent several pages of the contract with passages highlighted, reminding us of certain policies my wife had violated.\n\nI was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget. My wife made a million excuses, including that it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s anxious. I said if we are asked to leave this program too, my wife will be the one quitting her job to watch Alexis, not me. This upset my wife. I pointed out I\u2019ve spoken to her kindly about this plenty of times. I encourage her to keep up her therapy. But she can\u2019t keep getting us kicked out of programs. My wife is now not speaking to me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I cannot be the primary contact for daycare due to not being able to have my phone on me at work.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26142"}

Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into. And thankfully my dad has been able to cover the cost of a private therapist and I see her again Tuesday. \n\n\nThank you all so much again for your kind words\n\n\n2nd edit: if I had realised this was going to blow up so much then I probably would have just posted to my main.\n\nIf you see this post anyway, read it Lewis. Then read it again. Then read the comments. Then just leave me alone. \n\n\nThank you all for your comments. I'm going to show my therapist the post when I see her and talk it through, but honestly it has helped alot. Even if I did cry quite a bit. I'm going to sleep now and won't be back on this post. But thank you all \u2665\ufe0f\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26132"}

Suing my neighbor after she sprayed weedicide on my lawn \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nCaught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said \u201cshe was sick of all the weeds\u201d and thought she was doing me a solid.\n\n1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees\n\n2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it\u2019s literally poisoning my pets.\n\nSo anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.\n\nNow 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I\u2019ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) \n\nSo I\u2019m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. \n\nShe\u2019s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it\u2019s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I\u2019m not risking another animal\u2019s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I\u2019m being unnecessarily cruel because it \u201cwas an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is\u201d and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills\n\nEdit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before\n\nI don\u2019t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of\n\nHer: \u201chey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cyup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn\u201d \n\nHer: \u201cSomething about my new car.\u201d\n\nThe end\n\nSince she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she\u2019d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn\u2019t get to that week would be sprouting\n\nEdit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.\n\nEdit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said \u201cit\u2019s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick\u201d\n\nEdit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn\u2019t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can\u2019t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.\n\nUPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. \n\nMy 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He\u2019ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready \n\nFor those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven\u2019t responded, probably won\u2019t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. \n\nAnd for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn\u2019t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.\n\nPlease in the future; avoid messaging me for updates \n\nI have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that\u2019s just beyond rude STOP IT.

I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to \"toughen\" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.\n\nWhen my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet \"hooks\" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.\n\nAfter that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.\n\nWhen I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.\n\nMy dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just \"toughen\" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?\n\nEdit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not \"needles.\" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a \"needle.\" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.\n\nEdit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26113"}

Let\u2019s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We\u2019re not best friends but we are friendly. We don\u2019t really spend much time together.  \n\n\nOver time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn\u2019t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don\u2019t owe the style and she\u2019s free to wear what she likes but it\u2019s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.\n\n\nBut then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I couldn\u2019t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I\u2019d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. \nI joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. \nBasically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It\u2019s just really creepy but I haven\u2019t said anything, I wouldn\u2019t even know what to say.\n\nOver the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.\n\nI deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it\u2019s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.\nShe kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it\u2019s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she\u2019s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26100"}

We have 2 kids (Jeremy 16 & Raya 14) now Jeremy is a jokester, he likes pulling pranks on everyone in the house...and that included the house keeper. He did stuff like throw her purse, hide her wallet and got punished for  it then told to not do it again because our house keeper almost quit and we didn't wanr that.\n\n\nNow onto the current situation...sone days ago I got a call from Jeremy while he was having friends over telling me he saw the house keeper sneak one of my jewelry into her purse and asked me to come home immediately. I freaked out and tried to call my husband but he didn't pick. I went home and was mad, I talked to the house keeper and she denied putting anything in her purse, I demanded to see her purse and my jewelry was there. The house keeper started swearing on her children that she didn't put it in there and had no idea how it got there....I believed her and figured Jeremy had something to do with it given his history. I switched my attention towards him and had him explain to me exactly how he saw our house keeper do it. He told me what he saw but a friend of his came forward and said that he saw Jeremy put the jewelry inside the lady's purse and was trying to get her in trouble. Jeremy yelled at his friend then told me it was just one of his pranks but I was furious, I kicked the rest of his friends who covered for him out and I punished him hard and apologized to the house keeper.\n\nMy husband reacted unexpectly after he heard and said that I was wrong for choosing to believe the house keeper over our son even though there was a witness but he said his friend must've said this to get him in trouble or because the house keeper paid him to side woth her which was shockingly absurd of him to say. He said I was not being a good mother and my first instinct is to always believe my son in whatever he says amd never ever question him infront of his friends like that.\n\nI'm confused, did I mess up?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26086"}

I live with my parents and my sister, Joanne, 23f. Joanne has a cocaine habit and she claims its normal in her job and it's just the lifestyle of cheffing, yada yada. My parents seem to be ignoring it since Joanne pays her rent on time and keeps to herself when she's in the house and doesn't cause many problems. \n\nI'm a college student on a government grant, and I'm in college Monday to Friday up until 5/6pm, working isn't really an option for me right now, so I don't go out much and I spend all my money on college supplies. Joanne doesn't seem to understand this and is always asking to borrow money and what not. I always say no because it works out that I only have \u20ac40 every week to spend on college stuff and travel to college. \n\nI got a Christmas bonus on my grant and I ended up deciding to book tickets for a small ish local gig that's next week. I booked two, one for me and one for my best friend because her birthday is the same day and she loves the type of music, it was meant to be a surprise for her. I had told Joanne about this on one of her \"good days\" because I was genuinely excited to finally do something and live the college student lifestyle for a night. \n\nThe tickets were digital, on an account shared with my parents. Joanne had asked for the login telling them that she wanted to book tickets to something, but she was lying and used it to sell my tickets for drug money. I didn't find out until I had gotten the email to confirm that the tickets were sent to someone else and I was really confused at first. I checked and they were sent to someone I know Joanne knows. \n\nI went straight to her when she got home and asked what the fuck she did, and she tried lying but I showed her proof it went to someone she knows and told her I wanted my money back then and there. She told me it was gone already. I lost my mind and started yelling at her, because it wasn't fair. \n\nMy mom was just in from work and I was screaming at my sister who was crying at that point saying she was sorry and she didn't know it would upset me this much. My mom got involved and told me to keep my voice down and we'll talk about it, and I told her to shut up and stay out of it. I ended up saying something along the lines of \"why is it fair that you get to do this to me when I've never even drank alcohol or smoked weed, why does the cokewhore get to be the golden child bit not me?\". \n\nMy mom stepped in and put a stop to it then and there, my sister had started screaming back at me for what I called her. My mom said that was out of line and she just made a mistake. I told my mom her mistake cost me the only night out ill have been able to have all year so she should hear what I have to say about it. My mom thinks I was in the wrong for what I said, and my sister won't even look at me even though its been 3 days and I've tried apologising.

A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nEarlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nHe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said \"Okay\", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.\n\nMy group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd. AITA?\n\nEdit: in case anyone was interested: I'm not going to post a photo of my leg because of identification reasons but I'll describe it. So the base color is ombre whiteish green to pale green and it has cherry blossoms painted on it, though sometimes I wear a silicone cover that resembles an actual foot and leg on days when I don't want people to stare at me. I even have temporary stickies I can put on the \"toes\" to make it look like I painted my nails. It's actually really cool!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26064"}

She\u2019s in high school. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn\u2019t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I\u2019m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. Anyway\n\nMy cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. \n\nShe begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she\u2019s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t respond to her and think nothing of it. \n\nThe weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don\u2019t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP\u2019d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. \n\nSince I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I\u2019m surprise she didn\u2019t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.\n\nTo save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she\u2019s \u201cjust a kid\u201d and that she\u2019s been through a lot of \u2018emotional stress\u2019 doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I\u2019m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to egg anyone\u2019s car) and can\u2019t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she\u2019s young, that she doesn\u2019t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could\u2019ve been avoided had I let her take my car. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\nI need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She\u2019s not remorseful of anything.\n\nAlso, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26066"}

We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e8 sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's \"just a confidence boost\" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.\n\nHe's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?\n\n[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26051"}

Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.\n\nI was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.\n\nJosh, now almost 13, has been calling me \"dad\" and my wife \"mum\" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.\n\nSome of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me \"dad\" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.\n\nI discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the \"father figure\" everyone deserves.\n\nI feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying \"sooner than later\". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26047"}

The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. \n\nLast week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. \n\nIt's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. \n\nSo today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. \n\nNow he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. \n\nAITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?\n\nEdit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this much of a response. Thank you all for your thoughts, upvotes, and the awards.

Forgive me for the vague details for privacy but I'll mention all the relevent stuff, I promise.\n\nWhen I went into labor I had the most difficult time of my life, I was in pain for hours. My mom was with me but she had to go and my husband was with me the entire time. I did something so embarrasing in the delivery room, I pooped myself which was unexpected and just...I don't know but it was embarrassing and although my medical team were very professional about it, my husband couldn't help himself and started laughing about it later and even telling my family about it but they didn't react, just didn't find it funny and neither did I, In fact, I found it embarrassing and I already told him to stop bringing it up especially when he started joking about getting me diapers for my \"opsies!!\". It got really tiring and chipped away from my selfesteem and confidence.\n\n\nWe were with his parents celebrating new year's eve together when I excused myself to the bathroom. while I was getting up he made a quick remark and said \"oh yeah, you should go quickly because we don't want any accidents just like the one we had at the hospital, you know what I mean?\" While blinking at me. His family actually laughed and BIL commented \"good one!\". I was astonished and so angry and ashamed, I literally just lost it on him and yelled at the top of my lungs calling him a cruel insensitive jerk to be using the difficult experience of birthing his child as a joking matter and humiliating me infront of everybody. He was shocked, staring back at me and not saying a word. All went silent and I just stormed off to the bathroom til we left and that was when he snapped saying I messed up by talking to him like that infront of his family during dinner, I said I couldn't hold my tongue for that long and after he kept joking about an embarrassing thing when I told him to stop. he said he was just joking and I went overboard with my reaction and also, I should've sucked it up and waited til we got home so we could address this privately and I could even yell at him as long as I wanted. We argued about it after we got home and he kept saying I humiliated him infront of his family during the celebratory evening by being petty and trying to one up him... He even said I should've laughed along not fly off the handle liks that.\n\nDid I overreact?.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26032"}

(The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.\n\nThe floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. \n\nAnother week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.\n\nLast night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of \"skirt\" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. \n\nBF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. \n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 26030"}

She told me I can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. I told her I can and I will. Her response was telling me I am being unfair making her choose between us and I said I'm not making her choose because I'm fine not being invited, I know my stance means I will end up being excluded. But I will not play nice with her and my ex. Especially now that they are getting married too. We're never going to play happy families. I don't want to be civil to them.

To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I\u2019m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn\u2019t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. \n\nFast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she\u2019s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I\u2019m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn\u2019t even make sense) does not \u201cruin\u201d my face and even if it does it\u2019s really not her place.

My dad married my step mom just about a year ago. She didn't want me to live here and wants me gone. I've insisted that I should stay as I don't want to live with my mom (her husband is a piece of work...) so we're always clashing.\n\nShe announced last month that she wouldn't allow me to eat anything she cooks, or cook anything that she buys and I should arange my own food completely separately (down to the ingredient level, including salt!) because I'm not her problem to deal with. This is annoying but anyway, I can handle it and I didn't want to act entitled so I started buying and cooking my own food. We've been going like this since then.\n\nHer sister had an accident a few days ago and on the day of the accident step mother texted me in the afternoon saying she's bringing the sister's children over and they'll arrive around midnight, asked me to buy groceries and snacks and make a late dinner for them. I never replied to her and didn't do anything. I have to say that while for a few hours it didn't look good for her sister and had to go into surgery it ended up being successful and she will thankfully make a full recovery.\n\nThey came, she noticed there's no food and they indeed were hungry so she was angry at me and I told her that it's not my problem to deal with... and she said I'm being a jerk and I said takes one to know one.

I told him that our relationship has always been hopeless because she hated me for no reason so there's nothing I can do that can make her hate me any less and at this point I've accepted it and don't care anymore.

I lost my dad to cancer when I was 13 years old. We were very close and his death was a major loss in my life.\nI wasn't able to keep much of his belongings because of my stepdad's insecurities and lack of sympathy and respect for me and my dad. It's sad to say that mom moved on relatively fast.\n\nMy stepsister and I share a room together (my step brother has the bigger room because he's a \"man\") and as a result me and my stepsister are always in conflict. She wants me out during the day as she uses the room as her art studio. She recently accused me of stealing her tools and convinced her dad to get a lock so now I'm being forcefully locked out and can't get in til after a huge argument and getting mom involved.\n\n My stepsister had an argument with her brother and ruined his gaming console when he was out.

I asked if he got permission he said yes so I gave it to him and went back to study.\n\nAt dinner, my step sister came downstairs yelling that her brother had access to her room and ruined her paintset. There was a lot of yelling and arguing. Step dad asked how my step brother walked into the room when it was supposed to be locked. My step brother \"admitted\" I helped him out and brought the paintset to hi. My stepsister went off on me, called an accomplice then ran upstairs and took the gift I prepared for my dad for father's day.\n(I picked up flowers I planted from our small garden that I take care of by myself. And prepared a nice wooden letter shaped pot ~used my dad's first initial~\nand filled it with the flowers I picked and decorated it with ribbons. It wasn't that good but it was like a floral letter.

Kelly became pregnant with Opal at sixteen. My husband, Eddy, and I have always believed in having the right to choose. However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.\n\nWe helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn\u2019t complain about why she \u201chad to be there\" to look after Opal.\n\nKelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.\n\nKelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well. She has good friends, plays Tennis, participates in volunteer projects, and plans to be a marine biologist after graduation.\n\nThe school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend\u2019s child.\n\nWe already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal\u2019s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were \u201cso busy!\u201d with life right now.\n\nEddy and I interrupted Kelly and told her we would have nothing to do with raising this new baby and would not be providing anything for it (supplies, childcare, etc.) Kelly flipped out and an argument ensued.\n\nKelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.\n\nKelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into \u201csides.\u201d The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don\u2019t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.\n\nOpal likes to show us stories from here sometimes, so I thought it would be a good place to ask for a neutral perspective. AITA?\n\nEdit: Opal is always able to express her feelings with me or Eddy. Opal also has a therapist who is available to speak whenever she needs it. Opal visited the therapist weekly during middle school but now hasn't needed to see him more than once a month. We will be taking Opal on a mall trip to make up for what happened at the celebration dinner.\n\nWe spoke privately to Opal after this incident and she knows we in no way view her as a burden. Our granddaughter is a blessing and many of our happiest moments involved supporting Opal and watching her grow up. But Opal is sixteen: She doesn't need the kind of constant attention and care that a newborn baby does. We are now too old to be able to adequately raise a newborn baby even if we wanted to.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Kelly is now an adult and needs to start acting like one. Kelly is supposed to outlive us. The reality is that Eddy and I aren't going to be alive for her or her children's entire lives. It is why Kelly needs to accept that she cannot expect us to take on her responsibilities and must be independent.\n\nEdit #2: Several people have informed me that the part where Kelly expected us to raise the new baby was unclear, so I apologize for that. I thought it was self-explanatory, but realize none of you actually experienced what happened.\n\nKelly talked about how busy she and her boyfriend were with their lives, then began to talk about how \"grateful\" she was that we \"would always look after our grandchildren\" and how since we had \"gained so much joy from raising Opal, we would be even happier raising this second baby!\"\n\nAfter Eddy and I called her out, Kelly confirmed that she had expected us to adopt and raise this second baby as well. Kelly said how she and her boyfriend did not have time to raise a baby but that putting up the baby for adoption would be \"throwing it away.\" She assumed we, at almost sixty years old, would have no troubles or opposition to raising a newborn baby.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25956"}

He was divorced, and previously widowered. He has two daughters. Annie who is now 26 (I believe) from his first marriage and Amy who is 17 from his second. My husband told me about his late wife, his ex wife, the issues he had as a blended family when he remarried and Annie was not on board with him remarrying and the fact this strain ended his second marriage. He was also honest that Annie never forgave him for remarrying and never wanted anything to do with Amy or him after she turned 18.\n\nWhat he did not tell me was the MAJOR role he played in all of this. I found this out three weeks ago, at a dinner with his extended family.\n\nThe story as I now know it. When Amy was around 5 years old she took a special interest in a necklace that belonged to his late wife. My husband gave the necklace to Amy, which upset Annie, because all her mothers possessions were meant to go to her. My husband told Annie that it was just one item and she needed to get over it because Amy was entitled to have something too. Annie had brought up that it was the piece her mother wore the most. My husband told her that it was a special gift to give to her sister. That she was being selfish. His ex wife told her that her mother would want \"someone as special as your sister\" to have a piece of her as well. Annie never got over it. She tried to take it from Amy and was punished. The last time she saw any of them she told them all to go to fucking hell.\n\nAmy still has the necklace too. She has let it get into a bad way, and talks about it as if her dad bought it for her.\n\nI was shocked. I never would have expected my husband to be that way. He was very unapologetic about it and told me Annie would have to get over it some day. I told him he should be ashamed of himself. That he should have allowed Annie's mothers possessions to be hers, to do with as SHE chose, that Amy did not give a crap about his late wife or the significance of those items, but Annie would have. I told him he will be incredibly lucky if his daughter ever speaks to him again and I would not blame her if she never did.\n\nHe was furious I judged him.

My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.\n\n\n\nFor this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a \"cookie sample\" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.\n\n\nI came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said \"it was done\" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.\n\n\nLater I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.\n\n\n\nAITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?\n\n\nInfo. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.\n\n\nInfo Few things to put on here:\n\n1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.\n\n2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.\n\n3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.\n\n\nUpdate: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25923"}

I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25923"}

I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. \n\nHe refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it.

This happened about a year ago. \n\nMe and my BF have been together for 5 years. His sister, Claire, has a 1 year old baby, Alex. \n\nClaire is a single mom and sometimes drops her baby off at our place when she has some errands to run. I will be honest here. I have no clue how to take care of a baby. I play with the baby but other than that my BF usually takes care of Alex. \n\nMy BF work is onsite. So he usually isn't home for 4 days and then comes home for 3 days. One day, Claire asked my BF if she can drop off Alex for the day. BF was supposed to leave for work that evening. Since she had said that she will pick up the baby by evening, he didn't mention that. Big mistake. He left around 5 pm. \n\nI was waiting for Claire and kept calling her. She picked up the phone around 8 pm and told me that she went to a place few hours away with her friends. She told me to tell BF to take care of Alex for next 3-4 days. I told her that BF already left for work. Then she just told me \"Then you take care of Alex. I will back in 4 days.\" And then she hung up on me and switched off her phone. \n\nI freaked out hard. I cannot call BF because he is unreachable onsite. Neither of us have family in the state that we could have called. I called few friends but no one gave me anything helpful. The bag she gave with Alex only had diapers left in it. The baby was crying her head off and I didn't even know what to feed her safely. \n\nI literally didn't know how else to do. So, I called the police and told them what happened. They directed me to a social worker. While the social worker was helping me take care of the baby, the cops called the cops where she was to locate her. \n\nThe cops found her high marijuana and she had enough on her for them to classify it as possesion and intention to sell (Edit: I don't think she actually sold anything. She probably just brought enough for her and her friends for the next few days). She didn't get any jail time. She had to do community service and plead guilty. Unfortunately, that also meant she got a felony conviction. This got her fired and she hasn't been able to hold on to a good job since. \n\nIn my defense, I only wanted her to come back because I didn't want anything to happen to Alex because I am not capable of taking care of her. I did not think she was doing anything that would get her arrested. \n\nIn her defense, she has left Alex at our home plenty of times, so it's not unreasonable for her to think that I would have no problem taking care of Alex for a few days. Also, this was probably the first time she took a break for herself since Alex was born. \n\nMy boyfriend was pissed in the beginning but came around later. Their parents also think I wasn't in the wrong. She obviously hates me and thinks I ruined her life because she wanted a break for a few days. \n\nThis got brought up recently at a family dinner which is why I ask. \n\nAITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25910"}

My house used to belong to my parents. But they sold it to me in 2017. It had been a family vacation home of sorts. Every couple years when my grandparents were alive they'd invite us kids up there for a week. Fast forward to the end of 2016. My sister got accepted to her dream college. Wont say which but it's a big one. Everyone was excited and proud of her, me too. But a week after that my parents called asking if I'd found a house yet.\n\nI was looking for one and my family knew it. I'd been saving up since I started my first job at 20. I said no so my dad suggested I buy the lake house from them. I asked why they wanted to sell it. Turns out sis didn't have any savings for college and didn't get some scholarship like she'd planned? And our parents couldn't afford to pay for everything either. I asked why she didn't get student loans and they said they didn't want her ruining her credit. So their solution was to sell the lake house and use the money from that to finance her college.\n\nI had lots of good memories from the lake house so eventually I agreed. I work via computer so after getting a good internet connection out there I moved right in, and been there since. My gf moved in permanently last year before lockdown and it's been pretty blissful.\n\n2019 my sister & her college bf got engaged. Parents agreed to pay for her wedding. But like with every other wedding around then things got set back. Sis had to postpone her wedding until this year. She plans to have it in Dec. I even agreed to be in the bridal party.\n\nIssues came up recently when my sis asked where I was going to stay for the 2 weeks after her wedding? Puzzled I answered my house? She got a sour look and said that wouldn't work, her and fiance would be there and they wanted private time. I asked why they'd be at my house and she said that's where they were having their honeymoon. Two weeks alone at a lake house. I said that was news to me. She insisted our parents said it was fine. But I said it wasn't their place to make decisions about my house.\n\nAfter arguing she called our parents who said I was being unreasonable. I said I didn't want my sister and her fiance christening their new union by fucking in my house. They said I was being gross and selfish. I said no again so sis threatened to remove me from the bridal party. I just shrugged and said okay. She starts crying, saying she already couldn't have her dream wedding like she wanted and now I was trying to ruin her honeymoon too. I told her to rent a hotel room like every other newlywed couple then hung up.\n\nShe's not speaking to me and I'm uninvited to the wedding. Our parents keep calling me and saying I should do this for her since her wedding is only 1/3 what she wanted it to be. But I'm not comfortable with them staying unsupervised at my house. They're making me feel like a monster for saying no. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nWell uh, learned something new today. I spoke to my sister like a few people suggested and asked her if she knew the lake house was legally MY house. As in, I bought it years ago. \n\nShe was NOT in fact aware of this. She was under the impression from our parents that they were letting me live there rent free...... I corrected her and even showed her proof that they sold the house to me. And when she asked why they sold it I was honest and said it was to pay for her college tuition/lifestyle. She became quiet after that and we soon hung up. \n\nNo idea what's going to happen now.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25905"}

Mostly aunts and female cousins aside from mom, stepmom, stepsister and grandmother. I don't know how to say this but all those women I mentioned above are into teasing and joking. They've formed a unit (which I admit is kind of toxic) and they'd tease and roast every new woman that enters the family by marriage by setting up \"tests\" to see if they deserve to be part of the family. Or roast their looks and styles to the point of breaking confidence and self esteem down. Then after a few months of teasing they'd announce that they've finally welcomed them into the family. The newest member would join in on the teasing too which is crazy as my dad says.\n\nWhen I first introduced my then girlfriend now wife. I made it clear that I didn't want any of the women in the unit to come at her or harass her not even with a single word. They went behind my back and roasted her looks and job and I discovered they've been doing it on Facebook. I had them apologize one by one after they gave the \"we're just testing the water to see if she's capable to be part of the family\" excuse\". They didn't want to apologize but once I said I wouldn't invite any of the unit unless they apologize including my mom everyone immediately apologized and brought gifts for my wife. First of them was my stepmom and my SIL.\n\n\nMy wedding was 2 weeks ago. There was talk about the women in the family wanting to pull a prank on my wife by wearing white and called it the \"ultimate test\" to see how my wife react. My brother warned me so I announced that if anyone of them showed up in white I'd have them kicked out including mom. They said this wasn't true and they'd never do such thing. But they showed up to my wedding one by one wearing white dresses and each an every one of them was told to leave after they tried giving excuses by either making scenes or getting the men involved. The senior women of the unit who are Mom and aunts also showed up in white but refused to leave. I threatened to take harsher action and mom was pissed telling me to step aside but I didn't let her in. I had her leave while the men in the family were watching stunned, dad was on my side and supported me a lot. I felt absolutely awful because my wedding was being interrupted by them making scenes. My wife was hurt beyond measure but the women in the family were pissed. my cousin blasted me on social media later saying I excluded all the women from the wedding because my wife was so insecure she couldn't handle another woman's presence at her wedding. I had an argument with them and mom berated me saying it was supposed to be a prank but I said they were taking it too far. Mom said I took it too far by kicking them out because they were trying to get reaction from my wife to see if she was one of those \"bridzillas\" and were going to change soon as prank was over but I ruined my own and entire wedding by reacting so aggressively. I stopped talking after she said I had to bring my wife and apologize. I haven't seen the lot of them in 2 weeks and they've excluded me from everything.\n\nWasITA for how I handled this?.\n\n____________\n\nI just want to explain that (A) this has been happening for years. The men in the family are split on this behavior, some of them encourage it like my uncle and my cousins' husbands (one is now an ex) and some are against it like me and my dad and brother.\n\n(B) the women claim that there's nothing hurtful in what they do because they claimed they're just looking out for us men and that their goal ultimately is to make sure the women who enter the family are decent.\n\n(C) My dad always ends up arguing with my mom and grandmother since they're the ones who started this  whole thing with their behavior and attitude towards other women.\n\n(D) and I'm not sure if I should mention this but my male cousin who's a middle schooler said he'd make sure to leave the country before even meeting any woman because of this and it made me chuckle.\nAlso the dresses they showed up in were simple white dresses nothing over the top but still were white dresses. I realized they went ahead with their plans even after I stated what I'd do in that case.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25885"}

I never really wanted them growing up but I figure I\u2019ll eventually have kids in the future once I get my life together. My cousin Sarah (29) has two bad behaved kids from a previous relationship and a newborn baby with her boyfriend MJ (40).\n\nLast night my mother, sister, Sarah and I went to a sushi restaurant - and this was my first time having sushi. After we ordered, I had a hard time using the chopsticks. My cousin started obnoxiously laughing. \n\nThe waiter came over and asked me if I wanted \u201ctraining wheels\u201d which is a little plastic item that attaches to the chopsticks and helps you hold them in place. My cousin laughed and said \u201csorry about her, she constantly embarrasses herself and us.\u201d\n\nI just gave her the side eye and put the training wheels on. When it was time to order desserts, her boyfriend MJ finally joined us - claiming that he was \u201cbusy.\u201d\nShe went on to tell him how \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d I was for not knowing how to use chopsticks and how the waiters and everyone around now know that I\u2019m an embarrassment. My mom asked her what her problem was and she goes on a rant about how I\u2019m so embarrassing and it\u2019s no wonder I\u2019m \u201cjealous of her being a mother\u201d and \u201cno one wants to have kids with me.\u201d \n\nI finally had enough. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have kids because I don\u2019t want them to come out like your rude pieces of shit\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re calling me an embarrassment? Didn\u2019t MJ just have a baby on you with his wife? Your baby literally has a sibling a week apart from her. You probably learned how to use chopsticks by eating his wife\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\nI guess when she was attacking me it was fine because everyone turned on me. \nIt got so loud that management had to get involved. Sarah was screaming and crying, MJ was yelling at me, and my mom and sister were berating me for being \u201cmean.\u201d \n\nManagement brought the bill and told us to please pay it and leave. My mom paid the entire bill but my sister said I\u2019m an AH for embarrassing Sarah and getting us kicked out - and how she\u2019s probably going through postpartum depression. \n\nNow\u2026idk if I went too far seeing as she\u2019s probably going through some post baby stress. AITA?\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThank you all for the overwhelming responses! I\u2019ve been wanting to put Sarah in her place for a while now - and I\u2019m glad I did! However, Sarah\u2019s Mom got involved and is mad at me. \n\nApparently, MJ told Sarah that him and his wife were separating. Sarah found out that he lied because she was secretly stalking his wife\u2019s Facebook page - and got the shock of her life when wifey posted a newborn baby and MJ was there for the birth.\n\nSarah did the math and realized that he got both of them pregnant the week of his birthday. She confronted him and he confirmed it. He also said that she\u2019ll have to get over it or he\u2019ll leave. \nSo, she stayed and is now constantly in shambles. Not my problem.\n\nNow onto the problem. \nShe kept the wife\u2019s baby a secret and only told her mom, who told my mom, who told my sister and I. So, they said that they were pissed because I wasn\u2019t supposed to repeat it. \n\nBUT I DIDN\u2019T KNOW IT WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. After like a week, that\u2019s all everyone talked about. \n\nSarah\u2019s mom (my aunt) reached out to me this morning and she said that Sarah\u2019s problem with me is that I always said I don\u2019t like kids and only a \u201chorrible person\u201d won\u2019t like kids - and that I was mean to her about her kids 2 months ago.\n\n2 months ago she wanted to go to a party with MJ and asked me to watch her kids. ALL THREE OF THEM. FOR FREE. I told her no because they\u2019re untrained, I don\u2019t feel comfortable watching a newborn - and she\u2019ll have to pay me to put up with the other two. \n\nSo, I guess that\u2019s why she\u2019s still holding grudges.\n\nRegardless, Sarah\u2019s mom said she was having a really hard time after finding out about the \u201coutside\u201d baby (who technically is the inside baby as Sarah\u2019s baby is the outside baby but whatever) and she wants me to apologize for putting her business out there for everyone. \n\nShe got my mom and sister involved so I just called Sarah and apologized. She just said \u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to say\u201d and hung up. \n\nRegardless. I held up my end of the bargain. Hopefully this gets blown over soon because ya girl is TIRED.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25885"}

The original post, with a few details in the comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_grieving\\_husband\\_if\\_he\\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita_for_asking_my_grieving_husband_if_he_has/)\n\nSo, as you all suggested I sat husband down and asked if he was okay, if he had the time and mental space to talk to me, etc. I apologised for what I implied- said it was inappropriate, irrelevant, and it wasn\u2019t my place to say anything on his relationship with B.\n\nBut then he broke down, to my confusion, and started apologising to me. Said he DID have feelings for B, that I\u2019m not delusional and stupid, that he\u2019s just been gaslighting me (I disagree). Not going to give all the details, but hubby found out after B\u2019s death that B had feelings for him - and it turned out to be mutual, to his shock. He said the sudden loss and what he realised basically made him go into a very dark place where he felt unworthy of everyone, including his children, B, and I. He needed to talk about it but was terrified of losing us.Knowing my husband, I kind of saw it coming and regret that he\u2019s only confessed to it now because I never would\u2019ve resented him for loving someone. And B\u2019s gone. It\u2019s just a lot of heartbreak for everyone.\n\nSo\u2026 I insisted on therapy again and husband agreed. And he\u2019s okay, thankfully. He did have way too much on his plate but he\u2019s already faring much better now that he\u2019s finally opened up. I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for being trapped in a cycle of self-hate after all of this. He also mentioned his parents\u2019 deaths too, very briefly. This all felt liberating because we finally came back to our before, where we\u2019d share and discuss everything freely.\n\nOne surprise though, is that I ended up being diagnosed. *I am* depressed. TBH, I\u2019m still puzzled because I come from a traditional Asian family where depression is a myth. But I guess I\u2019d never questioned myself because I was just always too busy to. Parents abandoned me when I was 5, became a barrister at 21, worked 80 hours/week, taking care of my kids, charity work\u2026You know what's the funniest part? I\u2019m extremely lazy. Every second I *fight* the urge to lie down somewhere and sleep forever. I have these random moments where I question the relevance of it all but they all seem insignificant in light of everything I could lose. I\u2019m okay. I never felt like reaching a breaking point. My husband has been feeling guilty - so I slapped some sense into him and told him I\u2019m not cancerous.\n\nWe also had a talk with the kids. My oldest has been radiant since then. Youngest also likes to follow my husband around like a baby chick now. I\u2019ve become an in-house counsel, so twice as less work hours, which is really cool too haha.\n\nYeah, idk. A lot of changes but none of them feel overwhelming! Life might be a bitch (esp now) but I feel grateful. Yes, I sound like a cheesy moron.\n\nThank you so much for your help, everyone!\n\nEDIT: I might not be able to reply to every single one of you in the thread, but I want to make sure to thank you all for your support and wholesomeness. I'm genuinely touched. And thank you for the awards, kind strangers!\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25879"}

Co-worker said something like \"so this is the lovely wife I've heard so much about\". I said something like \"thanks but we're not married\". He said \"oh, Boyfriend always calls you his wife\", and then introduced himself, I introduced myself, then ended the conversation and left as quickly I could while still being polite because both Boyfriend and Co-worker were giving me a weird vibe.\n\nA little while later, Boyfriend came out of the office and asked \"what was that?\". I didn't know what he meant so I asked \"what was what?\". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.\n\nThis somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.\n\nHe then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.\n\nI then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and \"no fucking way am I doing that\", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: We talked.

When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. \n\nMy ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. \n\nWe never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.\n\nNow, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. \n\nHere's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. \n\nThe other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying \"mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!\"\n\nWhen my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man \"daddy\" and that I needed to make her stop.\n\n I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife \"mommy\". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her \" Mommy \" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. \n\nThe next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. \n\nMy husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him \"daddy\"?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25849"}

He can\u2019t change that since like I said, it\u2019s all attached to my email.\n\nI recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical.

Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d \n\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \n\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \n\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \n\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \n\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far?\n\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did.\n\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. \n\nAnd to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25789"}

I went through exhausting period while I was nearing my due date. I was experiencing discomfort and wanted my husband by my side when I go into labor but he'd go out every night to hang out at his friend's place and watch football games. I suggested that he play/watch games at home just in case but he was having none of it and said he had to attend game night at his brother& friend's place along with his buddies. He said they had certain... How can i describe it? \"rituals?\" when watching a game and he can't enjoy doing it at home or anywhere else.\n\nThe night of our son's birth my water broke while my husband was at his buddies place watching a game. I called him and told him to get home and take me to the hospital he said he was coming but he didn't. I ended up calling my sister (she lives nearby) and she took me to the hospital. My husband showed up 2hrs later after he kept calling asking if I was still in labor and that he was almost done watching the game.\n\nHe was able to make it on time for our son's birth but I was furious with him, mad and disappointed. He apologized profoundly and has been working on regaining my trust and respect for him after what he's done. He's otherwise very supportive and involved in our son's care.\n\nLast night I was at my in-laws house for dinner and we were talking about my son's birth date. My husband suddenly started \"recalling\" what happened that night and basically started lying about driving me to the hospital, waiting and feeling stressed out and standing on his feet for so long without food or even water. I was confused I said no! none of this was true, none of this happened in fact, he was watching a game when I went into labor and I wanted him to drive me to the hospital but didn't show up til 2 hours later. My mother in law who takes no shit from anybody and whom everyone *fears* lost it on him yelling asking him if that was true and he kept quiet. she started berating him left and right telling him to sit down and shut up when he stood up to argue then told him to stand up when he was sitting arguing. Everyone was laughing at how she basically treated him as if he was a boy in trouble. She kept saying \"Shame shame shame! on you, this is not how I raised my children to treat their wives, Jordan you are a disgrace and I'm disappointed because of what I heard about you\". He literally swallowed every bit of his mother's berating and didn't say anything til we got home where he went nuts saying I made him look neglectful, a bad husband and father by telling the family about where he was and said I shouldn't have said anything but I argued it wasn't okay for him to lie and play hero in front of his parents. He said I just caused a rift between him and family and asked if I was happy now.\n\naita? Should I have not said anything?\n\nEDIT to say that he's done similar things in the past since he's a major enthusiast of football and hockey but I didn't expect it to get to that. Also this is not our first baby together, we have a 4 year old son.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25771"}

I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.\n\nEvery year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.\n\nI asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.\n\nI thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to! If you'd feel inclined, I think it would be pretty cool to donate it instead to a cool charity of your choice instead.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25761"}

I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.\n\n\nMy father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\n\n\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \n\n\nWhen my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n\n\nI put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.\n\n\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25752"}

Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.\n\nMy husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )\n\nI would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.\n\nIt's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. \n\nYesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.\n\nToday I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.\n\nTLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.\n\nEdit: to answer questions that people have been asking.\n\nYes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.\n\nYes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25751"}

Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.\n\nI always felt kind of \"different\" from the others because I'm not very \"geeky\" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.\n\nWell, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is \"Harry Potter\" themed.\n\nDue to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.\n\nExcept the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said \"It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.\"\n\nI was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.\n\nI said \"I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.\"\n\nShe was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of \"chasing popularity and doing my nails\" maybe I would have more in common with them.\n\nI'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.\n\n**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were \"too advanced\" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were \"dumb books for vapid little girls.\"\n\n**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25720"}

The people who told me I was TA said that because she would regret that decision.\n\nWe shaved her head almost a month ago. Just a few nights ago she asked me to shave it again for her since she really liked it. I was more than happy to do it.\n\nI do plan on buying her a wig or two off of Amazon before she goes back to school in case she regrets it and wants to wear it to school but take it off at home.\n\nI just want to make it clear - my husband's side of the family (her dad) was fully supportive (after all, her cousin inspired her to do it) I'm also spending less on shampoo and conditioner (she had super long hair)\n\nAs for my side of the family who was upset about it - some of them had a change of heart after she talked to them herself and told them that she was really happy with her decision. The other few think that she was forced to say she was happy, but I don't care.\n\nMy mom, who was the one who forwarded the picture to my family, apologized. She told me she did it because she thought she looked adorable but should have asked me first. But she was supportive of us.\n\nMy daughter wants me to let everyone know that if you really want to shave your head, just do it. According to her, she loves the way it feels on her pillows (she has silk pillowcases) and she liked feeling the shower and rain on her head.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25697"}

I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.\n\nShe calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave.

Seeing him living off fast food motivated me to learn to cook his family's common meals. It took me a while to get it done properly but now I can cook an entire list of his favorite meals. he praises my cooking and encourages me to learn more.\n\n\nWhile we were eating dinner at his parent's house. I had to excuse myself to go wash my hands after I was done. I left the table and my husband was still eating. as I was making my way back I heard his dad tell him to take it easy because he was eating a lot. he then asked my husband if I cook for him and if he eats well at home. My husband said that I do cook for him but the food I make can only be fed to pigs not humans. I was hurt and so offended. I showed up infront of him and told him I will no longer be cooking for him after this comment. He was turning in his seat as I walked right past him, took my purse and said I was headed home. He got back later saying it wasn't like that and that even if it was then I should be happy he still eats my food when it's still \"not perfect\" yet. He said he was trying to protect my feelings and I hurt him when I said I won't cook anymore.\n\n\nEDIT ~ Hi. I'm sorry I posted this then went out. I only read few comments and felt hasitant to respond but now I'm overwhelmed. Just wanted to let you (those of you who are interested in more details) that my husband is staying with his dad right now because I didn't cook. he said he thought I overreacted and that I wasn't actually going to basically \"starve\" him by going through with my \"threat\". I told him he could stay there all he can after he said he won't be back til I go back to cooking but I don't see that happening anytime soon. He can stay there, no pressure.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25681"}

They're both on great terms and I have to say her parents are a bit much.\n\n\nSo the engagement party was held at a restaurant. I drove my wife, Rowan snd his best friend Jack there because Rowan's car needed some work. Things went quite well, party ended and everyone went home.\n\n\nOn the way back, I had to stop by the store so my could grab something for our 16 year old son. Rowan, Jack and I waited in the car. Rowan and Jack kept laughing then this young lady walked towards us cause her car was parked next to mine in the parking lot. Rowan kept trying to speak to her while she was trying to load her stuff in the car. he and jack kept throwing words at her and she sermed annoyed. Jack then said \"hey, he just wants to look at that a**\" then Rowan said \"Let me see it jiggle, baby\" I was appalled, I told them both to knock it off but then Rowan satcastically replied \"Relax I was just giving her a compliment, bet she don't get many of those often\". The lady got in her car and I started arguing with him about his behavior and shamed him for acting like this on his own engagement night. He argued back saying something about my car and I lost it. I told him to get out immediately, Jack got involved so I kicked him out too. My wife got back and started engaging in the argument sayingI can't let her son walk home from his emgagement party, I replied that her son can't be harrassing other women on the way back from his engagement party but she kept defending him. I told her to either stay or get in the car. She did and I drove off.\n\n\nRowan didn't come home and my wife gave me hell for it. we later found out that he was staying at one of his guy friends place. From what I understand, he's pissed at me and refusing to see me. My wife said it was my fault, I escalated the situation ober some stupid shit boys his age do all the time. I told her he can't do this while in my car but she took it as in I was holding it over his head. She said I should've never made him walk the night his engagement and demanded that I apologize to him.\n\n\nwas I AITA for kicking him and his friend out of the car on his engagement night?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25674"}

Also, in case you\u2019re confused by the ages, we\u2019re 1.5 years apart, but I skipped a grade so we were in the same grade for nearly our entire life. Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he\u2019d say things like \u201cOnce I\u2019m at H....\u201d or \u201cAfter I go to H, my plan is...\u201d. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. \n\nJake and I got along pretty well, we\u2019d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He\u2019d refuse to study together, look over each other\u2019s essays, and he\u2019d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. \n\nThen, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. \n\nI once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for \u201cshowing off\u201d, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. \n\nHonestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it\u2019d get better after the summer, once college actually started. \n\nIt has not. Now it\u2019s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he\u2019s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. \n\nMy classes start soon, so I\u2019ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We\u2019ve always both worn headphones, there\u2019s literally no distraction. He just doesn\u2019t want to see me taking classes at H. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking done, I just want to be proud that I got into this college and actually learn shit without my brother screaming at me about it. \n\nWhere IMBTA: We got into an argument, and  I told him that of course he got rejected since H didn\u2019t take toddlers. I\u2019ve also been wearing my H sweatshirt around the house constantly, which he gets angry about. He kept bothering me, so I superglued H rejection letters in the drawers of his desk, so he has to see them when he opens them.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25636"}

So I said in my original post that I might update and well, here it is.\n\nOriginal Post -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iocvnp/aita\\_for\\_wearing\\_my\\_gfs\\_hoodie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iocvnp/aita_for_wearing_my_gfs_hoodie/)\n\nSo this actually happened a week or two after my original post but we've had a few unrelated family issues going on and I haven't been able to post.\n\nLike a few of you suggested, I did wear my gf's clothes at the next gathering. Nothing major, just some cute high heeled boots, her pink sweater and a pair of her jeans. She also painted my nails a beautiful shade of pink and helped style my hair. Let's just say, by the end of it I wasn't looking like a stereotypical \"manly man\". Not that there's anything wrong with people that do like more masculine clothes. My gf had also decided to wear jeans and a button up shirt (just to annoy SIL).\n\nAnyways, we went to my parents and immediately got glares and rude comments from SIL. The comments started about how \"if I want to be the woman in a relationship so bad then I should just go back to being a f\\*g\" etc. There were a bunch of comments before this but she got annoyed when we ignored them in favour of having an intelligent conversation with other family members.\n\nThat was the comment that really got to my parents though, it was partly the comment and partly the fact that my brother didn't do anything other than laugh. I've told them to stay out of it as my brother has a history of stopping their contact with my nephew over stupid things and they have enough to worry about. I'd bullied a bit in the past for my sexuality and my brother never stood by me. To him it was my own fault, if I didn't want to be bullied then I should've stayed in the closet.\n\nMy parents freaked out and all the anger and resentment towards my SIL that they had built up for the past few years came pouring out. They told her how they really felt about her and how they are disgusted that my brother could allow someone to treat his own brother like crap.They told them to leave and SIL is no longer welcome in their home until she apologises. My brother tried the threat of preventing them from seeing their grandson but they were done with him and threatened to get a lawyer involved. They now have scheduled visits (though now it's video calls as the rules are more tight again). I feel bad that they're no longer talking to my brother but they've assured me that they'll be okay.\n\nHonestly this turned into my parents being badasses rather than myself or gf doing much (other than looking absolutely fabulous). Either way, I'm glad that we won't have to see her for a long while. We blocked her everywhere after this incident due to the angry messages/voicemails we were getting. I know this probably isn't the update a lot of people were hoping for but it's brought my family some peace of mind and I'm happy with that.\n\nEdit - Okay holy crap this blew up. Seriously thank you for all the amazing comments and awards. I've been trying to read all the comments, sorry that I can't reply to them all.\n\nI've seen a lot of people asking about my nephews visits with my parents. It was not done through a court. It is literally just a plan that my parents and brother came up with so that they can have regular contact with my nephew without speak to his parents. As for the lawyer question. Honestly I do not know everything about how it works, I'm going off what my parents have told me. \n\nWe live in Scotland and technically grandparents don't have automatic legal rights to their grandkids. They can, however, get a lawyer involved and the courts can decide if contact with grandparents is best for the child. Due to the fact that my nephew is a bit older now there is a good chance they could take his opinion into account. \n\nI hope this sort of cleared this up for you guys.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25638"}

When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she\u2019s been mine ever since. She\u2019s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.\n\nWhen I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. \n\nAt first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I\u2019m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he\u2019ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn\u2019t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I\u2019m always rushing around her.\n\nThen last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I\u2019ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she\u2019s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn\u2019t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. \n\nSo I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I\u2019m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful \u2764\ufe0f\n\n[Update here](https://www.reddit.com/user/nohorsethrow/comments/snfhxm/update_aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_horse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25627"}

I work a full time job while he does a 3 times a week night shift. We have a 2 year old and I'm 6 months pregnant.\n\n\nThis whole drama started days ago. My husband has a large family. And on every Christmas they'd gather at his father's house. My father in law passed away a year ago and This year my husband decided as the man of the family to host Christmas at our house. Unbeknowest to me, he sent out invitations for a 5 day Christmas celebration to his entire family which are about 26 members in total.\nI found out about by accident and I was too shocked to react. I confronted him on it and he said I shouldn't be surprised and just get used to it because after his father's death he's now the family's \"head\" and all major family events will be held in our house and in his presence. I freaked out and said no this is wrong and he should've talked to me first before sending out any invitations to his family knowing I have other commitments like work and taking care of the house and our son. He said we'll manage if I took time off work but that means more workload later and it'd take away from my maternity leave. I demanded he cancel the invitations but he refused saying \"over my dead body\" then walked out. I ended up sending a mass text to everyone who recieved an invitation explaining that we will not be hosting Christmas this year. He found out and went off on me calling my behabior outragously appalling and said that I  broke his word to his family and made him look small and with no authority. I in a very strict tone replied that I didn't sign up to host a celebration and accomadate 26 people while pregnant, taking care of a toddler and working. And I don't care if he became the head of family after his father's death because it means nothing to me. He took offense to that and walked out almost crying.\n\n\nHe later talked about how I disrespected his father and him with what I said and demanded a hand written apology for cancelling the event and for being insensitive towards him and underminning his authority infront of his family but I said no apology from me in any form and the issue is still up especially with my MIL giving me a stern talk about how out of line I was for disrespecting my husband's decisions regarding the holiday celebration with family.\n\ntldr: my husband invited his family without telling me so I cancelled and he wants a formal apology.\n\n\nETA to put this out there he planned on sitting and telling stories of his dad while I handle everything and his family believe that as guests it's rude to ask them to help.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25620"}
{"text": "You are a Reddit post generator.\nUser: \nSubreddit: /r/AmItheAsshole \nAuthor: [deleted] \nMedia: text \nTitle: AITA for celebrating my anniversary despite what happened at my wedding? \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nMy husband and I had our wedding last year. The venue was beautiful and bordered a lake. Unfortunately, during the reception, one of the young children snuck away from their parents and decided to...go for a swim, despite not being able to. This was tragic and devasting, and obviously cut the day short. \n\nWe haven't really spoken to the parents since then, as we weren't close to them aside from seeing them on holidays, which haven't happened this year. We are still Facebook friends though. When our first anniversary came, I made a post celebrating our anniversary with a few wedding photos. I didn't think anything of it, until the comments came flooding in. I woke up to 30 comments and 15 missed calls. The top comment was from the mother of the child, who was outraged about it. \n\nShe wrote a very long comment about how my post was disrespectful of the tragedy that had happened that day and how dare I post that and not mention her child (and of course talking to her first). 30 comments later, and it was clear that the entire family had clearly started to take sides in a battle I didn't realize I created. As of today, we're at 150 comments. My friends and my parents are involved too.\n\nHalf of his family is screaming for me to take it down, apologize to the parents, and show more respect, possibly by even celebrating our anniversary on a different day. Some of the family think that we should still be able to celebrate our anniversary on the actual day, but just keep it offline to \"keep peace\". I don't think I did anything wrong with my post, and I feel like we should be allowed to celebrate our anniversary just like anyone else. I'm not celebrating the tragedy, I'm celebrating my wedding. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI have changed the post to only be visible to me and deleted all comments to try to stop the arguing, but from the email we just received, those comments were just a symptom of a larger problem. \n\nMy mother in law sent us an email with, from what I can tell, roughly 3/4 of my husband's family cc'd on it. His parents, grandparents, and the parents of the child are not only in the \"different day\" camp, but they are also demanding a **second wedding**. According to them, they've \"kept their silence\" for so long due to shock and being distracted by everything else going on this year, but they feel that \"because of what happened\" we aren't \"really married\" yet in the family.\n\nThey \"understand that weddings are expensive\" so they [husband's parents] offered to completely pay for this second wedding that will be the \"real\" wedding in his family's eyes, and because it may be a year or two before this can be done safely, they will \"tolerate\" us \"living in sin\" indefinitely due to \"the circumstances\".\n\nMy husband hates arguing with his family, and I'm not sure how I would even approach this with my family without being laughed out of the room, so now we need to talk about what to do with this.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nI've never had this many calls in my life. My husband and I have tried to read through this and have gotten a chance to actually talk this out. We have avoided the subject for a long time because it is not an easy thing to think about and it is not like this year hasn't had stresses of its own. He agrees that while something does need to happen, it is a priority that they start and continue to acknowledge that we are in fact married. I have had a conversation with my parents at least, who were exactly as they always were, but they are now aware of the full situation, and while they still would not support a full second wedding, they understand that I have an exceptional situation and so something exceptional needs to happen. I replied to my MIL ONLY to a group zoom call with us, my parents, my husband's sister in law to set up that sets up all of their technology things, which will happen later in the day. \n\nI feel like I should address some things: \n\n1. I did send condolences and attended the funeral. By not speaking, I meant since the funeral. I mistakenly thought that would be implied. \n\n2. I am not heartless. I was trying to avoid the rules with the euphemism, and it is not an easy day or thing to talk about. I was trying to keep things to just what happened, which I can see coming across very strange over text. I am also aware that I write very formally but that's not something I can change. \n\n3. The pictures and caption didn't reference the wedding itself, and there is no lake visible in the pictures. I only used ones that had just my husband and I in them, and I have sent pictures of just the bridal party before. I never have or will post pictures of the reception.\n\n4. My husband and I are looking ideas of how to fix this.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25611"}

Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love.\n\nMy niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting. \n\nI had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off.\n\nThey agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts.\n\nWell I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones.\n\nMy prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron.\n\nThe worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized. \n\nI basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS\n\nSIL got between us and said \"what's done is done\n\n**im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!**\n\nI said no way, you're returning EVERYTHING\nJenny said \"Mom already sold most of them on marketplace\"\nI lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.\nHe brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.\nI told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.\nSo AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25600"}

I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home. \n\nRecently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office.\n\n\nLast week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually. \n\nI got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25604"}

I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.\n\nHe suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25573"}

I had a whole lifetime before. I ran marathons, climbed mountains, wrote a novel that was published and did moderately successful in the 00s, and have a MFA in creative writing.\n\nChatting with some folks in the neighborhood, we got to talking about our greatest accomplishments. When it came to me, Tom said \u201cOh, well we know what your greatest accomplishment is, obviously. You have three beautiful, well-behaved children.\u201d\n\nI was honestly shocked, and I said no, that\u2019s NOT my greatest accomplishment. He looked just as shocked, and I said what my greatest accomplishment is, and then said \u201cAnd by the way, I resent the assumption that having kids is my greatest accomplishment. You have kids, why didn\u2019t you say that?\u201d\n\nHe said how he didn\u2019t *birth* the kids, and how that\u2019s a miracle of life and all that gag-me shit. I just rolled my eyes and said \u201cLet\u2019s not boil women down to their biological functions, kay?\u201d\n\nJen, who has kids, chimed in and said \u201cWell, my kids are my greatest accomplishment. I can\u2019t imagine thinking anything else.\u201d\n\nTom looked super smug, others including other moms chimed in. All of the moms agreed their kids were their greatest accomplishment.\n\nI kind of stewed about it. After that, the woman who chimed in sent me a message asking me if I needed to talk to someone, and asked if I was depressed, because my statement was worrisome. She ended up reaching out to my husband to encourage me to get help, because it seems I\u2019m unhappy being a mom and that puts my kids at risk.\n\nAm I really the asshole here for thinking being a Mom isn\u2019t the end all be all of my life?

Thanks for all the feedback & opinions, everyone (even the ones who think this is fake. I sincerely hope you never meet someone like Anna in your life).** \n\n**Just some clarifications to clear the air:**\n\n1. **Why did I write this post? I've faced many Anna's in my life, but my comments about how its inappropriate has always been shut down (i.e., you're too sensitive/ they're just trying to be nice/ you're not being welcoming) by others (in other similar situations). It's confusing/ distressing, but I feel like Anna really hit my limit & I wanted to make sure that I'm not TA**\n2. **Is Anna white? She's of mixed heritage (Caucasian & African American). I personally feel like it added another sensitive layer in this entire mix & indirectly goes back to the point above**\n3. **Did I talk to her about this entire thing? I moved out of SEA to get rid of that 'you're not Chinese enough' mentality (I faced that from my own countrymen multiple times) & I don't celebrate Lunar New Year (thanks to those who recommended that term) outside of my home country for personal reasons (my family sucks & I don't have good memories attached to that holiday). I didn't think I would need to justify/ defend myself** ***again.*** **As for the separate incidences, not really (& that's my fault). I just told her don't do that again cause I don't like it. I should have explained to her why, & I accept responsibility for that**\n4. **How did she confuse kabuki masks & think hell notes were decoration? Based on what her bf said, she went to some Chinese website that sells everything & the translation was whacky so she just thought it was all the same**\n5. **The entire organ meat incident: she didn't expect me & SO to eat them raw. She expected SO & I to cook it cause she's seen me cook some herbal soups before (non had organ meat though)**\n\n**Hope that clarifies things for everyone!**\n\nHusband (28M) & I (25F) are ethnically Chinese from a SEA country living overseas. We rent a house with SO's college friend who moved his gf (Anna) in during lockdown & she's been with us ever since (with landlord's permission & she pays her share of bills). They're not Asians, which matters.\n\nAnna was initially nice, but started acting very weirdly a month after she moved in:\n\n1. Telling SO & I that we can practice our 'real' religion (which apparently is Buddhism, not Christianity even though SO & I come from Christian families). She even bought incense (which gives me migraines) & a random Buddha statue. We politely explained to her that we're not Buddhists, but she continued to insist & promised that she didn't mind.\n2. Telling SO & I that we can speak our 'real' language cause she overheard SO's family talking to us in a mix of English & Cantonese. I explained to her that I can't speak Cantonese (SO can) even though I can understand it. She was, for some reason, really disappointed in me & said that I was throwing my heritage away. Plot twist: my own father is only comfortable speaking English.\n3. Buying raw internal organs for SO & I to cook, even though we don't eat those. I told her we don't eat that (not our thing), & she was again disappointed. She told us she read that there were lots of nice recipes & maybe we haven't found the right one to remind us of home. SO told her he's never eaten it ever in his life, & I've never liked it. She was really upset, but had to toss it since no one was gonna eat it\n\nChinese New Year was when things got really really weird. She started ordering 'decorations'. I wouldn't mind, but she had ordered hell notes (the ones burned for deceased ancestors). I immediately told her to stop pasting them all over the walls because they were weirding me out. She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down. She got upset (again), but then ordered kabuki masks. I told her that those masks were not Chinese, & she just snapped. She started yelling at me that I should be helping her & not critiquing what she was doing. I told her:\n\n1. She never asked\n2. CNY is not a big deal to me, so I wasn't planning on decorating but if she had asked, I would have helped\n3. She never asked\n\nI told her I don't understand her fixation with us. She said she wanted to surprise me & SO, that we've been so 'colonised' we've forgotten our roots, & that we should be embracing our culture. I told her it was a nice gesture, but she needs to stop forcing stereotypes down our throats. She could have just asked & she's not being woke when she's getting everything wrong.\n\nShe burst into tears & brought in her bf. He understood where I was coming from, but thought I could have been nicer. SO stands by me, & now things have been tense, but I've been tolerating this for a while now & it was getting on my nerves.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25549"}

My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?\n\nTHIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.\n\nINFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. \n\nAs for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her \"stuff\".  She already has \"stuff\".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with \"stuff\".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.\n\nUpdate for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.\n\nUpdate for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to \"retire\" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week \"preschool\" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and \"bless\" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.\n\nLastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  \n\nI still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.\n\n\nUPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough \"things\" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on \"giving\" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a \"new tradition\" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.\n\nTo those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and \"not bothered to budget for it once it came\" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.

I own a house and he moved in with me. I run online business from home which allows me to live rather comfortably. \nA month after moving in, he quit his job saying how much he hated it and that he\u2019s going to try and do twitch streaming for a living. \nIm all for following your passion so I was supportive although surprised at the turn of events. I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.\n\nAnyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel. Sure, he\u2019s gaming all day but hasn\u2019t bothered to even try and create an account, he just games for pleasure. It\u2019s been 7 months. \nI\u2019ve had conversations with him suggesting he finds work but he keeps telling me that I\u2019m unsupportive and he needs time.\n\nHe wanted us to buy a bigger house together but I said that I\u2019m fine with my current one and that since he doesn\u2019t have a job, I don\u2019t want to get mortgage and be left with paying everything and he told me that if I found a real job maybe I wouldn\u2019t have financial problems.\nWe had a massive argument that night.\nNow, he\u2019s been hinting at needing new gaming laptop which costs a few grand and I\u2019ve been ignoring it so he asked outright for me to buy it for his birthday.\n\nI told him no that my fake job doesn\u2019t cover new laptops and he got really pissed at me, telling me I\u2019m selfish and am ruining his career.\nGranted, I can afford it to buy it but he really hurt me saying my business is not a real job despite me working my ass off. AITA for not buying him new laptop?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25544"}

One game used to be about doing things while my eyes are blindfolded. involving puzzles, ruby's cube, shaped objects et cetra.... We'd take turns to do it just for entertainment.\n\n\n\nJust a couple of days ago, he's been trying to get me to sign papers while wearing a blind fold. I refused to do it because he never lets me take a look at what I'm signing neither before or after. He says that he was just trying to see if I could leave the same signature everytime I sign but I couldn't help feel uncomfortable. I told him I don't want to play this game unless and until he shows me the papers first, he said \"nevermind then\" and stopped bringing it up.\n\n\nLast night, he tried to convince me to give it a try and even volunteered to go first, I asked if he was going to show me what I was going to sign and he made a face and said no, it's the rules and I should respect them. I refused and he kept on about how I keep acting worried and suspicious for no reason. he said I clearly don't trust him and he was hurt by finding that out now after everything we been through. We had an argument and I told him to drop it and not bring it up again, period. He was mad despite saying it was no big deal, he was obviously upset with me and kept talking about how I don't trust him and that I was out of line to assume or suspect anything from him like this. I might be paranoid but I couldn't help it. I do think I was ta to him after he stood by my side when my own family didn't even visit.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25542"}

My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone.\n\nSo I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it).\n\nAfter dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than \"I'm sorry you're right\" people will say \"Accept your judgment!\" and if I reply \"Thanks\" to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation.\n\nShout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote:\n\nLooks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies. Stop being bitter and leave her alone. You don\u2019t need to also be mean to stay single af as you already are.

Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.\n\nA few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.\n\nIt dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different?

Since many of you requested an update, here we go.\n\nTurns out some of you were right, my wife was in on it. I confronted her a couple days after I posted and directly asked her if she knew that her parents planned this. She broke down and confessed everything to me. MIL had been pestering her about baptizing our son nonstop and my wife finally caved. My wife has been working from home during covid while my job requires me to go into the office. My wife and MIL started doing zoom meetings with MIL's priest to start the baptism process. They lied to the priest and told him that I was ok with baptizing our son but didn't want to be involved. The priest allowed it and they started doing online baptism classes while I was at work.\n\nMy wife admitted that she planned it around our anniversary getaway and that MIL had somehow convinced the priest that her and FIL would be the only ones in attendance. My wife told me that I wasn't supposed to find out, but MIL couldn't keep her mouth shut for even one day about it. Their intention was to keep this from me permanently.\n\nI did contact the church to let them know the truth. I talked with the priest and he was surprisingly helpful. He said he would take the proper steps to make sure MIL is no longer welcome in their church and to reach out to the local parish to see what further steps need to be taken. I have yet to hear back from them on that. My wife and MIL are mad that I got her kicked out of her church, but I don't care what they think or feel anymore.\n\nThese people who I love and trust had betrayed me and I felt a range emotions I didn't know existed. My wife begged for forgiveness, but the fact that she didn't come clean on her own makes me feel she would have kept this from me unless I confronted her. She's willing to do therapy, counseling, whatever it takes. I don't know if I want to put in that work, I feel like there's no coming back from this.\n\nI contacted a divorce lawyer and started discussing what a divorce would look like and if there is any way I can add provisions to a divorce agreement that would keep my inlaws from seeing my son unsupervised. He's been very helpful but I have not given him the go-ahead to actually file for divorce yet. I feel I am still too angry about the entire thing to think rationally and want to give myself time to fully grasp what a divorce will mean for me and my family.\n\nMy wife and I aren't talking much. I pretty much go to work, come home to play with my son, go to bed, and repeat. I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I do know that without the support and help from people here, I don't think I would have the clarity I do now.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25522"}

In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n\nNow, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends.\n\nThis feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it. \n\nIn the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go?\n\nEDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we *really* aren\u2019t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also. \n\nThanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out\n\n(Edit: I have posted an update to my profile as my character count was too long)\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/_somethingorrather/comments/1367ffb/update_wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25510"}

I\u2019m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I\u2019ve never been able to get a loan I\u2019ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I\u2019ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I\u2019m there or when I\u2019m not. Since I\u2019ve been saving for this semester he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s been over I\u2019ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it\u2019s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn\u2019t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn\u2019t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I\u2019m yelling at him about my money he\u2019s acting all confused and like I\u2019m crazy. He comes over I\u2019m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he\u2019ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it\u2019s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They\u2019ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it\u2019s stressing me out even more and I hate that I\u2019m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I\u2019ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they\u2019ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don\u2019t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don\u2019t know what to do and I hate that I\u2019m contemplating doing this. I\u2019m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 25506"}

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \n\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\nI told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 81020"}

Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it\u2019s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you\u2019re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine. But in the real world, people who can\u2019t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don\u2019t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don\u2019t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people\u2019s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub\u2019s judgement of who\u2019s the asshole in a given situation. I don\u2019t know if the disparity is just because of reddit\u2019s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don\u2019t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you\u2019re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you\u2019re an asshole, well\u2026 there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they\u2019re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never seen this movie, but it\u2019s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole\u201d\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 80910"}

My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 72773"}

I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

She stays with us instead of a hotel, and always wants to go to expensive restaurants. She always conveniently forgets her wallet, or domes up with some excuses as to why she can\u2019t pay her share. She has implied that since I make much more money than her, I should be the one to pay (no, not my husband should pay, but me *specifically*). I do make a fair amount of money, but not so much that I can treat someone every time they come into town. Nonetheless, in the past, I have just paid the bill and asked her to pay me back. She never has. \n\nShe had made a reservation at an extremely expensive restaurant last night, and before we left, I made it clear that I wouldn\u2019t be paying her bill. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole, and I\u2019ll admit I got this move straight from and episode of Two and a Half men. As we were leaving, her and my husband went to the car. I pretended I forgot something and went back inside. I found her wallet sitting right on top of her suitcase. I put it in my purse and we went to the restaurant.\n\nWhen we were done eating, I asked for separate bills. She said no, we need one bill, because she \u201cforgot\u201d her wallet again. I reached in my purse and said, \u201cthis wallet?\u201d \n\nShe was extremely furious. She said that I should not have touched or grabbed her wallet. \n\nSo AITA for taking her wallet and bringing it to the restaurant?\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Jeez lol! So many comments that I can\u2019t keep up, but thank you to everyone who had something to say.\n\nEdit 2: Amy just called me, she saw this post and she yelled at me for \"badmouthing\" her on the internet. Honestly I don't care. Amy, hopefully reading all these comments is a wake up call for you.\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 69788"}

And I\u2019m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \n\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI\u2019m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven\u2019t reached out to any of Marcy\u2019s family and I don\u2019t plan to.

My coworkers who work weekends are: \n\nJames - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n\nAITA for this joke?\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 63531"}

However, a closer examination of his reign reveals that he may have been more progressive than history has given him credit for.\nIn fact, it's possible that Khan was one of the earliest proponents of women's rights in human history.\nOne example of this is Khan's policy towards marriage. When he wanted to form an alliance with another kingdom, he would often offer one of his daughters as a bride to the ruling monarch. This was a common practice among royal families at the time, but Khan had a twist: he would then send his new son-in-law to fight in the Mongol army, while his daughter took over the rule of the allied nation.\nThis may seem like a strange arrangement, but it had a practical purpose.

In 1916, there was a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have put all acts of war to a national vote.

The War Referendum Amendment also included a provision that anyone voting yes on the referendum would have to register as a volunteer for service in the United States Army. This means that if you voted in favor of going to war, you would automatically become eligible for military service yourself.\nThis amendment was never ratified by Congress, but it's interesting to think about what might have happened if it had been.

Here are some instances where Putin's handshakes made international headlines:\n1. The infamous Trump-Putin Summit\nDuring the summit held in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018, Putin and US President Donald Trump had a tense exchange of words. As they shook hands at the end of the meeting, Putin tried to show his strength by gripping Trump's hand tightly. The US president winced in pain but managed to maintain his composure.\n2.

In an effort to improve their image, they announced that they were donating $1 million to charities that support food insecurity and hunger relief. However, it's come to light that they spent $5.5 million on advertising the donation.\nThe company posted a video on Twitter featuring their CEO, Tony Xu, announcing the donation. The ad was broadcast during the Super Bowl and had a price tag of $5.5 million. The ad also featured a number of celebrities including actor Danny Trejo and NFL player DeAndre Hopkins.\nMany people have criticized the move as a PR stunt and have pointed out that the money could have been better spent actually helping those in need.

Save the Internet. \nWrite the Reddit post.\nAssistant: \nThe internet is under attack. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced plans to repeal net neutrality protections, which could have a devastating impact on consumers and small businesses alike. It's time for us to fight back and protect the open internet.\nNet neutrality is the principle that all data on the internet should be treated equally, regardless of its source or destination. This means that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot discriminate against certain types of traffic or prioritize some content over others. Without these protections in place, ISPs could charge more for faster speeds, block websites and services they don't like, and create \"fast lanes\" for companies that can afford to pay more.\nThis would have a chilling effect on free speech, innovation, and competition. Small businesses and startups would be unable to compete with larger corporations that can afford to pay for\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 201659"}

Now cable and phone companies are free to block, slow down, or charge for fast lanes for content on the internet. This vote was a complete disregard for public opinion, facts and the law itself. \n\nFree Press will be suing the FCC and fighting this in Congress in the coming months.

We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.\n\nOne of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.\n\n**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\\_wait\\_to\\_kick\\_off\\_my\\_seventh\\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)\n\n**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I\u2019d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I\u2019ll answer as many as I can later on.\n\n**Edit:** Although I would love to stay forever, I have to get going.

Why can't we have professional voice actors like in the old days? The use of celebrity voices is not only insulting to the art of voice acting but also takes away from the authenticity of the characters.\nLet me explain. When you watch a cartoon or play a video game, you expect the characters to sound consistent throughout the series or game. However, with celebrity voices, you get inconsistencies because the celebrities may not always be available for recording sessions. This means that the character's voice may change from episode to episode, which is jarring for the audience.\nFurthermore, professional voice actors bring a level of expertise and nuance to their roles that celebrities may not possess. Voice acting requires a specific set of skills, including the ability to modulate one's voice, understand\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 141381"}

And when you finally do, they greet you with their wagging tail and a loud bark. However, there's more to this behavior than just excitement. Dogs are intelligent animals who can be trained to perform specific tasks, including obedience commands like \"sit\" or \"stay.\" So if you want your dog to behave well and show off their skills, it's essential to invest time and effort into training them.\nOne of the most basic and important obedience commands is \"sit.\" It's a straightforward command that teaches your dog to stay in one place and wait for further instructions. To train your dog to sit, you can use positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats or praise.

However, today, I am feeling particularly inspired. Inspired to write about an experience that has been all too common for me lately - getting off the horse at the wrong time in Red Dead Redemption 2.\nFor those who have not yet played this game, let me explain. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an open-world western video game developed by Rockstar Games. One of the main features of the game is the ability to explore the vast landscape on horseback. The problem is, if you're not careful, you can easily get off your horse at the wrong time, triggering a cutscene that takes you out of the action.\nThis happened to me just the other day while I was trying to complete a mission. I was chasing down a bandit through the mountains when I suddenly found myself standing in front of a campfire, watching as\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 227166"}

Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. \n\nI've had enough. \n\n#boycottswbf2\n\n#boycottea\n\nEdit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry!

I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.\n\nAll I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  \n\nEdit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!\n\nEdit 4: EA have a pattern of this behaviour so I have added the boycott EA hashtag. \nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 182126"}

However, despite being able to lead a happy and fulfilling life, your Sims can still meet their end at any moment. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how the Grim Reaper sends good boys (and girls) to the afterlife in The Sims 3.\nIn The Sims 3, the Grim Reaper is a mysterious figure who appears when a Sim's time has come to an end. He typically appears in a black cloak with a scythe in his hand, ready to take your Sim to the afterlife. However, before he does, there are a few things that can happen.\nFirstly, your Sim may have a chance to say their final words to their loved ones.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team, which includes scientists from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), has produced a picture of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy Messier 87.\nThe image shows a bright ring surrounding a dark central point, which is the shadow of the black hole's event horizon - the point of no return where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape its pull. The size and shape of the ring are determined by the intense gravitational field around the black hole, which warps the fabric of space-time and causes light to bend and curve as it travels towards Earth.\n\"This is a historic moment for the ESO and the entire astronomical community,\" said ESO Director General Xavier Barcons. \"We have been able to observe the unobservable, and this will\nUser: How much karma did the post earn?\nAssistant: 134509"}
