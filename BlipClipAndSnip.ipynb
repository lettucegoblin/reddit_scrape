Because this is Reddit, we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \\(both of ‘em!\\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality.

Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up.

      "On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.\n",

      "Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What information was involved?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**\n",
      "   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.\n",
      "   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.\n",
      "* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**\n",
      "   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. \n",
      "   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.\n",

It is often used to justify the vast wealth disparities between the top 1% and the rest of society. However, what is often left out of this narrative is the fact that many of these wealthy individuals come from privileged backgrounds, with access to education, resources, and networks that are not available to most people.\n",

Will Guzzardi (D-Chicago) in response to reports of books being challenged or removed from school curriculums across the state.\n",

My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. \n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would \"go away in the winter\". \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Worst mistake I have ever made.**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. \n",

Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.\n",

I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she \"needs to think about what kind of man\" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.\n",

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning to repeal the existing net neutrality rules that protect our freedom and open access to the internet. This means that giant corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will have unprecedented control over what we see and do online. They could slow down or even block websites, throttle speeds, and charge extra fees for access to certain content. This would devastate small businesses, consumers, and marginalized communities who rely on the internet as a lifeline for information, communication, and commerce.\n",

We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. \n",

Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me \"No, this is what is expected of you every night.\" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like \"Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change\" and \"You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work.\" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked \"Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this.\" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that \"I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby.\" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. \n",

My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok.

At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn’t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there’s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "They got into counseling, for a year things were ‘ok’ on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fiancée around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn’t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid’s attended their father’s wedding. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was taken aback that I didn’t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she’ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*****ETA: First, I’d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can’t go back and undo that. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work…DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her…”He’s dead to me now.” Time will tell if he means that. I’m sure he’ll see this update too. For that reason, I’m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won’t be dead anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "His mom told him, “Your children have to be our number one priority.” They’re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he’ll understand this.\n",

      "I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of his friends asked about work and I said \"Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.\"\n",

      "I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer\n",
      "\n",
      "It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got irritated with his friends and asked \"Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?\" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying \"There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said \"at least they know I'm a rich bitch\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hzjbhx/aita_for_telling_my_wifes_friend_she_is_too_old/ My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like \"Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.\n",

I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me.

She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n",

      "\n",
      "She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n",

      "\n",
      "Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n",

A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \n",

      "I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.

      "\n",
      "Backstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a \"what was that\" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying \"Yeah, *I* purchased my house\". I asked \"does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues.\" She grinned and said \"it's just for the record\" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied \"Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you.\" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar \"my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way.\" My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Holy hell this blew up. Sorry I wasn't clear with my friends being 50/50, half think I'm NTA and the others think we're both assholes and I shouldn't have escalated the problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "She wanted me to eat with them because at her colleague's house his kids also ate with them. She didn't want to make a fuss about my autism because sometimes I'm rude when people ask about it. She said her head was all over the place all evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to her that that's why I could have made my own food. She said that was difficult because there was no time for that. I didn't realise because I'm not good with time awareness. I asked her to communicate with me next time and be more clear about what I can or can't do. She said she will and said I can help cook next time too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every comment said that her boss was nice. He probably wasn't angry or upset with her. I told this to my mum. She said sorry to me again because she wasn't upset at me at all. She was embarrassed because she tried to get me to ''behave normally'' and she shouldn't have done that. She took it out on me on a whim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also said sorry because I didn't realise that it could've been important for her work status. I just thought they were like friends. She said it was OK because I didn't make a big fuss and I didn't get loud or walk away. She's proud of me for staying at the table and also thinking about the ducks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We concluded that we both learned things. I learned things because I now know more about work dinners and manners. She learned things because she now knows to communicate and explain more to me to avoid stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the comments people also said her boss might have experience with autistic people. I asked my mum and it was a little bit sad. His little brother was autistic but he died 10 years ago. It made him sad because he loved him a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her I should eat things I like next time because it upset him to think mum was worried about appearances so much that I had to be uncomfortable during dinner. He also said that dinner was really good and that he's happy to have her in his team at work. He's a good person and a good boss. I sent him a thank you email with my mum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last thing is that I fed the ducks the peas. I think they were happy about it. The thing with ducks is that they don't say that to you of course. I got an ice cream with two scoops at the pond. I also got one for my mum because I had money left. It was a little bit melted when I came home because it was 5 minutes walking but she still liked it and she said I was amazing.\n",

She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. \n",

      "My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.\n",

      "She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can’t be flushed and that it’s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. \n",

For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course).

I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her.

I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me.

I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people.

Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. \n",

All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'.

I worked for this quilt shop for a year. I learned some things, got a break, and regained some of the mental health I lost. This cookie debacle was the push I needed to regain my self worth and go back to the field that I wanted to be in. Within a month I found a job as a pharmacist at a federal prison. I loved it from my first day. \n",

I found a job I love and a group of people who appreciate my baking and don’t use me as a cookie slave. Thanks, Reddit. You guys are awesome.\n",

I'm female 5'9\" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me \"slim\" and I even heard her say one time \"go ask toothpick\" and she has said stuff like \"you need some meat on your bones\" & \"you need to eat\". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. \n",

      "Today when she said \"morning slim\" I replied \"morning chunky\" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is \"different\" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a \"compliment\". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's \"a high school issue and we should figure it out\".\n",

I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.\n",

      "\n",
      "When I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.\n",

      "A couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, \"A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!\" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.\n",

He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

      "We thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be \"Tray\" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, \"This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence.\" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta.

Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, \"Her name is Daisy.\" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put \"Ray Smith\", Demarcus Jones would put \"Marcus Jones\", Keshawnda Nelson would put \"Shawna Nelson\", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.\n",

We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone. It's a family name on my husband's side.\n",

      "So, most of you told me that I should just voice out my support for the LGBT community instead of directly talking to my brother about his sexuality. This was very helpful as I did not want him to feel pressured to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I wrote my original post, I was already watching Schitt's Creek, which had non-straight main characters. This was really convenient because I could simply say remarks like \"Awww, they make a really nice couple\" and \"Wow, I wish my relationship with my gf was like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I also asked my bro about Pride month (he has been going to marches as an ally for the past few years with his out friends). I asked him \"Hey, what's their plan for Pride month during quarantine? Too bad they can't hold the march, I was thinking of joining.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't really know how to be subtle, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our parents went grocery shopping last weekend, that's when he told me. \"You already know, don't you?\" I knew what he was asking but I tried to play dumb. \"You know, that I'm gay, right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I just said yes, told him about the iPad incident, and hugged him. He cried and asked me not to tell our parents, which of course I agreed to. He then asked if this changes anything between us, to which I replied \"Of course, now you have to give me better fashion advice!\" (I make jokes when I'm emotional, okay)\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him he has my support no matter what, and that I can help him come out to our parents when he's ready. I also told him that he and his boyfriend (which he confirmed) are a great couple, then I reminded him that they should always be \"safe\" (Giving sex advice to my brother was VERY awkward).\n",
      "\n",

I was raised with values to love and accept everyone, regardless of gender/sexuality, so that will never change especially for my bro. Again, thank you for the overwhelming support!\n",

      "My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be \"the good ol' salads & appetizers\" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served \"salad\". my fiance made a face and said \"isn't that what vegans eat?\". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.\n",

      "UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to \"address\" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept \"acting dismissive\" of her son's input and \"contributations\" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying \"I paid for it\" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of \"my money, I paid for it\" mentality. She finally mentioned how \"bad\" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my \"weird\" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and \"the family\" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.\n",

      "\n",
      "I got in touch with my sister and asked her to meet up again at a park (no bill involved). I asked her if she was pregnant and she told me the truth. She said she wanted us to still be in each other’s lives and that she wanted me to be in her baby’s. A redditor (and I forget who, I’m sorry) mentioned that she may ask me to be the godmother and that person was correct. But as many of you pointed out — if I didn’t cut her off, I’d just become her bank and daycare employee. So I told her I could no longer be in her life. And I left her crying on a park bench and felt like the shittiest person in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I emailed my parents and told them how betrayed I felt and that I’d be cutting off contact with them. To my stepmom’s credit, she apologized. She explained that she never thought my sister would live to have kids and that she let her emotion over that get the better of her. Understandable. My dad said nothing, which is honestly what sucked the worst about all of this.\n",

I explained the situation and how I’d be distancing myself from my family. Some have made it an us-versus-them situation and as much as I appreciate the support, feeling like I’m in some valiant battle just makes me more tired. So I haven’t been talking to much of anyone in my family.\n",

      "A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.\n",

      "It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.\n",

      "However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc...

Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was \"probably\" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said \"Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry\". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't \"show up for dinner\" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said \"I don't know, maybe save some food for me?\" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life \"on pause\" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.\n",

How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**\n",

I know it was an invasion of privacy, but I clicked onto the emails. \n",

      "- Weirdly, some of you were really focused on the fact I kept the PS5. But I paid for it, have the receipts and it never left my home. I feel like retracting this gift he’s had little over a week as an asshole tax is morally justified after he’s been a 5* asshole. (And last time I checked this was a moral judgement not a legality sub?). …I think they’d be very different comments if this was the other way round and he’d just given me an engagement ring and then found out I was cheating not even 2 weeks later. Yes it’d be mine under the jurisdiction of a gift, but is it morally right I get to keep the ring? Probably not.\n",

On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom.

My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.

Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn’t say anything about it but then my husband couldn’t deny that she’d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. \n",

MIL also says I’m the asshole but SIL says I didn’t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.

She's been on it pretty regularly lately for the first time in years (historically, she's not really been into social media). Most people in our area/social circle have been posting really heavily about BLM and the protests happening right now, as well as racial justice issues more generally. As a result, Stephanie has now come into contact with a *deluge* of Karen memes for the first time, and found them confusing and horrifying, especially the use of \"Karen\" as shorthand for a racist. I've basically just declined to talk about it with Stephanie, because it went so poorly last time, but both *my* mother and *her* mother have hounded me about it because it's upsetting to Stephanie, and said things like, \"Is *this* what you were talking about before?

My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn’t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn’t even explain to me what was going on, just “you’re going to go visit gran for awhile” and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I’ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can’t have kids so they’ve always said I’m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first.

The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n",

So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own.

Many of you asked for an update, so here goes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Last weekend, the girls were at their mom’s. After she dropped them off Sunday night, my 12yo asked to talk to me in private. We went into her room, and she showed me two recordings she’d taken on her phone; one of my ex trying to convince them I was abusing them, and one of her and her husband arguing about how much she was paying in child support, and I’ll be honest here - my cousin is a family court lawyer and basically raked her over the coals. It wasn’t pretty, but I was still extremely hurt over the affair. I even got alimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, my 12yo told me she didn’t want to go to her mom’s anymore, but she said she felt she had to because she’s the oldest sibling and it’s her job to protect the younger ones. I’ve always instilled this value in her (I’m an oldest child myself) but seeing this just made me even more upset, because now it’s just another battle she’s fighting that she shouldn’t be. She’s also just started to figure out that her mom cheated, and over the past couple weeks she started firing tons of questions at me about the timeline of their relationship I couldn’t really answer, and after showing me the recordings, she literally demanded I answer her, yes or no, did her mom cheat on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t easy, but I told her the truth, with the promise she wouldn’t tell her sisters (as much it sucks, that’s my job, not hers). The way she cried on my shoulder was the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever experienced, but she was catching on and I figured if she’s going to find out regardless, it should be in a setting where she’s comfortable. After she was done crying, I told her to email me the recordings she took, and called my cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve just started the paperwork, but my cousin is certain we can get my ex nailed for parental alienation, and since she got a promotion a few months ago, I should be able to renegotiate the child support payments as well. Most importantly, the recordings should be enough to give me grounds for supervised visits only, which is what I want. I still want the girls to have a relationship with their mom (especially since the younger two still want to see her), I’m just going to have to make sure I’m present at all times when they’re with her. Coparenting is oodles of fun, kids! \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I also want to give a huge thank you to all the supportive comments and messages. I only saw most of the DMs recently because I use the Reddit is Fun app on my phone and for some reason it doesn’t show chatroom messages. I’m not the best with technology, seeing as my most valuable job skill is herding 5yos, but I wouldn’t trade it for any other career. Thanks for all your support, Reddit!\n",

      "So about 2 weeks ago I posted here asking if I was the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend for his guy nights. The post didn’t get a lot of attention but the attention it did get was controversial and there was a lot of differing opinions so I figured I’d do an update as a lot has happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "So after I posted I ended up contacting the girlfriends in the group to see what was up and we started noticing some fishy stuff. Their boyfriends and the guys in the group would say the exact same things to them as they did to me. Stuff like we’d invite you but then the other girls will want to come. We also figured out that there were other nights that all the guys were free but that wanted to do Saturday’s for some reason. One of the girls, H, was suspicious for this any many other reasons so she checked her boyfriends phone (I don’t condone what she did at all btw, but in this circumstance I excuse it). While looking she found a group chat called “boys night” which she had never heard of. She was super suspicious at this point and clicked it to be greeted by a bunch of very interesting messages from the boys in our group. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well guess what? Turns out “guys night” was really “go to a pub and cheat on your girlfriend night”. The message was in reference to one of the girls my boyfriend was sleeping with last week. In fact, all the other guys except one were cheating, while the other knew but kept quiet. Another lovely discovery from the chat was that he hasn’t been using protection with the other women or with me (birth control), meaning not only has he been cheating he has also been putting me a high risk of an STD, while also risking mine and my elderly grandfathers life because of COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say we’ve broken up and I feel better for it, but right now I’m friendless, single and waiting on STD results which doesn’t feel fantastic. \n",

      "\n",
      "Edit 2: Thankyou again for all the kindness- I just thought I’d add a few things. 1. Covid isn’t bad where I am (Aus) but when we hang out we social distance with masks- you can’t social distance during sex which is where my fear of covid comes from 2. One of the girls dumped her boyfriend (who wasn’t cheating but knew) and the other took him back (he was cheating) and finally 3. I’m STD free!!! I got a call an hour ago and am so completely relieved- now I can start to move on.\n",

      "She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that \"she always pictured her son's bride in it\" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type.

      "She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and \"turned down\" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked \"what process?\" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom.

I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him.

Matter of fact, she hasn't reached out to either one of us since then (we also didn't reach out to her). Unfortunately, B's words from that day really got to friend A. She struggled with survivors guilt and questioned her upbringing/lifestyle, views on religion, etc. She doubled her therapy sessions and I spent my free time keeping her company.   \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks ago, I went over to her place and found her reading a bible and (almost obsessively) flagging pages. She said she was researching to check if what B told her was true. She started reading excerpts and telling me her interpretations. This behavior did scare me a bit, so I suggested she bring this up to her therapist (it was the only thing I could think of to help calm her down). She did talk to the therapist who suggested she perhaps talk to a pastor instead of trying to come up with her own conclusions. She asked me to go with her, which I did, but told me to just wait for her at the church while she talked to the pastor privately. After, she said that she felt better and was more convinced that B was full of it. She also seemed calmer, so I believed that conversation did help her. \n",

I tried to reassure her again and talk through her feelings, but I could tell it was still eating at her. I had a feeling she might spiral again. Then I had an idea. I told her about the post I made on here and explained why, how it works, etc. (she's not a Reddit user). I pulled up my original post and asked her to read the comments to show her how hundreds of people (religious and non-religious) felt about what was said. We spent the evening reading each comment, she cried, she laughed, she was surprised and overwhelmed at the amount of support and reassuring words from all these strangers. I could tell she was more and more relieved as we read. She has been in a much better state of mind since then, so seeing hundreds of people disagree with B's words definitely had a positive impact on her. \n",

I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was \"cooler\" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like \"fatass\" and \"chubster\". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).\n",

I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not).

I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn’t then I’m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I’m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said “those people don’t understand our relationship or Leah”. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she’ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can’t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She’s locked herself in our room now. I’m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn’t know this but her parents said it’s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn’t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn’t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone.

I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn’t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn’t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said “I don’t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don’t remember”.

Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I’m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it’s her best friend and that wasn’t fair to do to her in our house. I said it’s a pattern and since Erica’s stuff isn’t affected she doesn’t care. I said she can go over to Leah’s if she wants to see her. She said she can’t do this because Leah doesn’t like her apartment and Leah’s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable.

So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \n",

I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded.

I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care.

Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John’s parents AND his childhood best friend “Dan” and his wife decided to move here as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a “distanced picnic” at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to “jokingly” rip on him for being “whipped” and doing “my” job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be “allowed” to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how “mean” I was for not “fixing him a plate” and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families \"do it right\", where they handle the “outside chores” while their wives handle the “inside chores” (including the care of Dan and his wife’s two children). I think it’s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have “outdoor chores”, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to “go for a walk” and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for “making \\[him\\] look bad” in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how “a traditional division of labor” is “a huge part of southern culture”, and how I was being “disrespectful” to his background by “forcing northern culture” onto him and his family. He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how \"southern hospitality\" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. \n",
      "\n",
      "John is livid and says his \"culture\" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not \"compromising\" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his \"culture\" was \"Islamic or Asian or whatnot\".\n",

      "I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say \"OK I get it\" and \"I won't do it again\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\n",
      "He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it.

Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there.

The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down.

One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running.

Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did.

On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her.

She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! \n",

      "So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n",

He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back \"like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?\"\n",

He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child.

I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding.

His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that.

I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable – and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/logumz/aita_for_accidentally_calling_out_a_new_colleague/ Last week a new colleague \"Cathy\" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far \"exotic\" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy then jokes about how all this \"no travel business\" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was \"at a native speaker level\" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy \"oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!\" (\"oh fun, we have something in common then!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she \"couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it.\" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added \"which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!\" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said \"whatever\" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting \"superior\" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a \"little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues\" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?\n",

I didn't know \"exotic\" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft \"g\" lol.) \n",

We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their \"traditional feasts\" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son.

My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away.

I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother.

She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’.

During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again.

When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.\n",

It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming.

John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.\n",

      "The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack.

It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.\n",

      "I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me.

My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. \n",

I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hvzvwg/aita_for_not_forgiving_my27_fiance28_for_missing/ My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only \"friend\" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\\*\\*\\*\\* and a c\\*\\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\\*\\*\\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.\n",

We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments.

      "2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. \n",

Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said \"neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it.\" She decided to leave.

We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.\n",

As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \"fair\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\n",

What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\".

      "So I thought of what everyone said and considered both sides. I decided that I didn't want this hanging over my head in our marriage. So it was tough, but shortly afterwards one night I had a few glasses of wine and told him I had something I needed to talk about. I had considered seducing him, having sex and then telling him so I could at least do it one last time but decided that would be manipulative and dishonest. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I sat down and told him: When I said I had \"a lot\" of sexual partners it was over a stint of about 4 months as an escort.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was taken back a bit and said \"That's not something I'd expect.\" I figured no one would, I dress modestly, I'm pretty conservative with drinking and I volunteer with the kids programs at my church.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had tears in my eyes and asked him if his opinion of me had changed. He said \"Well what you did didn't stop you from being the woman I fell in love with so why should it?\" I started crying more...tears of joy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I begged him to let me know if he had any apprehensions or questions or if it'd come between us in any way. He said he might have questions about any cool or sexy stories sometime but for now no. He even made a quip about \"No wonder you blow my mind in having sex, you were a professional!\" Not really the type of joke I'd normally appreciate but in that time it was perfect. And we ended up going to the bedroom not too much later.\n",

      "\n",
      "I responded that my time at the school wasn’t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked “I’m sensing that you’re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said let’s focus on the story, and she was like “Actually this could be a better story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said y’know what, sure. Whatever. I don’t owe the school anything, I’m not being paid, and even though it’s been a long time and I’ve grown from what happened, it’s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I’d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn’t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me “Moolly” for the rest of the year and when I yelled “MY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY”* she had me suspended for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went “viral” but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the “Moolly” incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I’m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can’t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven’t changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time ago, yes. I don’t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?\n",

      "I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her.

      "At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. \n",

      "Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more.

I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me.

      "I hired a lawyer and given all the details on my side. My lawyer said she needs my unedited manuscript for the book and my SIL's published book along with the copy SIL sent to have it proofread and edited. Because the published book has different parts changed, my lawyer needs the unedited version which SIL should still have in the transaction she did with her editor and proofreader. We took the risk to ask SIL for the unedited copy she sent to her editor & proofreader despite the chance of having her feign \"I don't remember their names, I don't have their contacts anymore, I don't want to, etc.\" I told SIL that we will go through the route of having to use third-party notarization to ensure no foul play on either part (have 1 individual look at my unedited manuscript and the one she sent to her hired editor + proofreader).\n",

It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me ‘are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?’ to ‘are you a gypsy?

Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they’ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I’m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she’s focusing on her career, she’s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. \n",

She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers.

I am a 30 year old white woman with thick curly brown hair (3c if you know what that means).  I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with.\n",

She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice. \n",

When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.\n",

I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she’s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week.

My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her \"house\" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.\n",

I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.\n",

I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.\n",

I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tb6ywm/aita_for_teaching_my_20m_niece_4f_to_say_el/ Uh basically title I guess. My sister has a habit of saying \"you know what really gets my goat\", she probly says it 7/8 times a day. So like that tumblr post i taught my niece to say \"el chupacabra\" when her mom says it (it sounds more like \"eh supacaba\" tho cause shes four but its adorable). I told my niece it was a monster from Mexico that eats goats and she didnt seem scared or anything, probly cause the only monster she knows is cookie monster, but apparently now my niece walks around the house saying \"el chupacabra!\" all day and now my sister & brother in law are mad at me for teaching her this, but imo its kind of adorable and also harmless?? But like shes my sisters kid so idk.\n",

According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read “welcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)” and this is where things go down hill. \n",

We can just send your parents the pictures later.”\n",

So this was her breaking point. \n",

Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. \n",

By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So.. AITA?\n",

I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying \"shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?\" then walked out.

So, I wend to the bachelor party in Maine, I rented the tux, and paid for mine and my wife's dinner at the rehearsal dinner.

I was also NOT allowed to include anyone but the two of them and no inside jokes or stories about my buddy that didn't include her.\n",

This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out.

Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills.

He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for \"being cruel to my brother\" and \"abandoning family when they need help\". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I \"understood the right thing to do\" before hanging up.

I have read all of your comments, and thank you once again. I am in tears and became an emotional mess after reading your thoughtful responses, thank you for the love and support. I have always felt as some sort of emotional burden to my friends, so thank you for your encouraging messages and telling me to keep my head up high. Even though we are all strangers on the internet, it sort of felt like I had gained new family. My heart goes out to the people who have messaged me privately of their experiences with losing their loved ones to drunk driving as well. Please know, I have felt your pain, you are not alone in this and I wish you all the love in this world.\n",

      "Now for the update, I did what some of you suggested and called my other friends to let them know what Amy had asked of me. They were quite livid and angry for me as they had no idea what Amy was planning for the wedding, we arranged a zoom call with her the next day to discuss why is she being so insensitive to me. Well, the call was quite the battle. It started off calm, then Amy just blew up. You guys were right when you said that Amy was jealous of the attention that I had received during the time of my family’s death anniversary, her wedding was a way to shift the attention towards her. She tried to explain to us by having the wedding on that day, it will turn a negative situation into a positive one. When she realized she wasn’t convincing enough, it felt as though a mask had fallen from her face and she started yelling and insulting me. She said that she is tired of having to play the supportive friend role and that it’s been 7 years, I should just get over it by now or go join my family in the ground. My friends lost their anger and called her every name in the book. I am honestly just shocked and disappointed at the person who used to be my friend. It breaks my heart knowing I lost another person in my life, but I guess you guys are right in the sense that she never really was a friend. I now look back at our friendship and realized it was often one sided on my part. I wish it didn’t take me so long to realize it. No one in our friend group of 6 people are going to her wedding now. We have decided to go no contact with Amy and block her on all social media. My friends have offered to go visit my family’s graves together with me, I accepted and we are now planning to also make a scrapbook with my family's pictures. For once I am actually looking forward to this day, and will start to plan more eventful activities like this.\n",

I don't think I deserve the awards you all have given me, thank you kind strangers. Some are asking about Amy's fiancé and his thoughts, we haven't heard anything as we still haven't even met him. We tried several times to meet him last year, but something always came up. I guess we'll never know his true feelings.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c03hb1/wibta_if_i_started_calling_my_white_coworkers_by/ I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Chuck: Thanks, Tiana\n",

      "Tina: No problem, Chad!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT #2:\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \"Tiara\"\n",

Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.\n",

      "My husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull \"Carl is a widower\" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.\n",

I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits.

I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again.

I decided not to go to HR right then, but I did take the advice to write down what happened, with the time and the names of the other colleagues present just in case. I thought the situation might blow over, because Cathy was probably just embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I was wrong. Cathy kept being cold to me, rolling her eyes at me in meetings and talking behind my back. Another colleague came to confront me at one point to ask me why I'd been so mean. Apparently Cathy was telling a different version of what happened. Cathy said that I'd said mean things to her in Dutch and was making fun of her in Dutch, so no one else but her could understand. She was smart enough to only tell these stories to colleagues who weren't actually there for it. Word got around and it turned into a bigger issue, with a couple people actually questioning my character, mostly just colleagues that don't work very close to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "HR got wind of it after a while and I got called in close to a month after the incident. They had already met with Cathy and she'd told them the \"she cursed me out in Dutch and was very mean to me\" story. I told them the full story and everything that happened after. They asked me if there was anyone else present who could confirm this, so those colleagues came and told them that Cathy had lied about speaking a language, stormed out and then started calling me a b-word etc. to others. They thanked me for my time and I got on with work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing happened until a week later when I was informed that Cathy was asked to leave. Apparently Cathy had doubled down on the lies and told everyone I was the one lying and she did speak those languages, so my boss told her in that case she'd have no problem talking to one of our Canadian colleagues (who wasn't involved in the situation) in French in front of him, just to confirm. At this point Cathy admitted she had been lying. It turned out she didn't speak a word of French either, or Norwegian, which was the third language she was lying about. This was enough for them to let her go, because part of the reason they hired her was that they were so impressed by her speaking multiple languages and work experiences she'd had abroad. The work experiences were made up as well.\n",

She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy.

She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then.

She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her.

Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc… I spent thousands of dollars.

      "I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?\n",

      "3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.\n",
      "4. Online he announced that I \"pushed out a dark skinned baby\" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.\n",
      "5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.\n",
      "6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a \"Welfare Princess,\" and how I was going to be just another \"baby mama.\"\n",

      "First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before.

One of the words was \"Chanukah\". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to \"Hanukkah\". She said to my daughter \"you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?\" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah.

      "The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive.

      "So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said \"Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become.\" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking \"how me and my dick knows about that\". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole \"women get looser\" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this.

I grew up in rural landscape and I’ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it’s not an issue.

Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they’re doing, and that’s when I see it.

I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it.

      "We’ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it’s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I’ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we’re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won’t talk to us now. My mother says I’m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn’t have to deal with the house shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to add that we completely respect each other’s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn’t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can’t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don’t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We’ve told her we’ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule. \n",

      "Sunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn’t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. \n",

      "He told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. \n",
      "He thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. \n",

      "My dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. \n",
      "\n",
      "She choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won’t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. \n",

      "Apparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. \n",
      "\n",
      "But he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don’t have the support we got this time.\n",

His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.\n",

Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?\n",

She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/degzhj/aita_for_insisting_if_i_cant_have_my_partner_over/ Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \n",
      "\n",
      "About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\n",
      "\n",
      "ETA: some questions people keep asking: \n",
      "1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and \"just do\". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. \n",
      "2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) \n",
      "3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.\n",

I also mentioned how I shouldn't have to wait for him to be away to dance, bake or listen to one direction just because he doesn't like it. He tried convincing me to stay but I left.

I told him I wanted to move out and maybe after a while, if he does actually change, i'd give us another chance. I just needed some space to think about things and so I told him we should take a break from each other for a while. Nate told me he would talk to his mom as well and that he should have defended me to which I said yes you should have.

I wasn’t okay with this as I don’t trust the school to not lose it (i know they’ve lost/broken other students’ phones) plus I don’t want them having access to my daughter’s private info. I went to the school and requested it back, saying I wouldn’t give it to my daughter but I paid for it. Secretary gave me the spiel and I didn’t blame her but asked to speak with the vice principal. He comes out and repeats them. I said okay but I’m the parent, I paid for it and I never signed anything giving you permission to hold it. They were refusing so I said I’d sit in the office until it was given back. I did so and waited for close to 2 hours. Finally the principal came out and said I needed to leave. I said if I left, I’d be back with a police escort. At that point, the phone was returned to me.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cvlkut/wibta_if_i_told_a_close_family_friend_that_her/ So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \n",
      "He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. \n",
      "\n",
      "As stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n",

Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. \n",

      "Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later.

      "\n",
      "He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” \n",
      "\n",
      "He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).\n",

      "\n",
      "Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.\n",

The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” \n",

      "Edit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation.

She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. \n",

      "Now for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. \n",

She got defensive saying that birthdays are no \"excuse\" to show favoritism and that her daughter is \"watching\" and \"observing\" how I'm treating both girls.

He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon.

He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them.

I told them I couldn’t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state.

      "\n",
      "1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad’s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I’m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he’s the generation after mine in our family tree and it’s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it’s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don’t care, and my family’s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it’s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don’t know how after this situation). \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he’s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son’s safety. I didn’t know how he would react and followed my cousin’s lead, but wasn’t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n",

Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking… then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it’s at the point that if I don’t order this dress in a couple of days it won’t be here in time.

The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride’s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn’t remember the shade name but its a “dusty purple” then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was “mulberry.” On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.\n",

So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was “look, I don’t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.”\n",

He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn’t have missed much since he probably won’t enjoy any of the “festivities” anyway. They’ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he’s been ignoring but he thinks they’re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.\n",

      "Thanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color “flint” one in “mulberry.” The MOH was setting me up to believe “mulberry” was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a \"mulberry\" dress.\n",

      "I caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress.

Let me call her and see if there’s anyway to make it right, and if not I’ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.” I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. “My friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds!

The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn’t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.\n",

Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n",

When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating.

She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into \"streetwear.\" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?\n",

      "I think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.\n",

Anyways, I decided to take your advice, and here’s an update on the situation, for anyone that’s interested!\n",
      "\n",
      "So after reading a ton of your comments, I decided to call Joy and invite her over to talk. Luckily, she said yes (by the way, before this, she didn’t say she didn’t want to be at my wedding, so she was still planning on becoming a guest), and I apologized for kicking her out with no warning, but I laid out my frustrations. She apologized for being really picky about the dress and realized that the attention wasn’t going to be on her and it wasn’t her day, so it wasn’t really appropriate for her to get upset over fine details on a dress. She also revealed to me that this was going to be her first time being a bridesmaid (she doesn’t usually wear dresses, she’s more of a leggings and sweatshirt type of girl). I took some of your guys’ advice again and asked Joy to show me a couple of dresses online she would be comfortable with (didn’t matter what color, I just wanted to see her style), and she searched for about 10 minutes and couldn’t find one that she “loved”. She kind of looked bummed and a little apologetic, so I came up with a plan. The official dress shopping day for the bridesmaids was the next day, and I invited Joy to go with us, to get a feel for the dresses, to see if she would be comfortable. She agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the next day, my girls and I met up at a dress place, tried on a couple of dresses, and Joy didn’t really like them, even though my other bridesmaids did. Finally, we tried on the 4th dress, which was THE one. The girls fell in LOVE with it, and I looked at joy and she was staring at herself in the mirror, but she had a smile on her face! :) I came up to her and told her again I didn’t mind if she wore a shawl or cover up for some moments, and she nodded and smiled again. Actually one of my bridesmaids (who didn’t really know about the situation) came up to joy and told her how gorgeous she looked in the dress. I’m not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears because they all looked so beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we found a dress that was matching and all the girls were happy with, and Joy is back in the bridal party. Hope that this was a happy ending that everyone enjoyed :) Now for me, I have to go to plan other parts of the wedding with my fiancé:)\n",

He told me that he said to put him on as an insurance beneficiary partially as a joke but then when I \"went off\" on my tangent (including offering up that he'll never go on my house title either even though he never mentioned it) that he got offended and reacted poorly. He said he really did think I was going off about all that in retaliation for his \"no to marriage\" talks so he was left with a bitter taste. Which...I get. I can be more forceful than I realize and I am naturally passive aggressive. He said I didn't have to put him on anything but he needs me to understand that I am it for him.

I turn and there he is with a ring. I said yes.\n",

      "HR meeting call with supervisor went well. The main incident in my original post wasn’t recorded but all six colleagues wrote a statement confirming what Sarah had said and how inappropriate it was. I didn’t realise but John had also asked others who work with us if they, at any point, heard Sarah attack my character or physical appearance in a cruel or improper manner and if they did, would they be willing to write a statement. Apparently, she has been saying quite a few outrageous things behind my back and it seems that a lot of the hurtful office gossip about me did originate from her. I submitted a few examples of messages and emails, sent by Sarah during work hours, taking jokes about my appearance too far. I also included the messages where I asked her to stop causing attention at work as I’m extremely uncomfortable with others regarding me in that way. Her claims of my bullying her and calling her flat chested and ugly at work were dismissed as she couldn’t specify dates or find anyone to corroborate her story or even provide any examples of me ever being hostile or unprofessional. The phone call we had after the video team meeting where she claims I used threatening language against her was also disregarded as no recording was made and it was her word against mine; Luckily, I don’t think they believed her on this point as I’ve never displayed anything near the type of agressive behaviour she was accusing me of and my character references had me down as the quiet sort who gets on with work. \n",
      "While things were being reviewed, Sarah decided to quit. She’s still adamant that I bullied and threatened her and felt no choice but to leave the toxic environment I created. I’ve been reassured that there was no wrongdoing on my part except that I should’ve reported things much sooner when inappropriate comments first started. From what I gather, Sarah’s general behaviour at work has raised concerns for a while and I wasn’t the first to complain about her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some people were confused as to why I had considered her a friend in the beginning. When I joined the team 3 years ago, it was my first job out of uni and I was incredibly nervous but Sarah was the first to ask me questions and offer to hang out. She was a bit overbearing and rambunctious but I appreciated her efforts to get to know me and coax me out of my shell. We often did have a good laugh despite her sometimes making a joke at my expense but I tried not to take it to heart and occasionally reminded her to wind it in and be more considerate of my feelings. It’s only been during the past 8 or so months where she’s become especially rude and callous. I still referred to her as a friend of sorts but I never thought she would take things as far as she did.\n",

      "Despite the misery at work I had to go through for a while, everything has turned out pretty amazing. I do love my job now that I can actually get on with it without the office drama. Finding out how my other coworkers feel about me has been incredibly reassuring and we’ve now set up a weekly virtual pub night. My outlook has improved massively and I’m taking steps to manage my anxieties and put aside past negativity.\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d31cjt/aita_for_calling_my_bodypositive_coworker/ I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ftum7d/aita_for_buying_a_50000_guitar_for_4000_and/ This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he \"looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair\". I texted back, \"I'll take it for $4,000\" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, \"well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask.\" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to \"sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam.\" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: \n",
      "\n",
      "Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would \"do bad things\" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vbay7f/aita_for_making_my_sil_feel_like_shit_about_her/ 35F and my SIL is 46F. I have 3 children, the oldest being 16M. For my birthday last week my son went out and bought me this swinging hammock chair that I had been wanting for 2 years and it cost him quite a bit of his saved money (which I fully intend to put back in to his bank account so he can continue saving). He was so excited to see me open this gift and couldnt wait to help me set it up. I told him he shouldnt have, that it was a lot of money and his response was \"You never get anything nice. I wanted you to have it.\" And it was true. I usually dont get anything for my birthday or Christmases outside of Tupperware or soaps. So it might sound stupid but I have cherished this swing ever since he got it for me, especially where I finally have something nice that's mine. \n",
      "\n",
      "My SIL comes over once a week to see all of us and she immediately headed straight for my swing (which my son hooked up on our deck). I told her to please not sit on it and she said \"Is there a weight limit?\" So I told her yes, 250lbs and I even showed her the box to confirm. She was not upset about this. She just said \"That's a bummer, they need to make something capable of holding us big girls\". I simply agreed with her and went about my business. At this point my husband shows up from work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went inside to grab us some drinks her and my husband are talking on the porch and not even 5 minutes later I hear a loud crash and my husband say \"Fuck, are you alright?\" I go out and sure enough she had sat in my swing and the crochet netting around the hook snapped on one side, causing her to fall right on her ass. She is sitting there laughing, gets up and says \"I guess i need to learn to listen.\" So I lost it. As I said above, I literally never get anything nice. Never. This is the one thing that I had that was mine and it didnt even take someone a freaking week before they ruined it for me. So I said \"I literally just fucking told you not even 20 minutes ago that it would not hold you and to please not fucking sit in it.\" She makes some comment about \"Usually the weight limit is a lie. I thought it would hold.\" So I said \"The weight limit probably would have held if you were only 50lbs heavier than it, not 150.\" (She is 420ish lbs because she is one of those girls who eat food on camera for money and she absolutely loves her weight). But regardless, instead of apologizing or offering to compensate me for my destroyed item, she has resorted to saying I'm a shit bag for making her feel like her weight is a problem and my husband is on her side. \"Its just a fucking swing\".

I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n",

My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled.

      "Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn’t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn’t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex’s fault. He took a paternity test. \n",
      "\n",
      "The poor baby girl was NEVER my ex’s. The coworker apparently was dating this ‘terrible’ guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn’t know who the child’s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he’d be the best father for her child. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He’s doing pretty bad now and I can’t help but feel guilty like I should’ve told him.\n",

      "EDIT: I didn’t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I’m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I’ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn’t after everything that happened between us. They’re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should’ve. \n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: So here’s what’s been happening right now, I haven’t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex’s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing ‘people who were never really family’ over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn’t biologically his, she’s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex‘s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won’t contribute to that but he says that he’s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).\n",

Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it.

Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.\n",

      "This led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me \"disrespecting him\" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.\n",

      "I know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents.

I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. \n",

      "I used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. \n",

I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now. \n",

This was part of a \"puppy package\" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\n",

      "4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.\n",

The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to \"let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding\". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.\n",

Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my \"duty\" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was \"blindsided\" by me.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pjk1u/aita_for_calling_him_a_fucking_embarrassment/ I've been seeing my fiance for 4 years now and I came in to the relationship with 2 boys. My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n",
      "\n",
      "We get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hd7upi/aita_for_cutting_off_my_mother_when_she_got_a/ I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.\n",

      "Last week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her \"special little guy\" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.\n",

When SIL was pregnant I made it clear that I’d only babysit for them in the case of a serious emergency, e.g. someone has a medical emergency. I won’t babysit if they just wanted time off from being parents, because I don’t have the free time for that. I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it’s me. \n",

I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike’s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again.

Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike’s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I “gave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie”. \n",

First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school.

My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n",

At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more.

Because I know sh\\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/db9dtn/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_niece_our_dogs_room/ For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n",
      "\n",
      "In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n",
      "\n",
      "And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ur722/aita_for_pulling_my_daughter_from_a_waterpark/ My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys. \n",
      "\n",
      "I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?\n",

      "Second, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.\n",

Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/opctna/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_was_out_of_her/ My (36) sister N (29) got pregnant at 18. I am infertile and knew I couldn't have kids so when N said she was giving her baby for adoption, I decided to be her mom. N went no contact 5 months after giving birth. For a bit of background, N got pregnant by a one night stand and she apparently didn't remember or know the father at the time of birth but when V was 2, a man T (35) messaged me on social media claiming to be the father of my child. N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life. I got too emotional and hung up. T came home from work and on explaining to him, he was beyond furious. I then got a call from my parents saying I was an asshole for telling N she couldn't she her baby. I said I never said that and I welcomed her to bond with V but they refused to listen and said I was being insensitive and harsh and flaunting my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now feel bad because me and N were very close as sisters and I feel quite close to her situation since I know the struggles of infertility. T said there was no way he was letting my sister have full time and I agree but I want to know if am the asshole for being too harsh and telling her about T.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit - I did legally adopt V at birth. T adopted her too after we got married. N never wanted kids and I feel the only reason she wants V now is because her husband wants kids. I don't know but I think this is it and T agrees.\n",

My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like \"I prefer pink over blue\" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm \"emotionally stronger\" than her. \n",

However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. \n",

I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has \"Euthyrox\" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.\n",

      "My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic \"I should apologise since I'm more mature\".

He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).\n",

      "edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not \"trying harder\" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator.\n",

We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It’s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it’s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We’ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It’s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn’t impact how I see him. \n",

It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah’s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was “making eyes” at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We’re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.\n",

Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn’t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn’t feel like a joke. I told her “if you seriously can’t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you’re not welcome here anymore. You’re 30, act like it. Get out.”\n",

My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.\n",

They have 4 kids (F10, M8, M5, F3) and she’s pregnant. My sister works a full time job (40+ hours a week, cleans her entire house, cooks, takes care of all her children without him doing ANYTHING. It is seriously mind blowing that she wakes up at like 4 am, cooks breakfast, does chores, gets all of her kids ready for school, takes them all to school and daycare and all he does is stay home and work and when his kids get home (after my sister picks them up of course) he will play with them for a little and play video games until he falls asleep. she actually makes MORE than him! My fiancé (M 26) and i had to stay with them for 6 weeks while our home was being renovated and since we both wfh, we helped her and it is AMAZING how much happier she is when she has help. I helped with the kids and my fiancé even drove her to doctors appointments. Her husband literally only acknowledges he is a parent when his family is around, then he is a god fearing, hard working, father of 5. he is the one that wanted more kids, she wanted to stop after her last baby but he “needed more boys”. I am seriously concerned not only for her, but her kids as well because now her oldest is seeing what’s happening and trying to help but my sister is prideful and refuses to let her child do anything. \n",

Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he’s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him.

Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.\n",

C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating \" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now\" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of \" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me.\" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane.

I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast.

The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\n",

My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\n",

She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, Anna has very thick, blonde and curly hair that my wife adores. Ever since she was a toddler, she'd spend hours doing her hair every day, braiding it, straightening it and styling it in all sorts of ways. Our bathroom cabinets are always filled to the brim with a bunch of hair lotions, oils, creams and other fancy products I don't even know the names of. So I think it's more than fair to say that my wife's a bit obsessed with the whole hair thing. Anna, however, has never been too fond of getting her hair done, or of anything that involves having to sit still for more than a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before she got it cut, her hair used to reach past her waist. And while it looked lovely, she hated getting it brushed and every morning used to be a screaming fest between her and my wife. Lately, she'd been begging for a shorter haircut. My wife ignored her whenever the topic was brought up in hopes that she'd forget about it, but none of that ended up happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think Anna realized she was getting nowhere with her mom, because she started asking me to take her instead. I was reluctant to at first because I didn't know how my wife would react, but I agreed when I saw just how excited the kid was over something as simple as a haircut.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yesterday I drove her to the hairdresser, where she got to flip through a lot of magazines and pick a picture of a haircut. And when she chose a really short clipper cut, I knew I was gonna be in deep shit with my wife. At that point though, there was no turning back. I mean, what could I have really done? Told her that no, she can't get the haircut she was so over the moon about, all because her mom wouldn't like it? I couldn't do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went ahead with the haircut, and by the end of it Anna couldn't stop smiling. She went around the salon showing it off to everyone and even asked me to take a bunch of pictures even though she normally hates having pictures taken of her. We did get one rude comment from an older woman at the salon, something along the lines of 'You can't even tell if she's a boy or a girl now', but Anna was way too excited about her hair to notice, and if she did notice she didn't care.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my wife got home from work that day though, things quickly took a turn for the worse. She refused to even look at Anna, locked herself in her room and cried then got in the car and drove off. It's been a day now and she's still not back, it's honestly starting to worry me. I knew she wouldn't react well to the haircut but I wasn't expecting her to take it this badly. The kid's upset too and no matter how much I reassure her she still thinks she's in trouble for getting her hair cut. \n",
      "\n",
      "AITA? I realize how attached my wife was to Anna's hair, but at the end of the day I still think it's just hair. The kid's old enough to decide these things for herself and she was really happy with the haircut, so I don't think I did something wrong here.\n",

Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can’t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. **She’s in therapy and is working on it.**\n",
      "\n",
      "First program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn’t understand why the other child wasn’t punished for it. This daycare didn’t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming “one of those moms”. \n",
      "\n",
      "We chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn’t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won’t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn’t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled. She said at this point, she will only be responding at specific times of the day and not looking the rest. The owner then added sent several pages of the contract with passages highlighted, reminding us of certain policies my wife had violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget.

      "\n",
      "I (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to \"toughen\" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet \"hooks\" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just \"toughen\" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not \"needles.\" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a \"needle.\" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.\n",
      "\n",

Let’s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We’re not best friends but we are friendly. We don’t really spend much time together.  \n",

I didn’t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don’t owe the style and she’s free to wear what she likes but it’s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.\n",

      "But then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I’d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. \n",
      "I joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. \n",

      "I deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it’s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.\n",
      "She kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it’s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she’s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?\n",

The house keeper started swearing on her children that she didn't put it in there and had no idea how it got there....I believed her and figured Jeremy had something to do with it given his history. I switched my attention towards him and had him explain to me exactly how he saw our house keeper do it. He told me what he saw but a friend of his came forward and said that he saw Jeremy put the jewelry inside the lady's purse and was trying to get her in trouble.

A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.\n",

I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n",

I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said \"Okay\", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.\n",

I even have temporary stickies I can put on the \"toes\" to make it look like I painted my nails. It's actually really cool!\n",

I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it.

However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.\n",

      "We helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn’t complain about why she “had to be there\" to look after Opal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.\n",

      "Kelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well.

      "The school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child.\n",
      "\n",
      "We already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal’s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were “so busy!” with life right now.\n",

      "Kelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.\n",

      "Kelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into “sides.” The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don’t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.\n",

We will be taking Opal on a mall trip to make up for what happened at the celebration dinner.\n",

      "We spoke privately to Opal after this incident and she knows we in no way view her as a burden. Our granddaughter is a blessing and many of our happiest moments involved supporting Opal and watching her grow up.

      "The biggest problem is that Kelly is now an adult and needs to start acting like one. Kelly is supposed to outlive us.

He has two daughters. Annie who is now 26 (I believe) from his first marriage and Amy who is 17 from his second. My husband told me about his late wife, his ex wife, the issues he had as a blended family when he remarried and Annie was not on board with him remarrying and the fact this strain ended his second marriage. He was also honest that Annie never forgave him for remarrying and never wanted anything to do with Amy or him after she turned 18.\n",

      "The story as I now know it. When Amy was around 5 years old she took a special interest in a necklace that belonged to his late wife. My husband gave the necklace to Amy, which upset Annie, because all her mothers possessions were meant to go to her. My husband told Annie that it was just one item and she needed to get over it because Amy was entitled to have something too. Annie had brought up that it was the piece her mother wore the most. My husband told her that it was a special gift to give to her sister. That she was being selfish. His ex wife told her that her mother would want \"someone as special as your sister\" to have a piece of her as well. Annie never got over it. She tried to take it from Amy and was punished. The last time she saw any of them she told them all to go to fucking hell.\n",

I told him he should be ashamed of himself. That he should have allowed Annie's mothers possessions to be hers, to do with as SHE chose, that Amy did not give a crap about his late wife or the significance of those items, but Annie would have. I told him he will be incredibly lucky if his daughter ever speaks to him again and I would not blame her if she never did.\n",

The original post, with a few details in the comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_grieving\\_husband\\_if\\_he\\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita_for_asking_my_grieving_husband_if_he_has/)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as you all suggested I sat husband down and asked if he was okay, if he had the time and mental space to talk to me, etc. I apologised for what I implied- said it was inappropriate, irrelevant, and it wasn’t my place to say anything on his relationship with B.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then he broke down, to my confusion, and started apologising to me. Said he DID have feelings for B, that I’m not delusional and stupid, that he’s just been gaslighting me (I disagree). Not going to give all the details, but hubby found out after B’s death that B had feelings for him - and it turned out to be mutual, to his shock. He said the sudden loss and what he realised basically made him go into a very dark place where he felt unworthy of everyone, including his children, B, and I. He needed to talk about it but was terrified of losing us.Knowing my husband, I kind of saw it coming and regret that he’s only confessed to it now because I never would’ve resented him for loving someone. And B’s gone. It’s just a lot of heartbreak for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "So… I insisted on therapy again and husband agreed. And he’s okay, thankfully. He did have way too much on his plate but he’s already faring much better now that he’s finally opened up. I wouldn’t blame anyone for being trapped in a cycle of self-hate after all of this. He also mentioned his parents’ deaths too, very briefly. This all felt liberating because we finally came back to our before, where we’d share and discuss everything freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "One surprise though, is that I ended up being diagnosed. *I am* depressed. TBH, I’m still puzzled because I come from a traditional Asian family where depression is a myth. But I guess I’d never questioned myself because I was just always too busy to. Parents abandoned me when I was 5, became a barrister at 21, worked 80 hours/week, taking care of my kids, charity work…You know what's the funniest part? I’m extremely lazy. Every second I *fight* the urge to lie down somewhere and sleep forever. I have these random moments where I question the relevance of it all but they all seem insignificant in light of everything I could lose. I’m okay. I never felt like reaching a breaking point. My husband has been feeling guilty - so I slapped some sense into him and told him I’m not cancerous.\n",

I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "This somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.\n",

      "He then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.\n",

      "My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\n",

      "So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \n",

      "When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n",

      "My brother Jake (18M) and I (17F) had the same dream college, H University. Also, in case you’re confused by the ages, we’re 1.5 years apart, but I skipped a grade so we were in the same grade for nearly our entire life. Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he’d say things like “Once I’m at H....” or “After I go to H, my plan is...”. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jake and I got along pretty well, we’d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He’d refuse to study together, look over each other’s essays, and he’d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for “showing off”, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it’d get better after the summer, once college actually started. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has not. Now it’s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he’s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. \n",
      "\n",
      "My classes start soon, so I’ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We’ve always both worn headphones, there’s literally no distraction. He just doesn’t want to see me taking classes at H. \n",

      "\n",
      "Like a few of you suggested, I did wear my gf's clothes at the next gathering. Nothing major, just some cute high heeled boots, her pink sweater and a pair of her jeans. She also painted my nails a beautiful shade of pink and helped style my hair. Let's just say, by the end of it I wasn't looking like a stereotypical \"manly man\". Not that there's anything wrong with people that do like more masculine clothes. My gf had also decided to wear jeans and a button up shirt (just to annoy SIL).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, we went to my parents and immediately got glares and rude comments from SIL. The comments started about how \"if I want to be the woman in a relationship so bad then I should just go back to being a f\\*g\" etc. There were a bunch of comments before this but she got annoyed when we ignored them in favour of having an intelligent conversation with other family members.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the comment that really got to my parents though, it was partly the comment and partly the fact that my brother didn't do anything other than laugh. I've told them to stay out of it as my brother has a history of stopping their contact with my nephew over stupid things and they have enough to worry about. I'd bullied a bit in the past for my sexuality and my brother never stood by me. To him it was my own fault, if I didn't want to be bullied then I should've stayed in the closet.\n",
      "\n",
      "My parents freaked out and all the anger and resentment towards my SIL that they had built up for the past few years came pouring out. They told her how they really felt about her and how they are disgusted that my brother could allow someone to treat his own brother like crap.They told them to leave and SIL is no longer welcome in their home until she apologises. My brother tried the threat of preventing them from seeing their grandson but they were done with him and threatened to get a lawyer involved. They now have scheduled visits (though now it's video calls as the rules are more tight again). I feel bad that they're no longer talking to my brother but they've assured me that they'll be okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly this turned into my parents being badasses rather than myself or gf doing much (other than looking absolutely fabulous). Either way, I'm glad that we won't have to see her for a long while. We blocked her everywhere after this incident due to the angry messages/voicemails we were getting. I know this probably isn't the update a lot of people were hoping for but it's brought my family some peace of mind and I'm happy with that.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ski42q/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_horse/ Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. \n",

      "So I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?\n",

I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️\n",

Unbeknowest to me, he sent out invitations for a 5 day Christmas celebration to his entire family which are about 26 members in total.\n",
      "I found out about by accident and I was too shocked to react. I confronted him on it and he said I shouldn't be surprised and just get used to it because after his father's death he's now the family's \"head\" and all major family events will be held in our house and in his presence. I freaked out and said no this is wrong and he should've talked to me first before sending out any invitations to his family knowing I have other commitments like work and taking care of the house and our son. He said we'll manage if I took time off work but that means more workload later and it'd take away from my maternity leave. I demanded he cancel the invitations but he refused saying \"over my dead body\" then walked out. I ended up sending a mass text to everyone who recieved an invitation explaining that we will not be hosting Christmas this year. He found out and went off on me calling my behabior outragously appalling and said that I  broke his word to his family and made him look small and with no authority. I in a very strict tone replied that I didn't sign up to host a celebration and accomadate 26 people while pregnant, taking care of a toddler and working. And I don't care if he became the head of family after his father's death because it means nothing to me. He took offense to that and walked out almost crying.\n",

He agrees that while something does need to happen, it is a priority that they start and continue to acknowledge that we are in fact married. I have had a conversation with my parents at least, who were exactly as they always were, but they are now aware of the full situation, and while they still would not support a full second wedding, they understand that I have an exceptional situation and so something exceptional needs to happen.

I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.\n",

His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night.

She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down.

There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. \n",

We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her \"stuff\".  She already has \"stuff\".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with \"stuff\".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.\n",

      "\n",
      "Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to \"retire\" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week \"preschool\" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and \"bless\" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.\n",

      "UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough \"things\" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on \"giving\" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a \"new tradition\" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.\n",

She broke down and confessed everything to me. MIL had been pestering her about baptizing our son nonstop and my wife finally caved. My wife has been working from home during covid while my job requires me to go into the office. My wife and MIL started doing zoom meetings with MIL's priest to start the baptism process.

He said he would take the proper steps to make sure MIL is no longer welcome in their church and to reach out to the local parish to see what further steps need to be taken. I have yet to hear back from them on that. My wife and MIL are mad that I got her kicked out of her church, but I don't care what they think or feel anymore.\n",

      "These people who I love and trust had betrayed me and I felt a range emotions I didn't know existed. My wife begged for forgiveness, but the fact that she didn't come clean on her own makes me feel she would have kept this from me unless I confronted her.

      "So I’m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we’re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have been added to a group chat labeled “*my brothers name* surprise dinner!” It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would “be nice to see me as well” so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn’t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I’s closest friends.\n",

      "This feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can’t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends.

      "\n",
      "In the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it’s just a celebration for “his” birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn’t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n",

      "I’ll just get straight to it. I’m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I’ve never been able to get a loan I’ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I’ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I’m there or when I’m not. Since I’ve been saving for this semester he’s the only one who’s been over I’ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it’s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn’t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn’t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I’m yelling at him about my money he’s acting all confused and like I’m crazy. He comes over I’m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he’ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it’s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They’ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it’s stressing me out even more and I hate that I’m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I’ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they’ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don’t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don’t know what to do and I hate that I’m contemplating doing this. I’m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.\n",

The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like \"I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago\" \"They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park\".

It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows.

It was 11pm and he decided to drive to his parents house and pick a fight with her about the text. According to my sister in law #1 who witnessed it he yelled at his mother and berated her and caller her names then disowned her which shocked everyone in the house.

I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.\n",

They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.\n",

I was invited to a wedding ceremony of a colleague and could bring someone with me. I asked my GF that I've been dating for a year if she would like to join me and she was really happy because she apparently loves weddings.

I'm not one for etiquette by far, but one of the few things I have heard everywhere is that you should not wear a white dress to a wedding unless you're the bride. She became pretty upset and wanted to know what was wrong with her dress. I said that it would be inappropriate to wear a white or off-white dress unless you're the bride - and that it's like wedding-law or something, trying to be lighthearted about it. She rolled her eyes and said that it was an outdated tradition about women and virginity and that when her friends got married everyone wore white and that it's not a big thing anymore.\n",

      "I told her that I don't know what the dress code is for this ceremony, but since it's not saying \"all white clothes\" I still thought she should change to another color but white or \"almost-white\" - because my colleague was getting married and we had no idea how she felt about it. My gf became really upset and told me that I was trying to control what she was wearing and that it was abusive, which honestly made me really upset and hurt. I said something along the lines of \"Fuck, well you shouldn't go to a wedding with an abuser then\" and then I told her to fuck off out of my car. She began to cry and wanted to apologize and give me a hug, but I just told her to get out, which she did (EDIT: To clarify we never left the driveway by her home, I did not drop her off in the middle of nowhere or anything like that).\n",

The bride was the only one that was wearing white so I feel as if my gut feeling was the right one. When I got home my phone had blown up by texts from her and her best friend saying that I was being inconsiderate and controlling and should apologize for my behavior. I've vented to a few friends - most of them agreeing with me but some have said that it was an asshole thing to tell her that she could not wear her dress - because it had nothing to do with me. I feel as if I was in the right since it was my colleagues wedding and it was better to be safe than sorry, but I'm also not sure if I was being an asshole about the situation. So, reddit AITA?\n",

She asked if she could come over, and I said no and that it would be best for us to go our separate ways. She got upset and asked why I wouldn't even try to work it out. I basically just said good bye and then she said my dick was small which actually made me laugh after what had been a pretty mature conversation and then she hung up. I'm pretty sad about it, she really made me feel happy but as many of you have commented - if this was our first disagreement and she called me abusive how would future disagreements look? I was hurt, but if she did think I was being abusive, it would be the right thing to do, and if she did not think I was being abusive and said it anyways I would not want to be with her.

I have a few problems with this I feel like they should find a new place together because I’ve lived here longer.

At that time she agreed and said that her and her boyfriend would look for a place together. I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fiancé and their friends harassing me about it.

She said she was dancing and looked at Mary’s pregnant belly and couldn’t take it anymore, started crying and ran out. All of Mary’s friends followed her out to console her. I consoled her myself, and said “ok let’s go babe. Where do you want to go? We can go for a drive so you can feel better”, she looked at me weird and asked why she would leave. I asked why she would stay. She said she feels better now and can go have a good time. I sighed and said “babe, you know that’s not going to happen. And I doubt the attention will be on Mary after this and that’s not great. It’s her baby shower and she deserves to be celebrated. I can’t see how people are going to shift their focus from consoling you to celebrating her if you’re still there”.

If they consoled you for a few minutes that’s fine but the entire party? We really should’ve left earlier”. She looked at me so offended and said “are you Mary’s husband or mine?”.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l4ndlk/update_aita_for_trying_to_send_my_deaf_daughter/ Thank you all for your advice on my last post. I wasn't aware of all the laws about this kinda thing. For those of you who didn't read the OP basically my 6YO daughter is deaf and communicates using ASL. There is a public school near us but it's very bad and the whole district has a rating of 1.5/5 stars. All of our other children go to a private school near us. But the private school said they wouldn't pay for an interpreter because there is a deaf school in our county, but the deaf school only teaches speech and no sign language so we decided not to send her there. We also wanted her to go to the private school because there was a language option for ASL so she may be able to communicate with other classmates. But my brother said that we shouldn't push trying to get her in, if the school doesn't want her we should just give up.\n",

      "\n",
      "He emailed back and forth with the school. We're not sure what was said exactly but by the end of it, not only did the school agree to pay for the interpreter but they also provided a free scholarship and let us request which teacher she had which they didn't let us do for any of our other kids. There is a kindergarten teacher who knows some ASL so we chose to be in her class. I'm not sure exactly why they did this but I think it's probably because denying entry to a kindergartener just because she's deaf would not look so good if other people found out. But I'm not complaining.\n",

      "She started 2 weeks ago and she loves it(They are doing hybrid) she is able to make friends and talk to other kids(Though in kinda broken sign language). Her interpreter is very nice and will update us on how she did everyday unlike the interpreter she had when she was in public school. Her teacher also tried to sign when she's speaking as much as possible and so do some of the kids. Overall I'm so happy this happened and I wouldn't have known there was anything I could do about it until I asked on here, so thank all of you who replied to the OP and told me they do have to provide an interpreter for her.\n",

Mom sat me down and apologized first before telling me that they had Garreth's DNA tested to make sure that he's mine. I was speechless for a moment and before I blew up from anger I told dad to give me my son and they better leave before I lose whatever respect I had left for them. My mom was very apologetic and said it's because they don't trust my wife and that our son looks nothing like me. I didn't argue anymore and told them to get out of my house. My wife was in the kitchen preparing for lunch and told her my parents had an emergency that's why they left without saying a word. I didn't tell my wife about the whole DNA test thing until after two weeks when she asked why mom and dad didn't visit anymore. I told her everything as I know I cannot keep a secret from her.

I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her.

She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong.

We’ve had a few rough patches, but what’s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we’re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.\n",

I’ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent.

He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said \"To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance.\" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.\n",

      "My SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?\n",

      "Edited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. \n",

Last week I encountered a middle aged woman, around 50 years old as I was coming off a trail. She was walking in my direction as I came out of the bush. It was strange to see her, the sun was almost down and the weather was starting to turn. also, this was an intermediate collection of trails at best, difficult even for me at worst. and she didn't look super athletic. Point is, my 'weird' radar was going off already.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked up to me and stopped, standing too close for my comfort, gestured toward the clearing where my car was parked, and asked whether it was my car. No greeting or anything. When I looked over something made me uncomfortable- there were no cars other than mine in sight. The trail I was on isn't crazy far from civilization but it's not a walk away- one of those highway rest stops that's there for the trail and a few parking spots. no way she could have got there without driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "I let her know that, yes, it was my car, to which she responded something like \"Perfect, there's a storm coming, I can't be caught in it and I need to get home\". She was very matter of fact. It seemed like she had already decided what would happen. without waiting for my response, she started striding for my car. I am glad I always lock my doors because she would have hopped right in the passenger seat had the door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she was walking over to it, I went after her trying to explain that I wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to hitch a ride- asking why she was out here in the first place. I was talking to a brick wall until she realised the car was locked, at which point she turned around with this look of anger and frustration on her face. She starts ranting- the same stuff as before \"I NEED to get home\" \"A STORM is coming\" \"I CANNOT be caught in it\" \"Why don't you get it?!\". I was very confused at this point, and a little scared, as this woman was now a barrier between me and my vehicle. I told her something like 'I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable with having a stranger in my car'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared me down for a few seconds, I guess trying to gauge her chances at asking again. And just like that, the anger drops from her face and she’s silent. I was really uncomfortable. I asked if I could call someone, if there was another way to help. she starts walking- towards me (scary), but then right past me. I'm still asking her questions, then just saying things like \"hello\" and \"excuse me\". no response. She walked to the other end of the rest stop and maintained eye contact with me as she sat down on a log, then just stared at nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t follow her. I got into my car really shaken up and drove away. As soon as I was back in cell range I called fire and rescue, they said they would send someone out. I was scared for my safety in the moment, but she was just some woman alone in the middle of nowhere. Am I the asshole for refusing this strange woman a ride/shelter in my car?\n",

I agreed with him but I thought that since the shoes were for him then it'd be different, he said I screwed up and shouldn't have bought those sneakers without even telling him. but in my defense I said that the price was low so it's not like I spent $100 on shoes, and also I saw this as a great deal and wanted him to have those nice sneakers. He plainly said that what I did is considered \"stealing\" since he never consented to have those sneakers purchased and said that I'm being irresponsible with money that is why I no longer have an income and my spending habits need a \"grib\". I felt hurt by what he said. We argued about it for hours and he avoided speaking to me the rest of the day.\n",

      "This past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.\n",

It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. \n",

The HR lady said that I have every right to continue to test my blood sugar in my office. When I told her that James suggested I test only at specific times of the day, her eyes got really big and she was like, “NO. Do not test your blood sugar on a schedule suggested to you by your coworker. Only your doctor.”\n",

      "This system worked great...for a week. One day he called as usual, I said sure come over, but then he...didn’t come over. After about ten minutes I actually needed to check my blood sugar but thought with my luck he’d walk in at the exact moment I was testing. I ended up calling him back and he said that he got distracted and forgot he had a question for me. A few days later it happened again, and I was a bit annoyed that twice I delayed testing because I thought he was going to be entering my office at any second. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after I found out that James had put in his two-week notice. He explained that me being diabetic wasn’t the only reason why he was quitting, he wanted different hours etc, but that it did play a role. Later, Megan (our other coworker) told me that James told her that he really struggled with me being diabetic. For example, even just thinking, “I need to ask a question, but I have to call first to make sure he’s not checking his blood sugar” was distressing to him because then he’d be thinking about it, which would make him feel queasy and anxious.\n",

He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?\n",

At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either.

      "\n",
      "It came down to a comment I made in front of Nicole's twin sister (Brittany). Amber had announced their engagement, and said that they were getting married in October, but no specific date. The three of us were chatting about things when Brittany brought up the announcement and mentioned how it seemed they were trying to steal the spotlight again, and I muttered about them even stealing the wedding day. Nicole had said she talked to Brittany about it, and she had, but didn't tell her they were doing it on the same day.\n",

There's a lot of...stuff...between those parts of the families. Brittany told them they had a week to figure out when in October they were getting married other than our wedding day, or she would tell everyone in the family what they were trying to do.\n",

A few days later they announced the date, but since Amber's fiance lost his job, and their families can't afford a traditional wedding, they're only inviting a small portion of their original guest list, and having a zoom wedding.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e0muyw/aita_for_banning_everyone_who_critiques_our/ My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn’t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn’t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn’t want to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn’t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying “I don’t want to,” but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn’t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I’ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we’re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can’t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife’s parents, her sister, and my mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?\n",

      "My (24F) mom died when I was 7 from leukemia. I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn’t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me. My grandmother put them all in a book for me after she died.  I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I’ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the “I’m your mom now” and my father didn’t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then. Unfortunately he got cancer when he was 3. And I pretty much ceased to exist for my father, he was either working or gone with my brother and I spent all my teen years mostly at home alone or with my grandparents. The mantra was that my brother needed to be the focus because he might die so I needed to not be selfish since I was healthy. I stopped trying to talk to him when I was 16 and it was a dark time.  I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom’s collages where she had written “Remember that your dad and I are always here for you” and I wrote “You failed. Go away.” underneath. I felt like him being able to see it from my literal perspective would communicate why I don’t want him back better than I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently it worked, but a little too well because I’ve been bombarded by family telling me that it’s understandable that I don’t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he’s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.\n",

      "Maybe it was, I know my bar for that is kind of weird sometimes, so AITA?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit - A couple of follow up notes, since it came up the comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  I loved my brother.  I don’t resent him.  He was a good kid and I wish he was still with us.  None of this is his fault, to me it is completely my father’s and to a lesser extent step-mother’s. The parents prevented me from spending time with him as he got sicker so I wouldn’t have been allowed to be there for him even if I had been able to (which I wasn’t towards the end because I was also struggling to stay alive).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  I have empathy.  I understand what my father lost, I was there.  I also lost those same people plus effectively my father.  Even so, to me there is no excuse for completely shutting your own kid completely out of your life while also preventing them from getting any kind of help.  I understand depression and freezing up, I’ve been there, and I still even not being an adult managed to consider the impact of my behavior on other people.  If he was that bad off, he should have given me up to be raised by someone else.  My mom’s parents asked and he wouldn’t agree to let me stay with them full time.  I could have had a dad that was able to occasionally tell me he loved me even if it was just a text message.  Alternatively, I could have lived with my grandparents and had people around me who cared about me every day even if that wasn’t my father.  I got neither and every request for help of any kind was met with “suck it up”.  I can empathize with having to function while breaking down inside, but I can’t empathize with what he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  I gather from relatives (who have backed off after some hard boundary setting) that my father and step-mother split not long ago and are in divorce proceedings, which is why he reached out now and why the rest of the family was upset with how I responded at the time - he wasn’t in a good place already.  I’ve told them that if they care about him to encourage him to keep away from me, refuse to pass on any messages, and try to get him into inpatient care or something if they’re that worried he’s going to do something rash.  I don’t want anything to do with him and I’ve told them that I don’t want to hear about anything that happens after this point, but the rest of his family love him so for their sake I hope he pulls himself together.\n",

She had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. My heart hurts for her. However, one thing I don’t agree with is how my family has handled it. We’re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can’t come to family events that she’ll attend. She won’t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. \n",

I didn’t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn’t have one period, “out of respect”. I said that was ridiculous. She didn’t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.\n",

I suggested booking a room near the hospital so we wouldn't miss it due to the drive but he wanted to see the game at a friend's place. He said he'd make it.\n",

      "While we were waiting to get me discharged he was getting agitated because it was taking a long time. He had to wait outside so he was in his car the whole time because of restrictions at the hospital. After a couple of hours he sent me a text that he had to leave or he'd miss the game. I begged him to not leave and reminded I could book a hotel. But he left without me, and luckily made it on time to see the start of the game. He said he'd come pick me up tomorrow (today) instead. \n",

He only sent me one whatsapp back that said he'd pick me up later but wanted to see the game. When I got home in the night he was so angry at me. He said I was the most selfish asshole for constantly ringing and texting him during the game and that I ruined the game for him and embarrassed him infront of his friends. He said he cannot even look at me and that I bring so much drama with me it's humiliating to him. I feel at complete loss. I think I might be the asshole for not understanding the cultural significance of football and asking my bf to do a completely unreasonable drive to pick me up. But on the other hand we could have watched the game in a hotel room and I wouldn't have been left alone in a hospital in another country. AITA?\n",

We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.\n",

      "I have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.\n",

When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.\n",

All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back.

Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. \n",

I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying \"I told you so I told you so\" then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too \"afraid\" to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late.

Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision.

I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope.

I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police.

They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me.

It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle.

      "\n",
      "The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. \n",

      "She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT).

But it’s not just a free handout.\n",

      "She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.\n",

I will follow her from a fake account, so her friends don't see her aunt on her friend lists. These restrictions will lessen in due time.

I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me.

I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too.

      "My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby.\n",

The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a \"done deal\". I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused.\n",

We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are \"cultural\" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he \"doesn't like\" vegan food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.\n",
      "\n",

I got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and I needed to eat within two hours so I began snacking. I immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said “can you not do that? Our son.” so I put my food away and figured I’d wait until the flight attendant came around so I could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, I start to ask for a Coke and a snack box, but before I can finish the sentence the father says “nothing for this row, we’re all set here” and she continues on. I go up to press the call light so I can get my food and my drink because I actually need it and the father says “our son has prader-willi, we’d prefer it if you didn’t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn’t know he can’t eat and he’s always hungry”. I’m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so I look him in the eye and say “I do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings”. \n",
      "\n",
      "The flight attendant comes back and I get my food and my drink, I snarf it down and chug my soda, and I sit back. As soon as I’m calmed and I’m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says “I feel a calling to educate you about my son’s disease” and I felt my entire body clench up. She keeps talking to me and explaining how I’d made her son feel and I said “listen lady, I don’t fucking care, I’m going to handle my T1D the way I see fit and you’re going to handle your son the way you see fit. I’m not endangering myself because you don’t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.”\n",

A perfect autumn soup!” My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, “Let the food keep us quiet.” I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. \n",

      "After a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn’t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn’t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.\n",

That my sister was not right because she never formally asked me and how was I supposed to just guess that she wanted it.

She was kind of jealous of my dress and of the wedding I almost had. And she was embarassed that she couldn't afford everything I could and that she felt like she failed as an adult and as a mother. And honestly I get it. Not because I think she is a failure, but because I get how it feels if your brain tells you you failed at life because you don't have things that other people have. She apologized also because she was trying to blame me for her problems and that everything was easier if she wasn't the one to blame. We talked a lot more time till I told her that she didn't need a fancy dress and that we could search something basic and I could help her to decorate it with something.

I have 2 sons, 9 and 6. He has 1 daughter \"Ann\", 17. I booked a road trip for me and my sons roughly 3 months ago. A road trip consisting of roughly 26 hours worth of driving with stops in between. This is the first time I've ever been financially able to do much of anything with my children so I went all out. Planned to stop at every place they had ever asked me to go, basically. I was beyond excited to surprise them with this trip. We got home 4 nights ago.\n",

From the moment Ann got in to my vehicle she started complaining about absolutely everything. It was too crowded, too loud, we were taking too many stops, the boys were \"too annoying\" and \"need to quiet the fuck down and chill out\". \n",

So I snapped, told him to pull the fuck over. When he finally does, I drive to the nearest car rental and tell them to get the fuck out of my car. Dave and Ann both start flipping out. Ann saying she isnt going to get in a car that has \"bed bugs\". Dave saying he didnt want to take separate vehicles and didnt have enough money for a rental because the queen spent over $1500 in 4 days. So I say \"I dont believe I fucking asked.\" And take off.

      "My aunt (40) has been staying with my family-that’s me, my mom, my dad and my 13 year old sister- during quarantine. She is REALLY not someone I like. She critiques every little thing my sister and I do, tells us we need to eat more (or less, depending on the day, even though we’re skinny), butts in to our personal conversation and just is snoopy in general. She tries to instigate fights between us- like asking my sister if she’s mad I have something she doesn’t. It’s also important to know she’s done nothing to learn about communicating with me. I’d say about 90% of the rest of my extended family knows sign language. We’ve told our parents about it a million times, and they’ve talked to her. I don’t think they’ve given her an ultimatum, so my sister and I devised a plan. \n",

      "For the past few days whenever my aunt starts talking, I just detach my hearing aids and my sister puts in her airpods and turns up the volume. We can understand each other fine. My aunt didn’t get it the first couple of times but I think today she understood we were ignoring her and got really upset. She told my dad, and from what I understand, he basically told her she needs to lay off if she’s bothering us that bad or she can leave. I was happy to hear that, tbhz \n",

      "I heard (lol) her crying later though, and that made me feel like *shit*. I never meant to make someone cry and now I kinda regret the whole thing. Are my sister and I assholes for going to such extreme measures? We just wanted her to leave us alone, or at least be nice to us.\n",

      "I have good hearing with the implants in. Without them in,  I will only hear some thing VERY loud right next to my ear (like if someone claps into it). Doctors typically rate it on a scale- I am severely deaf. Cochlear implants have two parts- external and internal. The external connects to the internal with a magnet. It comes off like you would take off a magnet on your fridge. I CAN switch it off, but I thought the message would get across better if I yanked it off my head. \n",

      "I wish I could answer everyone who’s PM’d me or left comments about the implants. I think unfortunately that’s something for your doctor- everyone is different. \n",

      "I agree aunt doesn’t need to learn sign language. However- because I was in early intervention and then speech therapy for most of my childhood, I have a more “normal” speaking voice and so she says I should talk. It’s a bit nasally sounding to me and I prefer to sign. Aunt likes to move out of my line of sight and that forces me to speak and makes me feel bad. \n",

They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff.

I went back to college and got my degree and began looking for work. I found a job I liked in my field, and six months into working, he said he was offered a job with a new company and wanted to take it, but that would mean we would be moving almost 2,000 miles from where we were in a new state.

As for the package, our mutual friend found the box it was supposed to be shipped in by the trash in front of her house so I guess she’s not shipping it anymore. I don’t know what was in it, but all evidence and other context which is too long to post points to it being a “substance”. At This point, I’m hoping that it was just weed and not something more dangerous. Once again, thank you everyone! \n",

So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room.

He still can't turn on the oven or use the stove without help. The toaster is too complicated for him to use he claims.  Doesn't know how to boil eggs, cook rice, or even how to measure out ingredients using cups. I just don't understand why he can't grasp this but is fine with other things. \n",

I said screw it and bought the easiest ingredients I could find for a lot cheaper for him to cook on his own. He doesn't like leftovers, so me cooking ahead for him was out. Before I left, I sat him down once again and gave him a very long lesson on using the oven, toaster, and stove, as well as how to boil/scramble eggs, toast a piece of toast, boil rice/noodles, and heat up pasta sauce. I also taught him how to pan fry things like onions and other veggies, and how to tell when they were ready.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jfdbk3/aita_for_refusing_to_name_our_daughter_karen/ My wife and I recently found out we’re having a daughter. We hadn’t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom’s name was Karen and my mom’s name wasn’t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom’s name as her first name and her mom’s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can’t okay “Karen” as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don’t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I’d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn’t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she’s pretty insistent on Karen.\n",

      "Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. I thought I’d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I’d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she’s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn’t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I’d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won’t be a meme by the time she’s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I’ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still). It seemed completely perfect to both of us so we’re going with it. Thanks for all your inputs!\n",

Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well.

To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was.

I told my son that he had his whole life ahead of him and he could get married later, but didn't need to rush it. I told him that if he went to college and waited, even just a year or two, I'd pay for his tuition. At the time I didn't know how serious their relationship was as they'd been together for a little over a year, and was scared it wouldn't work out and he'd waste this opportunity.

It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real.

But he just insisted people at gyms look out for each other, and that going forward, I should probably wear a bra so other people wouldn't get uncomfortable and that it may help me stay more balanced in my squats. I'm literally the only girl at the weights section of the gym at the moment, and other guys who were squatting and failed sets never have to worry about this shit. I've seen guys fail multiple sets in a row and no one ever rushes to their aid, but I have a very slight pause, and everyone thinks I need rescuing. So I'm now really annoyed and also kind of uncomfortable that this guy I've never spoken to in my life thinks he's helping me and then has the audacity to tell me how to dress.\n",

Honestly I'm not sure if I overreacted, but I'm still kind of pissed off so maybe that's clouding my judgment. AITA?\n",

Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over?

I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this.

I didn't argue with him about it since I already know what it's like having a parent who doesn't want you around or wants to be in your life.

She is over the moon about them.\" He just said \" She loves me more than the kids so I doubt this will be an issue for her.\" After a bit more talking we finally hung up.

      "Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: \"So did we get a turkey?\"\n",

I was fuming I went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but I was able to get the wig back. I lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. They said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. My sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. I told her her daughters were recording her! She saw nothing wrong in it and said I overreacted as well. I lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave.

I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits.

She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. \n",

      "I explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault.

      "So, am I the asshole here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. \n",

She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was \"unfair\" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got \"nothing,\" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. \n",

I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. \n",

While he ended up going into IT, I stayed in the liberal arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when I realized I didn’t actually want to be a schoolteacher. Just to say that we always assumed he’d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more I always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. To make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more niche areas. I recently started a new job as a consultant, making way more than I’d ever anticipated. When I got the offer, I told Tim that the pay was “amazing”, but he didn’t ask about the actual amount and I didn’t want to be braggy about it, especially since I was fairly sure it was above his current income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well we just put in an application for a new place, and in the process of having to submit our paystubs it’s become obvious that I make roughly 30% more than he does now. I expected him to think that was cool, since he’s a feminist and has always been super supportive of my career. But instead he’s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how I “cheated the system” to get where I am, that no English lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "His major point is that I got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to “trample” more qualified people who didn’t have the same advantages. It’s true that I got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody’s daddy’s firm. He also points out that at my first corporate job, I snagged a big promotion after volunteering to take on starting up the company’s diversity/equity/inclusion program, and I’ll admit that were I a white *man*, it’s highly unlikely I would have been able to be the face of the eventually high-profile diversity program. Tim also notes that I was awarded a small college scholarship for being a “promising female writer”, when no such scholarship existed for males.\n",
      "\n",

I reached a breaking point yesterday when he made a crack about how the new/first woman on his team is an obvious diversity hire. I told him that his jokes about women cheating the system to get ahead aren’t funny or “guy-talk ribbing” as he says, they make him sound like an insecure little boy.

      "I have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. \n",

      "3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. \n",

I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. \n",

      "Soon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. \n",

      "2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said \"Ok\". She then asked \"Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?\"\n",

He made a comment about \"The light will only be on for 5 freaking minutes.\" Which is not true. He turns the light on, finds himself clothes and then goes to take a shower without turning the light off. If I turn the light off, he will come back into the room after the shower and turn it on again to grab his socks and put on his shoes.

Well, this morning he flips on the fucking light again so I sit up and I'm like \"Are you kidding me right now?\" And he says \"I'm being quiet!\" As if that was the only issue.

Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.\n",

My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’\n",

      "She's a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.\n",

Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, \"I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again.\" We ended up going out instead.\n",

      "It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though.

We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, \"fake\" replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do.

Her father and my husband died in an accident when she was young, so it’s been just us two for a long time. As a result we are very close and she’s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they’ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first ‘boyfriend’. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it’s just the mum inside me but I couldn’t be happier for her. \n",

They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won’t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don’t want to live with her. \n",

She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said ‘I would never allow my kids to do that,’ so I replied by saying ‘That’s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.’ She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I’m wondering if I crossed the line.\n",

I asked her if she really had no idea and she said that, looking back, there were warning signs but nothing that would lead her to believe that he was overtly racist. I guess being long distance and liking him so much allowed her to remain mostly ignorant. She wanted to know what she should do. I told her that I was going to talk to Dan and try to get a beat on who HE is apart from his parents. She seemed to think that was a good idea.\n",

A lot of you were trying to figure out what Amy meant by him not being \"wholly\" racist and I think I can answer that now. He told me that he doesn't harbor any hatred for anyone, but he believes the white race will go extinct eventually and he is proud of who he is and of his race and he doesn't want that to happen. Which I guess also explains his fathers comment about white grandbabies. I told him that his heritage is nothing to be proud of and that his beliefs will have no place in our family or in my household. He said that Amy seemed to understand him and that I might not have a choice of whether or not his beliefs will be a part of my family. I said that he was right, if Amy wants to move forward with the wedding then there is nothing I can do to stop her. He sneered and told me that he supposed we had nothing more to discuss and that was the end of it.\n",

I said her hair color grew out of people’s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter’s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it’s pretty racist to say she can’t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks “natural”. \n",

She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year.

When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold.

She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn’t want to be rude to his family but it’s getting super weird. I don’t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I’m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said “a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche” which roughly translates to “to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth” when she meant “this pumpkin pie tastes delicious”) \n",

      "I (30m) purchased a 3 bedroom condo in Toronto, Canada 5 years ago when I was in my second year of medical residency. Soon after the purchase, I rented one of the rooms to my roommate (f29) to offset the costs of the mortgage. I live in one room, she lives in the second, and the third is my study/office. She has been a great roommate from the beginning. We aren’t necessarily friends (as in we don’t do things together for fun), but we get along exceptionally well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire roommate/tenant relationship has gone swimmingly up until recently. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate broke the news to me that she is pregnant. The father was a fling of hers, who does not want anything to do with the child. My roommate has decided she wants to keep the child anyways, and raise it on her own. To me that seems like a huge challenge, and I admire her for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is, while I don’t necessarily dislike children, I have no desire to live with a baby. While the condo is a fair size, I will most definitely be woken up by the babies crying at night. My condo is also where I like to come home to and relax, like a haven after a long work day, and the idea of coming home to a baby honestly seems absolutely chaotic. Especially since this isn’t my own child (ie one that my girlfriend and I decided to have/was mentally prepared for).\n",
      "\n",
      "As difficult as it was for me to do this, I told my her essentially what I’ve written here, and that it would be best if she finds somewhere else to live. I am not rushing her out or anything like that, I have given her 6 month’s notice, since any later than that will come too close to the birth. She was honestly quite taken aback by this, and thought that I was being cruel. Her primary concern is that rent has gone up substantially in this city since she signed on with me (I haven’t increased her rent since she moved in, so she’s essentially paying 2015 rent). She works as a waitress, and will likely need to find a lesser apartment to keep within the same budget. A couple of other considerations are that she was out of work while restaurants were closed, but I did waive her rent for that period. All of the furniture is also mine (aside from her bedroom), so she would need to figure something out on that front as well, aside from all of the child expenses. I understand her position, and I feel horrible about the situation, but I honestly can’t do it. AITA for this?\n",

      "Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. There have been two great suggestions on how I can make this situation better, which I have taken to heart. I haven't been able to give life much thought lately, as work has been quite busy. Firstly, I have a friend in real estate, and I'm going to see if they can help her try to find some affordable listings. Secondly - as I don't plan to take on another tenant after her, and can afford to do this anyway - I have decided I'm going to waive her rent for the remainder of the tenancy. This will hopefully give her a bit of a boost to get on her feet.\n",

I was planning to reply to as many posts as possible, but honestly seeing as there are over 2000 comments, I think I will have to just address some common questions here.

Or do you suggest that I let her raise the child here until they are 18?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finally, the update:** When I came home from work today, I told her that I wanted to discuss the overall situation. Before I even began, she actually apologized to me for how she spoke to me, and for expecting that I would be okay for her to raise her child here. I told her that her apology is totally unnecessary, as her reaction was completely understandable considering the uncertainty of her future. I then told her that what I told all of you; that I would waive her rent for the remainder of her stay to help her get on her feet. She pushed back on this at first, but after I urged her to think of her child, she graciously accepted. Aside from this, I also told her about my friend who could help her out with finding some affordable listings in the area. I thought I might be overstepping there, but she was actually extremely thankful and said she would take me up on there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I want to thank u/tuttipeachyfrutti for probably the best piece of advice that I've read (I'm sure there are many more people that I should be thanking, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to read everything here). This was that I could help her obtain a more reliable work position at my hospital, nothing fancy as she doesn't have any schooling, but it will be much more secure than waitressing (and once you're in, there's always ways to work your way up). There would also be benefits/maternity leave that I don't think restaurants usually offer. This was probably my biggest risk of overstepping, but when I mentioned the idea to her she was actually over the moon (tears were shed...). I do agree that I acted in self interest here, so I think it's the least I can do to make sure this soon to be mother and her child have some sense of security in their lives. Thank you again to everyone.\n",

We have always split things 50/50 in the 2 years we have been together. There were a few times on the vacation when she did not go on outings with us- wine tasting/scuba diving/etc. She also would only eat 2 meals a day, simply stating that she was on a budget. My family does favor more high-end (\\*expensive\\*) places. My parents thought it was very strange that she only eats 2 meals a day although normally she eats 3. \n",

She got teary eyed and said that 3 meals a day wasn't fiscally feasible for her and neither were the outings that she chose not to go on (she went on 3 of 6 outings). She said she was not expecting everything to cost so much and she was overwhelmed. \n",

Her first text arrived a little before I got to her place, but I didn't see it until I got to work because my phone is always on silent when I drive. I rang her, said I'll arrange to work from home, then come get the kids. She said I have 45 mins to get back to her place or she would call the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my supervisor the situation, and she said I could leave after I did a few things. This delayed me 20 mins. When I got back to my sister in law's, just over an hour later, she said she'd already called the police when the 45 mins ran out. I then had to stick around long enough to tell the officer that I didn't abandon my children, there was just a communication issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sister in law and I had another shouting match later over this. I arranged other childcare for my kids and I've been mostly ignoring her since. However, she reached out and apologised, and has asked if I'd be willing to go back to the old childcare arrangement. I've told her to go fuck herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work with kids. If I got child abandonment on my record, I would never work in my field again, which she knew, and her calling the police was a *massive* overreaction, so if she needs a babysitter she can go whistle for all I care. She said that if I checked my phone, talked to her that morning, or came back when I was supposed to, she would not have needed to call the police, and I did this to myself, as she gave me a warning with that first text and I could have checked my phone or spoken to her directly when I got to her place, all of which she says she would have done if she were in my position, given that we'd argued the night before. I've told her that if she thinks I'm babysitting for her, she's fucking delusional, and she's on her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of my refusal, it's looking like she may have to quit her job because my brother and her would pay more for a babysitter than they would earn from her working. My mother and brother have both called me an arsehole because there were no consequences to her calling the police, and that while she overreacted, she's apologised, so if I really forgive her, I'll let us move on. This income loss would also mean that she, my brother, and my niece and nephew might need to move somewhere cheaper, that my brother might have to take on extra hours at work, and in an extreme scenario they may even be completely unable to live independently, meaning they'd have to move in with her parents, who live several hours away.\n",

I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working.

I moved slow in the relationship, although I had fallen in love with her fast. When things got serious, I overheard her telling her sister she was concerned that I might be an ‘aggressive type’ person because of the amount of scars I have.

At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together.

      "2) for ever man calling me a slut: you’re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so “closing my legs” or “quit being easy” doesn’t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single “whore” had one thing in common and that’s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! \n",

      "3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody’s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. \n",

      "\n",
      "First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. \n",
      "\n",
      "I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she’s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. \n",
      "\n",
      "I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn’t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she’d “call the doctor (her supervisor)” right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn’t be back in the office until next Monday. \n",

After we made our announcement Tiffany messaged me asking why I would spend thousands on creating a child when I could helped one who already existed. I tried to play it off but Tiffany kept pressing and calling me a bad person when there are so many children who desperately need a home and overpopulation. It got to the point where she was pissing me off and I just came clean and said that her behavior towards the people who loved and raised her was the reason. Tiffany got really upset but I didn't care, however, her parents are now starting to say that I was wrong so AITA?\n",
      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lag3tq/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_house_after/ My M36 wife passed away 2 years ago. I have a 11 year old son named Sean. I'm doing okay with money. I have a stable income and support system. I have a friend named Kate we've been together since we were kids. She's like a sister to me although she tends to boss me around. She's introduced me to her female friends hoping that I'll settle down again. I told her I have other priorities and I'm required to focus on Sean and his health (he's diabetes). Kate thinks there's something wrong with me but Not everyone's circumstances the same. I started noticing a pattern in her behavior after she introduced me to a friend of hers. She'd tell me to leave Sean at home when we hang out and meet her friends. She'd tell me to take down any pictures that have my son and wife in it because ladies will \"assume\" that I'm a single dad or still married and that'd limit my chances in dating. I told her to knock it off. And she said that she was looking out for my \"social\" life saying I'm ruining it and exhausting myself. I stopped talking to her for days. Then I decided to let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's been insisting on bringing her friend to visit me with other friends. I agreed to have them as guests. Kate suggested I take Sean to stay with a relative since it'll be adult dinner but I refused. He was comfortable in his home and didn't wanna go. Kate was at my place before her friends arrived. I checked on Sean and told him to tell me if he needed anything before he went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 12:30 while I was sitting and just starting to chat with Kate's friend while Kate kept blinking at me with a smirk on her face. I got a text message from Sean telling me he wanted to use the bathroom but the door handle was stuck and he couldn't open the door. I went upstairs to check. Kate followed me. I found that the door was actually locked. I was confused I asked Sean and he said he didn't lock it. I started looking for the key that's when Kate quietly handed it to me saying she took it. I was stunned. I opened the door for Sean then I asked her why she locked the door she said that lied to her friend about me not having kids and didn't want her to see Sean. She said it was no big deal since he was sleeping but I was furious. I started yelling at her as she kept shushing me. Everyone started leaving after I yelled at Kate and cussed her out for doing this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She blew up after her friend left and said I was an idiot cause most people don't mention kids until after months into dating. And that I didn't deserve her help to move on when she thought I was a decent \"sane\" person. I called her stupid and told her to get out of my house. She told me to wallow in my misery and left. Then her friends kept blaming me for making a scene and treating Kate like that especially since she cooked dinner and helped a lot.\n",

We'll just keep one happy pup's picture up, while she's safe in a loving foster home, and hope that you'll share her pics and check out her rescue site until somone takes this lovable little fuzzface home.

Hazel has NO history of aggression against people or cats.  --Anyone saying she was abandoned because of either of these things is making up stories.--*  \n",

It's my feeling that a healthy and friendly 65lb dog who occasionally runs around with excitement can knock little kids down and bump them by accident. (Ever have a dog headbutt you because you were leaning over them when they decided to jump up? That kind of thing.) The rescue will explain her energy level in detail to any family with small children who applies and let them decide if they think their child is old/large/mature enough to handle this. In some cases, the rescue will make that evaluation and not approve the application. This is a very thoughtful, careful process that is carried out in private between the individual who applies and the co-ordinator who knows the dog much better than I (or anyone in a comment stream making gross assumptions) does.*\n",

In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago). \n",

      "Background. I (30f) lived with a longtime friend (30m). We lived together for 6 years and known each other for 20 years (close families)  He was very accepting that I came with a cat, I paid for everything and legally owned her. He adored her though and would spend hours cuddling her.  I owned everything, all the furniture and the white goods because I had lived out of home before but he had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got a GF at the 3.5 year mark and she practically moved in immediately. I still paid half the rent though. She was always very rude to me and clearly didn't want me alone with my friend.  There was only one lounge, attached to the kitchen, so he and I would previously watch TV together or just be in the same room while another cooked, worked etc. When she moved in that 'had to stop' because I was interfering with their couple time. Her attitude towards me got worse over time and my friend started treating me badly. They would leave sex toys all over the place, watch movies late and loud when my  bedroom was right there, glare at me if I cooked during their couple time even though they hogged the TV between 4-9pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a bf and started spending a lot of time with him.  After this things got worse.  My friend began locking my cat in small cages and putting her the shower. He also began talking differently to me and leave the kitchen in a absolute mess (mould) to make it difficult for me to cook. I found used condoms in the lounge.  It then got to the stage where we wouldn't talk but all the tormenting was still going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to leave and started looking for somewhere else.  The lease was up in 4 months but we had not discussed what we wanted to do. I found out through his sister (and a close friend of mine) that they had been saving up this whole time to move out and would be moving in a few weeks'. This was news to me. I couldn't afford the rent by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a place before they did, spoke to the estate agent and advised them of the situation - turns out he had not been paying his full share of the rent and she was not listed as living there. The agent did not hold me accountable for any of it.  I paid 4 weeks' leave before I left. I didn't tell them when I was leaving and on a day when they were not home my friends helped me pack up and leave.  The house was cleaned spotless.  I also took all of my furniture, whitegoods and kitchenware - so basically everything but his room! I took my cat.\n",

HR started the process, apparently immediately, because I walked in yesterday to a shitstorm. \n",
      "\n",
      "This plunged the department into civil war. Many agree Peg was out of line, some told me I should’ve kept the status quo, some said I was ungrateful and entitled. One said I should have handled this “maturely” and “who could blame her” when I look “like that”, and I should be ashamed of myself. Another coworker suggested I work from home. Another told me he was sorry for not stepping in. I went to go get my lunch out of the fridge only to find someone had disposed of it and left behind the empty Tupperware. Nearly everyone has an opinion. The people in my corner have advised me to keep my head down and to take care. \n",

I brought up Peg’s comments and my boss said I invited them, no one would call that harassment, and I need to work on myself. Together we went through each of the 23 events. She excused each of them until I was left to feel like I‘d been harassing Peg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next meeting was even worse. Effectively Boss said, “I told you not to retaliate and instead you searched Peg out to harass her” and “your actions have expressed a worrying lack of cooperation with me and your team.” She was also disappointed that instead of explaining that I needed her to resolve things, I “escalated the situation well beyond the point of reason” and cruel to someone who only wanted to help. She said I won’t get far in life and I’m not likely to get anywhere vocationally if I can’t be a team player and “actively sabotage a happy workplace”. She hoped I will learn from this “teachable moment” how to behave in a collaborative environment as it’s inappropriate to involve HR for “small misunderstandings”. \n",

I told him he never even gave me a chance to show him how good my cooking is and that he's probably just used to his mom's cooking and is rejecting any other alternatives which's unfair to me. He said that I shouldn't have lied to him and basically tricked him into eating food that he had no idea where it came from. I said he liked it and admitted that it was good so what's the issue.

I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.

I lost it on him and immediately demanded his friend to send the money back and threatened police involvement in case he refused. His friend immediately returned the money but told my husband about the polic thing and my husband came home and yelled at me calling me unhinged and selfish. I told him I saved up some of this money/used my inheritance for this treatment while he contributed nothing even though we're in this together. He \"corrected\" me saying I'm the one with the problem and he thought it's only fair that I \"make up\" for it by paying for the IVF myself. This hurt so badly and I couldn't argue anymore.

This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.

Basically the mean type and have picked on their behavior. I've sat with my daughter and had many discussions about how her behavior has been negatively affecting everyone around her. Our housemaid is the person most affected here and my daughter has chosen her to be her target for hair, clothes, \"etiquette\" criticism. She has complained about our daughter calling her offensive names like filthy and gross for cleaning certain areas in our house.

I checked the indoor camera before continuing the argument and saw my daughter place her iphone inside our housemaid's bag, I was livid. I apologized to the housemaid and gave her the rest of the day off. I then showed the video to my daughter and she was absolutely speechless. I said what she did was immoral and straight up offensive to tamper with that poor woman's livelihood over a petty party she couldn't go to.

She developed what we believe was post partum depression, but was never diagnosed as she refused therapy. When Annie's school started up again our mother took on all childcare of Sophie. As mum took on more childcare, Annie seemed more like her old self (happy, outgoing, generally mentally healthy). Then within 6 months of Sophie's birth, Annie got pregnant again with another girl, Laura, and the cycle of PPD symptoms, mum taking over, and Annie's mood improving repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Laura was 2 and Sophie was 3, Annie decided to move out of our parent's home, *alone*, and said she wanted our parents to adopt/raise her daughters. They said no. Annie said she couldn't take care of the girls as she had her own life and being a parent made her miserable. My husband and I already had 4 kids of our own, we'd bonded with the girls, and we had the resources for 2 more, so we offered to take them in, and Annie let us legally adopt them before moving about 8 hours away.\n",

      "Annie has now asked for \"custody\" of Sophie and Laura. I'm writing \"custody\" like that because it wouldn't be custody in the legal sense, as she willingly surrendered all legal rights to the girls and can't get them back (we checked with a lawyer). However, Annie wants the girls to live with her. Initially she said she wanted them full time and to legally adopt them back from us, which we obviously refused, then she offered a \"compromise\" of alternate weeks, so 50/50 \"custody\". Again, we refused. Given her insistence, we don't even want her around Sophie and Laura, so we've not been going by my parent's house as we typically do.\n",

I've responded that we are not babysitters, we are Sophie and Laura's parents, they're in a good place and this will be detrimental to all 6 kids, and Annie doesn't get to step in now when she never stepped up in the first place. The response from my parents and Annie is that I'm being unsympathetic to her PPD and I should let her at least have a chance, rather than deem her unfit without giving her a chance to prove herself, plus given that we already have 4 kids other than them, Sophie and Laura could probably do with a smaller household, and saying we're being unreasonable for not allowing Annie to bond with \"her\" kids.\n",

This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal).

      "I work from home and my job is relaxed and doesn't require me to be glued to the screen, my girlfriend works in a stressful customer service job and most of her days are terrible. In the 2 years we've been living together, I do practically all the chores around the house and I try to treat her to like a queen when she comes back home. However, the one thing I can't do is be a handyman no matter how easy the task is. A few months ago, the bathroom door hinges needed replacing so I called a friend to help.\n",

      "They ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth: \n",

      "  “I’m the one your son puts his penis in.” \n",

      "Maybe I let my expectations get too high, and it’s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend’s parents - whom she’d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped. \n",

      "I felt like he’d sold me the full package, everything he’d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn’t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who’s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn’t let up. \n",

      "\n",
      "The comment about her looking like her picture shows my age, sorry for that! He’s only shown us her photos she’s sent him as he apparently didn’t have any of them together (he hates taking pictures and apparently she’s always teasing him about it). I don’t think he’d ever lie about who she is, but it’s just a parental concern I’ve subconsciously had. I felt the same way about my daughter’s (then) boyfriend when we first met him. I don’t have any criteria that either of my kids’ spouses need to meet, I just hope my kids are happy with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I meant by her being ‘the full package’ was indicative of what he’s told us about her. As his parents we have a good idea of what he looks for in a partner and she checked off everything based on what we’d been told. And on top of everything (aside from what she said) her appearance was how she presented it to be. Again, we aren’t strict about appearances, it’s just a relief to have met someone for the first time and they look like what you’d expected. My husband said that I was worried about ‘second-hand catfishing’ if that’s even a thing lol. I guess it shows how anxious I was about this.\n",

      "\n",
      "UPDATE: Thanks for reaching out everyone. My son got in touch with me. His girlfriend agreed to try again. We all met at a restaurant my son and his girlfriend chose. The first thing she said was an apology for what she said. I apologized for my reaction. We hugged. It was nice. She then explained how my son had convinced her a joke like that would land well, and that she wouldn’t have said it if she didn’t think we’d like it. According to my son, she was reluctant to open with any jokes at all, but they came up with that one together on the way over. You guys were right! \n",
      "\n",
      "She’s a really sweet girl. She’s actually very mature, too. I see why my son likes her so much. My husband and I really like her, we told our son to bring her when he visits. We look forward to seeing them again. Overall, I’m glad we could start over. On the right foot this time. Thanks, everyone for your input.\n",

Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said \"I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!\". She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying \"Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing\" but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful .\n",

My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a \"selfish b!tch\" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written \"mother and daughter.\" I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.\n",

We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "The same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?\n",

      "\n",
      "-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. \n",
      "\n",
      "-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.\n",

This wasn’t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don’t know and don’t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don’t even know if it can be figured out.\n",

Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\n",

Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\n",

      "Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\n",
      "\n",
      "My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\n",

      "Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\n",

      "***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.\n",

      "1. I didn't post on April First.\n",

That left me to look after their 15 year old daughter Amy. I was perfectly happy to do this, but as most of their wealth was seized for being \"ill gotten\", it's meant that I've been having to care for her out of my own pocket. Once again this doesn't bother me, but it's meant massive life changes for the kid. \n",

      "Firstly, they sent her to a private school. I can't afford anywhere near those fees, so I had to transfer her to a local school.

      "\n",
      "A bigger problem is clothing. Like my sister Amy loves fashion and designer stuff. She's still got a lot of stuff that her parents got her, but she's always on the lookout for new clothes. Unfortunately, I can't afford anywhere near the sort of stuff she likes, and I also have two children of my own whose clothing I have to pay for. I have told my sister this, but she insists I should \"make allowances\" because her daughter is going through a tough time. \n",

He was also insecure and resented that  I have more money than him and own a home whilst he doesn’t, he had made a few comments about this before but I didn’t realise it was such a big issue for him.

Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay. \n",

Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge.

I tried to do my best for him and he got into a good engineering school but at 19, he got his then girlfriend Iza pregnant and they had Annabella together. I've been the one who has mostly raised her (Iza got deported but they spend July together and FT every night). Julius got married to his girlfriend Katja after graduation and they have two wonderful boys together. Annabella lives with me and not with them.\n",

      "The thing is, Julius never spends any time with Annabella. He doesn't even call to say goodnight. But she loves him so much. It's like once a month, he'll show up with a box full of toys, spend a day with her and then go back to his family. It hurts her so much that he doesn't spend time with her because he's her hero. I'm just grandma. And no, he doesn't act this way because of his wife. Katja would love to have Annabella move in with them, she once brought up the idea and she went on about all the things they could do together. She would love to be her stepmom, calls her princess, sweetie and so many nice nicknames. The only reason they haven't is because Julius has said she should stay with me.\n",

I made it clear to him that he needed to bring her on the trip and he just called me an asshole - which he's never done before - for trying to control him. I admit that I was a bit controlling in my reaction but I don't think I went that far.\n",

      "Throwaway. Ok I know the title is confusing but hear me out. I went out to eat with my (34f) bf (35m) and a two other couples. For context I am a mother to a 5yr old (not my bf child). So two tables away was a new parent couple & what I can only assume was the guys parents. I assumed this because I was that girl when I first had my child. Out to dinner with your fathers child and his family and baby is being fussy- you’re struggling and no one is helping you. Baby’s crying for about 15 min now all while the father or no one else for that matter is offering her any help or a break so she can have at least a bite of her food that’s been sitting there cold for about 30 min. I really just wanted to run to her grab the baby for a bit and tell her to eat. \n",

      "This is where I might I have been an asshole:baby’s crying (again no one paying attention) and she goes to comfort baby and breastfeed. Well ALL of a sudden she’s the center of attention! Baby father says what are you doing? That’s disgusting go to a stall in the bathroom! At this point I lost it. My bf was trying to calm me down the entire time telling me it’s none of my business but I just went ham. I got up from my table walked over and told him if he found it so disgusting why doesn’t he go eat his sandwich on the the toilet. I said she has been struggling, hasn’t had a bite to eat all while the 3 of you sit there enjoying yourselves and letting her drown.\n",
      "And then I said loud enough that the tables around could hear that anyone who is offended by a woman breastfeeding needs to get checked because breasts weren’t made for men to suck on for pleasure they were made for feeding and that’s exactly what she’s doing. \n",
      "No one said anything but she also didn’t go to the bathroom and finished feeding her baby who calmed down and she was able to eat. \n",
      "My bf is upset I caused a scene in front of some of his friends and everyone really at the restaurant but I just couldn’t sit back watch, and say nothing. \n",

I saw red, mostly because I have been through exactly this and have gone home in tears and feeling alone. I would normally not get into anyones business. I appreciate all your feedback and for sure next time I feel the urge to say something I’m going to take a breath and find a better way to communicate that doesn’t put anyone in danger or interrupt other people. My bf is still not talking to me until I apologize because again I embarrassed him, regardless of the reason. Feel like I should just send a text to his friends and keep it moving.\n",

      "\n",
      "I mentioned in a previous comment but will say again that the young mom did give me a smile as we were saying our goodbyes in the parking lot and they were leaving. In terms of this situation like I said I could of had more tact and really hope I didn’t expose her to more abuse in retaliation. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for my boyfriend- well now ex because HE BROKE UP (well told me he needed space) with me. I showed him the thread and this is what happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Super pissed that I posted this on here. ‘Why am I putting our business out on the internet?’ And basically I wanted people to turn against him (what?!) and more attention then I already took at the restaurant \n",
      "2. One of his friends is very conservative and while his friend didn’t actually say anything to my ex he says his friend was definitely offended by the breastfeeding at the table because it’s not hygienic. He doesn’t agree that she should have gone to bathroom but it wasn’t the appropriate place to feed.\n",
      "3. One of the things he liked about me was how I kept my ‘mom life’ separate from my relationship with him. And that while he was weirded out that I never invited him to my house the entire time we’ve been dating (2yrs) he appreciated not having to be involved because he has never wanted kids. Doesn’t like them. So basically I set a boundary from the beginning of ‘no kid stuff’ I crossed it at the restaurant and made a big scene in front of his friends who he says were also embarrassed but weren’t going to say anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "So like this is all still going on. I’m a bit sad - like maybe I did do the most- but also I’m like f him. Since me and my daughters dad split 50/50 I can see how someone can see me and not realize that I’m a whole ass mother. The reason I don’t let people I’m dating come to my house is because at the end of the day I don’t know these people from Adam (did you torture animals as a child 🤷🏽‍♀️) and rather than expose my daughter to variables (guys character or behaviors) I prefer if they don’t have access. I know it may sound crazy or weird, but when I was in college a guy I dated would show up to my apartment drunk yelling for me outside my window. So I’m not leaving the door even cracked for something like this to happen and my daughter be home with me. She’d be terrified. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what he said was he needed a break and I just said let’s just not do this at all because it’s not gonna work. For sure I set boundaries with my kid but if anything involving kids is a problem than we aren’t going to work because again I am a mother. And even on my days ‘off’ I’m on call because anything can happen and I need to be there regardless. \n",

I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. \n",

My sister often makes jokes about how all lesbians know each other and how lesbian relationships tend to work. For example; my girlfriend and I were together a year before we moved in together, and my sister joked that \"that's like a decade in Lesbian Years\". My girlfriend asked me about the ex being in the wedding party and why they chose to do so cause it seemed like it would be awkward. I said it isn't for them and she asked why. I just shrugged and said \"I don't know man, lesbians.\" \n",

Their father and I divorced 5 years ago after I learned he was cheating on me. He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay \"friends\" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.\n",

      "What followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.\n",

      "What I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.\n",

Turns out sister’s pregnant and they essentially want me to let her move in for free AND pay for everything for her and the baby. There was no apology for anything.

Thing is, my parents are going to have to take money out of their retirement fund if I don’t help. They were good parents growing up, when my sister started her bs I was already out of the house.

      "In my last post, I stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to \"disown\" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)\n",

I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.\n",

      "I had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*.

I was just too shocked to react initially. \n",

They started saying ridiculous things like they’ve never let her into my room (while apparently Y was allowed) and drawing all sorts of other parallels between X and Y trying to demonstrate why X wasn’t like my sister. They also said stuff like no one can understand me better than X and that she will “keep the family together” while P will “alienate” me from them. They also told me I’m ruining the family.\n",

I also told my parents I won’t ruin my life for them to be able to “keep their word”. X’s father is coming to our house once he’s able to (transport restrictions still in place), but he had a long phone call with parents. I’m sure a LOT of emotional blackmail is to follow, and I already feel rather guilty about X because she’s a nice girl. \n",

I’ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.” I suggested that she take her son (he’s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says “I can’t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I’m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn’t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He’s too smart to manipulate.”\n",

After one too many lectures about how bad Kit Kats are and how I should replace them with bananas, I casually asked her what her excuse was for being at least 50lbs overweight? I reminded her that like every other post on her social media was her at some restaurant or deli or whatever eating something that I wouldn't even eat. She really didn't have an answer except it's not about calories but what's in the food that counts before running off crying and starting WWIII with my brother.

My daughter and I got home and she started crying after noticing the bike was gone. My husband was home at the time, he told me he returned the bike and got money in return to spend on something useful for us since the bike was just there as a \"distraction\" and there was no need for it now since we're the dead of winter. I was aggravated and lost it on him saying it wasn't his, didn't come from him, and he didn't pay for it so he had no right to touch it ESPECIALLY knowing our daughter's been wanting it for a long time and my brother was decent enough to buy it for her despite barely having money to get him by. I told him what he did was theft and insisted he hand over the money to me so I could re-purchase it but he said he spent it on stuff for the house and doesn't have any money left now but I knew about the money he was stashing away in the bedroom that he forbade me from toucing and I took some of it and went out to re-purchase the bike while he was out the next day.\n",

So I corrected them, my surname is Bič (Czech noun meaning “a whip”, happens to be pronounced just like “bitch”). My name is not English and doesn’t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don’t see a problem with my name (and I don’t feel insulted by being called “Mr Bitch”), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like “cunt” in Czech, it’s just how it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well apparently the American group I’m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying “curse words”(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.\n",

Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bič, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it’s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn’t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office’s official language. Nobody has issues with Bič when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)\n",

      "\n",
      "From pretty much the beginning of our relationship, Ana and I have never gotten along. I don’t know how to emphasize that it is NOT because of a lack of trying. She just does not like me. When she was young she was just scared of me and “afraid I’d tear their family apart”. Nowadays it’s more of a neutral dislike rather than strong antipathy so I suppose that’s progress\n",
      "\n",
      "Elise is a stay at home mother, so she relies on me for income. As a result, I pay for everything for Ana. Food. Clothes. Volleyball fees. Field trips. I take an interest in her hobbies. I go to her games. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I try my damn hardest to be the step-father I can. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s so... hard. Always giving me curt 1-word responses. Always having to have an attitude. She does things to get a rise out of me. Staying out late reeking of booze. Always trying to sneak boys in. Typical rebellious stuff. But I always let her know I love her and I’m there for her in hopes of her “shithead teenager” phase pasts. \n",

      "\n",
      "Well anyways, Friday, I came to her room to check her phone and read her messages (not a permanent thing, but she’s been caught sneaking out twice in the last month so this is her punishment). I ask for the phone, she says “no, I’m tired of you checking my shit, leave me alone”. I tell her I’m not asking again and she goes “just fuck off already. You’re not my real dad. You never have been. Stop acting like you can tell me what to do” before getting up and slamming the door. \n",

Like I said, her mom doesn’t work and her dad is a POS so I normally would be the one to cough up the money. Not this time. I responded “go ask your real dad”. I could tell she was hurt. Tears swelled up from her face and she excused herself from the table. \n",

I said if anything’s disrespectful, it’s her treating me like a doormat and a credit card, and I will no longer tolerate this treatment in my house. I told her we don’t have to be friends, but if she can’t at least be cordial to me or respect my position as an authority figure, she can find someone else to pay for her non-essentials. AITA?\n",

I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. \n",

We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. \n",

Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n",
      "\n",

      "They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n",

People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n",

But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that.

      "\n",
      "Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n",

Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it.

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gr8bp3/aita_for_suing_my_girlfriend_after_she_had_my/ I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n",

I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n",
      "\n",
      "HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below.

I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit.

My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver.

In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time.

It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed.

This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. \n",

      "She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her.

      "That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. \n",

My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.\n",

      "\n",
      "About a week after my post I planted a 'wall' of blackberries and raspberries at the 2 sides of my garden facing the driveway, about 30 cm from the edge so no overhanging branches! On the other side of the berry wall I planted lots stuff like strawberries and tomatoes. To reach the tomatoes and strawberries from the driveway you have either go through the fruitbushes or walk up to my house, walk about 2m along the side of the house and my windows and then walk into my actual garden. Not something you do by mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "For about 2 weeks it was somewhat quiet but I still found the kids on my driveway every single days. As far as I know they did not enter the garden and I hadn't noticed them walking around my house anymore, so I figured the bushes were working.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 1 week ago berry season started and my bushes are now full of raspberries and there's lots of strawberries as well. The neighbours noticed. First I caught the boys picking and eating raspberries so I told them off and dropped them off at home, told their mom I caught them stealing (that's how I see it even though it's fruit) and that I'd call the cops next time. She huffed and told me to grow up, but took the boys inside anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that it was quiet up until yesterday afternoon, when I went out for a while and found the dad and his 2 sons right in the middle of my garden when I returned, clearing my bushes and plants. I didn't even confront them, just called the cops from a distance as they hadn't noticed me yet and started filming them after making the call. Luckily 2 cops showed up after 10 minutes or so and they confronted the neighbour as they were still picking berries. They told them they were trespassing and that the berry picking was in fact considered stealing and that I could press charges. For the first time I noticed a bit of fear in my neighbour, he was having trouble finding his words and kept looking back at his house (I guess hoping his wife would show to yell at the cops). They all went inside with the cops, so I just went home as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while the cops came by and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked them if they felt like they scared the neighbour enough to stay away. I got a small smile and yes about him, but the wife had just kept shouting at them and her husband about the 'little bitch' living next door. I told them no for now, asked them if I'd be allowed to get an extra camera set up on the wall between my garden and the road to cover the entire front garden + driveway, they said that's allowed as long as it's on my side of the wall.\n",
      "\n",

      "In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH\"s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more \"girly\". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH\"s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. \n",

I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before.

      "I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. \n",

I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?\n",

I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n",

She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n",

We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n",

I told her that I’m sorry that implying that I’m not her real father, but like it or not that I consider her MY daughter. That I loved her and will always be there for her. She started to cry and sob uncontrollably and said “Why doesn’t he [her biological father] love me?” I held her and told her she didn’t need to fight for his approval. I also apologized for looking through her phone; that I’ve come to accept that it’s not an appropriate punishment for a teenage girl, and I was going to find other alternatives. Lastly I brought up therapy and while she was hesitant at first I let her know it was nothing to be ashamed of, that everything she said at therapy would be entirely confidential, and that it could help to have a confidant to help her sort through her feelings. She sat on this for the day, but the next day let me know that she was ready so I set up the soonest appointment (which was last Friday and her second appointment this afternoon)\n",

She’s been following all of the rules, coming home at a reasonable hour, she’s been less withdrawn and more social even to the point where her brother commented on the change today!

I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.\n",

      "My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.\n",

But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.\n",

But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.\n",

Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim.

It’s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they’ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it’s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fiancé “Rick” were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on & off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn’t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it’s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don’t have actual confirmation if that’s exactly what he was told. All Carla’s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he’s angry at her for never saying anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "It became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they’re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on.

To my surprise she said they still want it at our place. \n",

They’re going to have to find some place else since we’re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn’t make sense. Rick doesn’t want me around because he’s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I’ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I’m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don’t think that I am, it just doesn’t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we’re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it’s the least I can do after everything. AITA?\n",

      "I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to \"Bob\" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after I moved out, she started complaining how \"She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!\" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: \"I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.\n",

My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept \"attitude\" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made.

So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!\" She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made.

I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care.

Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD.

I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen.

Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me.

I spent several years working as a stripper, at the end of which I was able to buy my own flat. I'd been with my boyfriend for about 18 months, and I'm currently around 3 months pregnant. With the news of the baby incoming, my boyfriend said he wanted me to sell my place so we could use the money to get a new place together, and when I refused he called me irrational. I thought I was TA because of that, plus my sister sided with him.\n",

      "Now for the update, because a lot of people asked for one. First off, I dumped him. He initially said that he doesn't want to be a parent if we're not a couple, but earlier this week he told me he wants majority custody so not only does he not have to pay child support, but if he gets majority then *I* end up paying *him* (he actually said that was his reasoning). He also runs his own startup, and admitted the startup is basically done for, and he was hoping that when I sold my place I could also put a cash injection into his business with the money, so basically this was all about money for him (and I have extensive documentation of all of this). There's going to be a legal case, but I've gotten legal advice, and it looks like I'll be able to get sole custody, which is what I intend to go for. In the last couple weeks, my sister has doubled down and is trying to get me to fix things with my ex because \"a baby should have a complete family\", so I've not been involving her in my pregnancy, which she is *furious* about. She also told our parents, which *I* am furious about, so we're not speaking right now.\n",

When I first posted, between my boyfriend and my sister, I was genuinely convinced I was in the wrong, so to have such an overwhelmingly supportive response really helped me realise that I shouldn't doubt myself so much, and with that realisation, plus everything going on right now, I've decided to go to therapy, which I will be starting next week.\n",

      "article https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mmxpzu/aita_for_calling_out_my_kids_future_stepmom_for/ I [29F] dated a guy Joe (30M) for 3 months before he left me to go back to his ex Kim (30F). Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I’m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he’s still with his girlfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Joe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children’s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn’t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn’t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins “the non-traditional way” and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn’t even invited. She also announced that she’s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren’t hers, and that Joe didn’t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I’m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?\n",

We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn’t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn’t my babies home state and I can’t be charged with anything. \n",
      "However, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don’t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there’s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.\n",

So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!\n",
      "* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!\n",
      "* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Also important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own.

I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.

The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n",

He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n",

He was shocked and asked if I was joking, but I was starting to cry a little at this point, so he knew I was serious. My bio-children were very surprised too. He was in tears and asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. I didn't know what to say and said \"I was just trying to protect you, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me\", but unfortunately and understandably, he left.\n",

I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said \"I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before.\" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up.
