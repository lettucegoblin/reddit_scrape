People in the Northern states should probably learn French, though, because of Canada. </p>\n\n<p>Many countries that speak other languages have schools teatching English as a second language, ocasionaly even teatching a third language (not that all students learn both of the languages in the end, or even one, but they still have a basic grasp). It would only make sense if the US had their students learning Spanish. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking two or more languages isn&#39;t just useful because you can talk with more people or even because of the cultural background. It&#39;s also good for the brain, since you learn new concepts and gain a new worldview, and also have to adapt to the different grammar.</p>\n</div>",

I took German through high school and have retained a small amount of what I learned. \n\nWent to Germany this past summer, it was helpful knowing some vocabulary to get around and looking at menus, but pretty much no one would let me speak German. In all fairness, I probably sounded like a drunk four year old, so I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nThe exception to this story is our very first night in Germany. We were staying at an AirBNB in Munich, and thanks to an issue (I caused) with our rental cars we didn\u2019t get in until pretty late. The neighborhood our place was in didn\u2019t have much for food within walking distance except a little bar a block away. It was probably 10PM and it was only the bartender and one regular. \n\nI asked if they were open, and if they had any food. Bartender welcomed us in, and both the regular and the bartender were ecstatic that I wanted to learn German in school. They were very happy to speak slowly and help me with some basic phrases. The regular spoke pretty good English, the bartender wasn\u2019t as fluent, but still pretty good. They spoke English to the friends I was traveling with, but tried to keep it German with me. They were pretty impressed with what I remembered, being that it was 10+ years since I had been in school. \n\nThose two actually made for an awesome reception into Germany after a tiring trip that had some headaches. Super nice guys, very funny, and had a great few hours talking with them. The only other time on that trip where it really helped was our visit to Neuschwanstein. There\u2019s a few hiking trails around the grounds and we decided to go down one. It had started raining pretty heavily and our map got trashed. One of our group members was not having a good time on the hike and wanted to get back to the cars. Some of the trails just lead back to the castle, but one takes you back down to the village/parking area. We were pretty sure we were on the right path to the parking, but found some French backpackers that were going the opposite direction of us and asked if they knew. They didn\u2019t speak English, but they did speak German. They helped get us on the right path and made for a quicker and less frustrating trip back to the cars.",

I know a bit of Italian (more then just basic phrases but not near fluent), but probably 90% of the people I interacted with spoke good English (much better than my Italian) and for the most part would quickly switch to it when they saw I was having trouble trying to say/understand something. Maybe that was just my experience, but I got the impression that Italians' understanding of English is pretty good.\n\nEdit: To everyone replying, I do understand that my experience does not mean that Italians all speak great English or that you don't need to know any Italian words or phrases to travel there (you absolutely should), or that speaking Italian well would not make the experience better or easier. I was just pointing out that I got along very easily and had a great time with my not-very-good Italian, and actually had fewer instances where someone I talked with didn't speak English at all or didn't speak it well than I did when I went to Germany. I understand everyone's mileage may vary, and in the case of all countries it depends a lot on which regions/cities you visit, how you approach locals, etc., but it's not a huge setback if you only speak English fluently. I'm not saying you don't need to make an effort to learn some basic phrases (hello, please, thank you, excuse me, do you speak English, etc) in the local language of wherever you travel, though. You would probably be able to get along just fine without doing that in any of those 4 countries, but you really should at least do that much when visiting any other country.",
