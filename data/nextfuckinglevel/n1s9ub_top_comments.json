I never dealt with transporting cash and I\u2019m sure it can vary a bit, but the general rules of getting away safely are for the most part the same.\n\n1. Despite what most are saying on here, The passenger did a good job, but he could have done better. \n\nHe was unsure of whether they were going to dismount, because in the first few after receiving fire he grabs his weapon to be ready in case they have to step outside. The driver tells him to get the rifle ready (I think) to which he gets it, makes sure there\u2019s a mag inside, and chambers a round so that it is ready to fire. Then a second later he attempts to hand it off because he\u2019s thinks they are both gonna get out (he has his pistol and that's why the driver asked him to get it ready-when in fact that wasn't the case. Driver just wanted rifle to be ready, regardless of what time they got out). When he realizes that isn\u2019t what's happening, he moves the gun away, and stays quiet. He doesn\u2019t ask the entire time \u201cWHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?\u201d \u201cWHERE ARE WE GOING?\u201d \u201cCAN YOU TELL ME THE PLAN?\u201d\nNo, he stays quiet, listens to the more experienced member of the team, and doesn\u2019t distract the driver while he\u2019s in a very stressful situation. People don\u2019t realize that because those cars are armored they are super heavy and the suspension isn\u2019t comfortable, so trying to text with one hand, while holding a gun and while trying to still look up every second or so to know what\u2019s going on makes it super hard to text\u2014 and not to mention fear and nervousness playing a role.\n\n2. Driver was very good and calm for the situation. He focused on the task at hand, while doing his best to guide his partner. \n\nSome of you guys watch too much TV. ** that especially goes to those who said the driver should shoot out of the vehicle. He\u2019d have to open the door and hold it (but even if he didnt have to hold it open) the fact he has nowhere to rest his arm for support while shooting out of a bumpy swerving vehicle to hit another swerving car almost completely negates any benefit of shooting. Also, the fact that the door/windows are closed is why they are still alive. Opening the door for almost any reason is DEATH.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As someone who was in the military and that also did executive protection work in the military (for ex: transporting a General in our Humvee\u2014 of course in a convoy) and in the civilian world doing protection for royalty, celebs or just plain old rich people) I have a few observations. I never dealt with transporting cash and I\u2019m sure it can vary a bit, but the general rules of getting away safely are for the most part the same.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Despite what most are saying on here, The passenger did a good job, but he could have done better. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>He was unsure of whether they were going to dismount, because in the first few after receiving fire he grabs his weapon to be ready in case they have to step outside. The driver tells him to get the rifle ready (I think) to which he gets it, makes sure there\u2019s a mag inside, and chambers a round so that it is ready to fire. Then a second later he attempts to hand it off because he\u2019s thinks they are both gonna get out (he has his pistol and that&#39;s why the driver asked him to get it ready-when in fact that wasn&#39;t the case. Driver just wanted rifle to be ready, regardless of what time they got out). When he realizes that isn\u2019t what&#39;s happening, he moves the gun away, and stays quiet. He doesn\u2019t ask the entire time \u201cWHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?\u201d \u201cWHERE ARE WE GOING?\u201d \u201cCAN YOU TELL ME THE PLAN?\u201d\nNo, he stays quiet, listens to the more experienced member of the team, and doesn\u2019t distract the driver while he\u2019s in a very stressful situation. People don\u2019t realize that because those cars are armored they are super heavy and the suspension isn\u2019t comfortable, so trying to text with one hand, while holding a gun and while trying to still look up every second or so to know what\u2019s going on makes it super hard to text\u2014 and not to mention fear and nervousness playing a role.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Driver was very good and calm for the situation. He focused on the task at hand, while doing his best to guide his partner. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some of you guys watch too much TV. ** that especially goes to those who said the driver should shoot out of the vehicle. He\u2019d have to open the door and hold it (but even if he didnt have to hold it open) the fact he has nowhere to rest his arm for support while shooting out of a bumpy swerving vehicle to hit another swerving car almost completely negates any benefit of shooting. Also, the fact that the door/windows are closed is why they are still alive. Opening the door for almost any reason is DEATH.</p>\n</div>",

Me, wife, kids age 4 and 8.\n\nWe decided to hop the shuttle bus and go walk along the nice pedestrian market style street in Playa Del Carmen.  Beautiful time. \n\nNice family time... we sat down at a cafe patio and had lunch.  We were about 20 Metres from an intersection.  Nothing special.  \n\nSo the angle I had was facing the intersection. I'm sitting there enjoying another cervesa and people watching, relaxing on a sunny day. \n\nA giant tank-like thing rumbled up and stopped in the middle of the intersection on a sort of 45 degree angle.  In a very methodical fashion one at a time guys with full soldier armour came out and took up positions with their backs to the walls around the  entire perimeter.  'Soldiers' on the N,E,S,W corners.  Others in sort of front door cubby spots so they're protected and sheltered. \n\nI counted 6-8 heavily armed, imtimidating and seemingly (to me... Canadian city guy with a desk job) very well trained mercenaries right out of a blockbuster movie. \n\nThey were moving in a very methodical, measured cadence/rhythm.    Something big was going down.  \n\nThe last guy to exit the armoured troop carrier went with a briefcase of sorts - over to the ATM Machine on the corner.  He opened it efficiently.  Put in some mad stacks of money.  Closed it, quickly scooted back into the truck, and then the soldiers backed into the vehicle in exact reverse order - walking backwards at times to cover their tails.  The last guy in shut the door and they departed, probably to go fill the next ATM machine.\n\n\nIt occured to me sitting in this very nice (and fake-ish touristy zone) that if they need a squad of mercenaries to refill an ATM maybe we should just stay on the resort property and not visit again.

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s different for some of these guys, but I&#39;ll never forget his answer, in classic thick, Afrikaans drawl:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;More like two things, eh? First, never exit the vehicle. I&#39;m not kidding, my boy, you try to get away. You never want to get into a shootout. Second, if it is a shootout, get more bullets coming at them than you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I saw this man after work he usually had 3-4 handguns on his person/tactical gear along with two knives that put Crocodile Dundee to shame. I knew he also had a rifle and shotgun in his behemoth of a vehicle. Always made me think of a one man army.</p>\n</div>",
