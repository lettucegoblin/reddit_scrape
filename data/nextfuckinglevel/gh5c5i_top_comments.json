The senior officer (who seemed cool... talked to us about making music, my friend driving was a producer) talks to us telling us that the 1st officer was new and that he was a little too excited. He then uncuffed us, and gave us a warning on the traffic violations. Unfortunately, at the time there was some sort of law that stated you couldn\u2019t transport firearms through the State of Maryland, so they had to arrest his girlfriend and confiscate her legal registered firearm. Me and my friend had to sleep in the police station parking lot until we could bond her out in the morning. It was a super stupid situation.",

The cop freaks the hell out draws out his gun  on us and starts screaming at us... telling my friend to keep his hands gripped on the steering wheel and for his girl to put the gun on the dash and her hands out the window and for me to put my hands on the back of the seat... all while saying don\u2019t make me shoot you. The entire time we  were calm/tired and cooperative. Then while waiting for back up, he orders each of us out the car one by one and handcuffs us on the side of the road. His senior officers show up and relieve him, telling him they\u2019ll take it from there and for him to leave. The senior officer (who seemed cool... talked to us about making music, my friend driving was a producer) talks to us telling us that the 1st officer was new and that he was a little too excited. He then uncuffed us, and gave us a warning on the traffic violations. Unfortunately, at the time there was some sort of law that stated you couldn\u2019t transport firearms through the State of Maryland, so they had to arrest his girlfriend and confiscate her legal registered firearm. Me and my friend had to sleep in the police station parking lot until we could bond her out in the morning. It was a super stupid situation.</p>\n</div>",
