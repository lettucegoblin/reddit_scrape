        "body": "I can't speak for other black people, but growing up, my sister and I were taught that if ANYTHING ever happened to call Mom. If we were hurt, call mom. If someone broke into the house, hide under the bed and call mom. We were taught that the only time we were to call 911 was if there was a fire at home and she wasn't there at the time.\n\nWhen we got a bit older (middle school aged) we were taught about inequality. I remember I used to hate it, my friends would be outside playing and I'd have to spend an hour or two on the weekends learning about our (black) history. I remember when I turned 13, my sister (11 at the time) and I were sat down and had to watch the movie Roots in it's entirety. We were taught that the world isn't always fair and that we will have to work harder than some of our classmates just to get the same results as everyone else. When I turned 15 and a half and got my permit, I was taught that if I was EVER pulled over by the police for ANY reason ever at all, never take my hands off the wheel. Keep my eyes forward and when they ask for license and registration to ask for permission to open the glove box and clearly state that I'm grabbing my registration. \n\nOverall, like I said, I can't speak for other black families, but I can't but help to assume that I wasn't the only one raised this way. Growing up, that was my normal, it wasn't abnormal to fear the police, it was just a normal thing to not trust the system and a normal thing to work twice as hard for everything I wanted or did, ranging from academics to sports. I'm now married with my own family and my own young are getting to the age where I will have to decide on how to convey what I was taught to them. Haven't decided on how to go about it yet, but it's hard and it only makes me appreciate my mom more because I now know how hard it is to see the innocence of a child but also realize that I'd be doing them no favors and actually hurting them by not telling them the truth from a young age about what it's like to grow up black in america.",
