        "body": "It's not a coordinated attack, that's the narrative that Wall Street is pushing. Hedge funds made some very risky investments by trying to get a company to go bankrupt, thinking they were untouchable and nothing was going to happen. People happened to believe the company they were betting on still had the potential to recover and bought their stock. Wall Street's risky position blew up in their face because of it. That's the only story here\n\nEdit: to be clear, people started buying gamestop stock as far back as 2019 believing it had potential to turn around its business and were publicly posting about their belief in the company. Are you going to tell me they \"coordinated an attack\" for the past year and a half? The only coordinating here was by the hedge funds trying to short sell gamestop into bankruptcy. Why do they get to decide if a business gets to exist if consumers still believe in them? They've only continued to double down on their shorts even as the stock price increased, their own greed put them into this position and WSB has done nothing but say WE LIKE THIS STOCK\n\nEdit 2: People are still saying GameStop had no chance of turning around their business, let me point you towards things that indicated otherwise. 1) new consoles were coming out. Historically, GameStop has always had increased business around new console releases and these consoles still had disc drives indicating their manufacturers still thought consumers would like to buy physical discs. GameStop is a major seller of physical game discs. 2) Ryan Cohen, co-founder and former CEO of Chewy.com, bought a 13% stake in the company with a plan to adopt a strategy that would transform the company into a specialized e-commerce seller of gaming products, 3) GameStop signed a multi-year deal with MicroSoft to share revenue for all digital sales on any xboxes they sold. All of these things happened *last year*, long before any talk of a \"short squeeze\", because people saw potential in GameStop. The squeeze came about because hedge funds kept shorting the stock even though GameStop was making these changes. This is the hedge funds fault they're in this",

        "body": "For people who don't understand what's going on: Big hedge funds \"shorted\" 140% of Gamestop shares. WSB picked up on it and started buying those shares.\n\nA \"short\" is essentially when you borrow a stock and sell it at the current price, hoping that the stock price will fall. When its time to return the stock you borrowed, you buy it at the new, lower price and pocket the difference. However, if the price goes up you are still required to buy it at the new, higher price, meaning you lose money. That 140% means that stocks were borrowed, sold, and then the new owner loaned it out again so that there are more shares \"owed\" than owned. The hedge funds are literally required to buy back more shares of the stock than there are in circulation, which would have been fine if Gamestop went bankrupt and those stocks were worth $0 (this is what they were hoping for in the first place, they would have made a bunch of money).\n\nWhat's happening now is people are buying Gamestop shares because they know that hedge funds (Melvin Capital is the big one) are legally required to buy those shares back. That means that the people who own the shares can literally name their price and hedge funds will still have to buy, which is why the price is exploding.\n\nEdit, forgot to add: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 WE LOVE THE STOCK! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

The archetype of the [horned Norseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_helmet#Popular_association_with_Vikings) comes from a 19th century  Romantic-era opera by Richard Wagner called Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung. It has des because Der Nebelungen is masculine in the genitive case). It is more likely and probable that the horn-clad head pieces, if used at all,  were used by priests and clerics or rules---just for ceremonial reasons. This seems to be a recurring trait in the shamanistic pagan world. Example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer_(cave_art)) from paleolithic France. And an example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur#Interpretations) from the Eastern Mediterranean. Another example, we [see this with the Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_Helmet), who oddly enough were on the *receiving* end of Viking foreign policy. \n\nThe use of horns for pagan priests, and pagans in general, became at some point a representation for *all* pagan practices and peoples. Although I dont know the genesis of this, it seems to really have taken off during the period of German romanticism after the creation of Germany in 1871---away to link Germanic (residing in the Reich proper) people to an [ancient warrior past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius#/media/File:Hermannsdenkmal_statue.jpg). Wagner was one of the campion's of this social movement and his take on it was prominent enough that it carried it into our own time. An example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcMCEHcgm0g) being the infamous Bugs Bunny cartoon, *What's Opera Doc?* This is the second best opera-related Bugs Bunny cartoon. The first being *Rabbit of Seville* in which the [back-and-forth](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x301k1t) weapons chase culminating in an impromptu inter-species gay wedding is perhaps the greatest moment in animation history. \n\nBut to the point, sailing on long ships and fighting with horns on your helmet just isn't practical. You poke the eye of your friend and the helmet gets caught in doorways and tapestries of the monastery you are raiding. The Norsemen were scary enough, they didn't need to adorn themselves with horns to instill fear. Potentially the Viking priestly class and rulers could/would have had [ceremonial horn helmets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veks%C3%B8_helmets) for their religious services or coronations. It could be they wanted to adopt the godly symbolism used by pagan Rome (some Roman and other gods were depicted with winged helmets, which is close enough) or their conquered Celtic people, and thus incorporated it into ceremonial attire.  We know they didnt wear them into battle because actual [medieval depictions](https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/) of *die Wikinger* show then *sans* horns. It wasn't something Bjorn and Sven wore while raiding. People who uses them today to virtue signal as Valhalla bound Huskarls are nothing more than anachronistic larpers.",

Lets say you are a company getting started and you want to grow. You want to expand and have new locations and get new product and salespeople and a good CEO, you just really want to get big and make millions. So, what do you need to grow if you are a young American company looking to get big. You need these three things:\n\n#1) Capital\n\n#2) Capital\n\n#3) Capital\n\nThere are other things you need like a good vision and a good CEO and good motivation and all that shit but the hardest thing is start up capital. Thats why the kids of rich people often start companies. They have the start-up capital of their parents. But lets say you were not lucky enough to be born rich. How do you get capital. There are only two ways- loans or equity. Thats it, thats all finance is. The last time I taught Finance I said this, I said there are only two parts of finance- loans and equity. Then I threw the book across the room. Thats literally all finance is. \n\nOkay the first one, loans. That is a decent way to get capital. So you can walk down the street and tell Bank of America hey I am starting ChadOfDoom Popcorn company, its going to be amazing, I need $50,000. They might give it to you but they are going to have a lengthy approval process, ask for all kinds of collateral and also charge you 9% interest. Pretty steep. \n\nThere is one other option, called equity. You can sell of pieces of yourself. If you become big like Game Stop did an investment firm like GameStop did in the early 2000s you can sell off big chunks of yourself and use the money for capital- buying locations and servers and product and hiring good workers, etc. They actually got started with money from Barnes and Noble but then paid them back when they did the initial public offering (ipo). So then there were 18million shares of their company out there. AFter a company gets the start up money all the things you hear about stocks are on the secondary market. So people buying GME all day and night isn't directly helping Gamestop its people making money from the buys and sells. Thats all a stock is, a piece of the company.

Gamestop sold these shares to the public back in 2002, thats when they got their original money. When companies \"go public\" it means that they sell parts of themselves to the public so they can raise capital. So in 2002 they got with an investment bank called Solomon Smith Barney (No longer a firm- financial scandals) and they decided to sell 18million shares at $18 a share. So that $300 million or whatever is all they ever see from the stock. They want it to remain high because it makes it easier to get lending and the CEO and all the officers probably have shares but the company doesn't make any money when you buy a share on TD Ameritrade, you are giving your money to the person that owned it before you. As for books hmm, I love the Freakonomics series for just pop economics, investing maybe some of the Motley Fool books. I actually am more of a believer in like index investing so if you look up some books by John Bogle who started Vanguard, I think that is the right way to do investing, just putting in $100 a month into the Vanguard 500 or QQQ with Nasdaq or whatever. People try to make investing so complicated but look up the stock symbol SPY, its just a basket of the top 500 companies in America. I like it because when a shitty company drops out, say Blockbuster or whatever, they put a new company in its place like Etsy or Tesla, just throwing some growth companies out there. Over time the S&P500 will return 9%, thats the rate of return for the last 90 years. But its even better if you can throw $100 bucks a month into something like that because you make a shit ton of months like March, 2020 when the market comes back. Hope this helps. \n\nDisclaimer: This does not constitute investment advice, invest at your own risk, I am just merely providing information\n\nHere is more about the Gamestop initial public offering if you want to read more: https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-corp-ipo-priced-1800-share\n\nAny more questions ask away, I teach college economics so I absolutely love people understand concepts, its kind of my thing!",

        "body": "You know how people can buy stock for a price, and sell them whenever they want for the market price? Thats the part everyone knows.\n\nShorting, is when someone borrows stocks from someone, and sell it to someone else at the market price, with the obligation of buying them back at one point so the lender gets their stock back. While borrowing the stocks, they pay interest to the lender. The goal of shorting is to borrow stocks, sell them at 100$, wait for the stock price to go down, buy them back at 50$, and give them back to the original lender. That way, the people shorting made 50$ profit, minus interest.\n\nMany big hedge funds apparently do that, while manipulating the market to make sure the stock goes down.\n\n~~Naked short is when the amount of borrowed stock is bigger than the total amount of stocks.~~ For example, Gamestop has 1000 stocks, yet there are 1400 stocks being shorted. My understanding is that people can short stocks that are already being shorted. So a stock can be borrowed and shorted in chain, leading to 140% shorting.\n\nThe problem here, is that these companies are obligated to buy the options back at one point, no matter the price. There are no time limits per say, but if the total price of stocks you have to buy back equals your available money, you are obligated to buy at whatever the price is and declare bankruptcy. But since 140% of stocks are being shorted, if the price goes up, and people want to bail out of the stocks before it goes up too much, you have more people trying to buy than available stocks.\n\nWallstreetbets people notice that, and decided to make use of that situation. They started buying and buying whatever they could, and never selling. Because of that, the very few people selling increase the price of the stock. As the price goes up, the shorter panic, and tries to buy even more, and the price skyrocket to the moon. As long as WSB doesn't sell, the price will keep going up, and the shorters loses billions.\n\nEventually, when all the shorters will be dead, the price of GME will crash back down to its natural value. In the meantime, the big companies that kept manipulating the market for years, are getting it done to them by normal people, and are angry. They are trying to illegally manipulate everything they can to stop it.\n\nEDIT: read below for an accurate definition of naked shorting",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You know how people can buy stock for a price, and sell them whenever they want for the market price? Thats the part everyone knows.</p>\n\n<p>Shorting, is when someone borrows stocks from someone, and sell it to someone else at the market price, with the obligation of buying them back at one point so the lender gets their stock back. While borrowing the stocks, they pay interest to the lender. The goal of shorting is to borrow stocks, sell them at 100$, wait for the stock price to go down, buy them back at 50$, and give them back to the original lender. That way, the people shorting made 50$ profit, minus interest.</p>\n\n<p>Many big hedge funds apparently do that, while manipulating the market to make sure the stock goes down.</p>\n\n<p><del>Naked short is when the amount of borrowed stock is bigger than the total amount of stocks.</del> For example, Gamestop has 1000 stocks, yet there are 1400 stocks being shorted. My understanding is that people can short stocks that are already being shorted. So a stock can be borrowed and shorted in chain, leading to 140% shorting.</p>\n\n<p>The problem here, is that these companies are obligated to buy the options back at one point, no matter the price.
