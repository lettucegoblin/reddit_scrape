I've got no love for racists but I have just as little for all of the left wing wokescolds who love assigning that shit to me as though there aren't a thousand of us who want nothing but mutual respect and shared prosperity for every single person we share this country with for every idiot who never got the memo that racism is stupid.\n\nI'm dead fucking serious. Every black or brown person in this country needs to strap up just as hard as the average country redneck, and if someone physically attacks you for speaking a different language or having a different skin color than they have, just empty the magazine into them, reload, then empty it again for good measure to make sure we are rid of them. Nobody will miss them, and as soon as the rest of the actual racists out there learn that nobody in this country is going to miss them when they're gone, they'll be afraid of committing acts of racist violence against their fellow citizens, so that minorities in this country won't have to be afraid of being attacked by racists.\n\nIn exchange, stop putting that shit on all of us. This includes people who don't buy into left-wing politics. Stop labeling every conservative as a racist just because we don't agree with socialist policies and ideologues that go completely against everything that has made this country the most prosperous society in the history of the planet. \n\nInstead of calling every system racist and demanding that we tear it all down to replace it with a system that has killed a hundred million people over the last hundred years everywhere it's been tried, try trusting today's generation of white Americans to understand how stupid and wrong-headed previous generations were regarding race, and assume that 99.9% of people you meet TODAY want you to be successful and prosperous - and are only as afraid of being judged poorly by you based on prejudices against them as you are of them doing the same.\n\nBecause in the end that's what racism has always been. Everyday racism is driven by the fear that someone is going to hold negative opinions of you in a way that causes them to hate you and want you to fail. You don't form negative opinions about groups of people unless you think they hold a set of values that represents a threat to you. White supremacy is based on the idea that minorities represent a threat to white people just like wokescold left wing identity politics paints \"whiteness\" as a perpetual threat to people of color.\n\nThe way to break that cycle is by refusing to buy into it. Understand that the worst examples are the exception to the rule, and that the whole reason those examples get the attention they do in the media is because they are aberrations that every reasonable person responds to with horror and disgust.\n\nIf white people had understood this 400 years ago then slavery in America never would have happened. If they'd figured it out even 100 years ago we would likely have repaired all the damage that slavery caused without the need for the Civil Rights movement to force us to finish the job.\n\nBut the vast majority of people understand this now. There are whole generations full of white people on the left who are ashamed to be white because of things they had no control over. Even conservatives who don't buy into that shame understand and recognize the fact that past generations were operating on ideas about race that were stupid and evil - they only (correctly) assert that NONE OF US should be judged by anything other than our own actions as individuals, and that ending racism can only happen when NOBODY is made to feel ashamed of their own race by virtues of the worst examples that can be associated with us, because stereotyping is wrong no matter who you're applying stereotypes to.",
