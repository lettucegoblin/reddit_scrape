I have worked with hundreds (probably thousands) of colleagues during those years, who have also worn masks. Not a single one us of became ill, passed out or died from lack of oxygen. Not a single one of us became ill, passed out or died from breathing too much carbon dioxide. Not a single one us of became ill, passed out or died from rebreathing a little of our own exhaled air. Let\u2019s begin here by putting those scare tactics to rest!\n(It is true that some people, with advanced lung diseases, may be so fragile that a mask could make their already-tenuous breathing more difficult. If your lungs are that bad, you probably shouldn\u2019t be going out in public at the present time anyway; the consequences if you are exposed to Covid-19 would likely be devastating.)\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, you ask, \u201ccan\u2019t viruses go right through the mask, because they are so small?\u201d (\u201cMasks keep viruses out just as well as a chain link fence keeps mosquitoes out,\u201d some tell us.) It is true that individual virus particles can pass through the pores of a mask; however, viruses don\u2019t move on their own. They do not fly across the room like a mosquito, wiggle through your mask like a worm, or fly up your nose like a gnat. The virus is essentially nothing more than a tiny blob of genetic material. Covid-19 travels in a CARRIER \u2013 the carrier is a fluid droplet- fluid droplets that you expel when you cough, sneeze, sing, laugh, talk or simply exhale. Most of your fluid droplets will be stopped from entering the air in the room if you are wearing a mask. Wearing a mask is a very efficient way to protect others if you are carrying the virus (even if you don\u2019t know that you are infected). In addition, if someone else\u2019s fluid droplets happen to land on your mask, many of them will not pass through. This gives the wearer some additional protection, too. But, the main reason to wear a mask is to PROTECT OTHERS. Even if you don\u2019t care about yourself, wear your mask to protect your neighbors, co-workers and friends!\n\nA mask is certainly not 100% protective. However, it appears that the severity of Covid-19 infection is at least partially \u201cdose-dependent.\u201d In other words, the more virus particles that enter your body, the sicker you are likely to become. Why not decrease that volume if you can? \u201cWhat have you got to lose?!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t a requirement or a request to wear a mask violate my constitutional rights?\u201d You\u2019re also not allowed to go into the grocery store if you are not wearing pants. You can\u2019t yell \u201cfire\u201d in the Produce Department. You\u2019re not allowed to urinate on the floor in the Frozen Food Section. Do you object to those restrictions? Rules, established for the common good, are component of a civilized society.\n\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t masks uncomfortable?\u201d Some would say that underwear or shoes can be uncomfortable, but we still wear them. (Actually, being on a ventilator is pretty darned uncomfortable, too!) Are masks really so bad that you can\u2019t tolerate them, even if they will help keep others healthy?\n\n\u201cBut won\u2019t people think I\u2019m a snowflake or a wimp if I wear a mask?\u201d I hope you have enough self-confidence to overcome that.\n\n\u201cBut won\u2019t I look stupid if I wear a mask?\u201d I\u2019ve decided not to dignify that question with an answer!! \ud83d\ude42\n\n\u201cBut I never get sick; I\u2019m not worried.\u201d Well, then, wear a mask for the sake of the rest of us who are not so perfect!\n\nThere is good evidence that masks make a real difference in diminishing the transmission of Covid-19. Please, for the sake of others (and for the sake of yourself), wear your mask when in public. It won\u2019t kill you!\n\nP.S. - And, by the way, please be sure that BOTH your nose and mouth are covered!\"",

They're obviously ignorant and acting in life in a broken manner that doesn't properly reflect the truth, but how are you going to solve it?\n\nIt's an ideology; it's a belief taken on faith. It's done by people on both the right and the left.\n\nI wear a mask. People should wear masks. What you're saying about it being a common courtesy is completely sound, but you're missing the point:\n\nThe point is that you weren't wearing a mask if you had to go out when you had the flu or the cold. You never did. Almost nobody did. You're ALMOST giving the other side a pass here, saying it's fine if they don't want to believe that the doctors are right about this virus, but then you redact it when you declare the notion that even if you think they're wrong, it doesn't hurt to wear a mask anyway...\n\nWhich is exactly what you never did when you had a cold or the flu.\n\nYou're not creating proper correlation here. This isn't about common courtesy. People aren't walking around in droves thinking, \"wow, this is a deadly virus that I could potentially have and not even know it, that is dramatically contagious, and people have been quite literally DYING from it in droves, but fuck them, I'm not wearing a mask.\"\n\nThey're saying something more along the lines of, \"this leftist propaganda is outrageous. The media is filled with lies and you can't believe a damned thing you hear. This virus isn't deadly, it's not even as dangerous as the common cold. This is all leftist nonsense made to strip our freedoms in a political power play for the Democrats.\"\n\nHow do you argue with that? It's basically like trying to reason out that God doesn't exist to a Jehovah's Witness. I know, I've tried.\n\nAt that point you're not even arguing the same thing anymore. The belief in these things becomes so firmly founded that the entire world around them could show them how much they're wrong and they'll plug their ears, close their eyes, start to scream, and not allow what they're seeing or hearing even be processed anymore.\n\nThat's what you're dealing with, but you don't seem to get it. The problem is that politics and the media are SO RAMPANT with lies, the pushing of ideologies, political agendas, and propaganda, that it's sometimes impossible for people to believe anything anymore. So who do they turn to? They turn to their friends and family who they trust. Did those people get that info from a media sources that's probably full of shit? Ya, probably, but that's not the point, the point is, someone they trust gave them that information, even if the person they trust got it from an unreliable source.\n\nPeople these days are so much more prone to trust their friends and family than any aspect of the media, and it's the media's fault for being pathetic liars who couldn't impartially present the facts if it was the only way to stop the extinction of the entire human race.\n\nMan, I'm full of rants today, lol.",

But do you truly believe that a fabric mask that you buy online or make yourself is going to keep out virus particles that are smaller than bacteria? Do you forget that fabric masks have holes in them that are large enough for viruses to undoubtedly get through?\nAnd sure, I've heard the argument that masks aren't supposed to protect you, they're meant to protect those around you, so that any cough or sneeze you make is captured inside of the mask. This seems fine in practice, but think about the projectile force behind a cough or a sneeze. You are shooting out viruses each time you cough or sneeze, and it is likely that a large portion of the virus you cough or sneeze out is going to get through the mask, just like they can with you breathing normally.\n\nI don't care if people want to wear masks, that's their freedom of choice. But when entire cities or states force people to wear masks, I do believe it's encroaching on freedom. Studies have shown that fabric masks do next to nothing to prevent the spread of viruses, so forcing people to wear them doesn't stop the spread. It's just forcing people to wear something that restricts their ability to breathe. If masks weren't so harmful in that they force you to breathe in your own carbon dioxide (which isn't healthy) and restrict your ability to breathe, and/or actually helped stop the spread, I would not have an issue with it. But they don't do jack, which is why I believe forcing people to wear them is wrong. \n\nhttps://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/christopher-labos-cloth-masks-given-the-ok-but-do-they-work\nhttps://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/data-do-not-back-cloth-masks-limit-covid-19-experts-say\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2240288-do-face-masks-work-against-the-coronavirus-and-should-you-wear-one/\n\nOh and, I can't wear a mask anyways according to the CDC. I should not be wearing one because I have a respiratory disease. I have asthma and wearing a mask restricts my already restricted ability to breathe.

They have leveraged cultural divides and the media to partition people into roughly two buckets who each view the other as the enemy, and shit like wearing masks being political only exists as fuel to that fire. Those partitions fill up more and more every passing year, and almost any issue can easily be made political with how irrational and emotional people who fall into those buckets react to political topics, particularly today driven by the over saturated media influence in our culture. Both parties are completely in on media spin and, put frankly, propaganda. It's a remarkably dangerous thing.\n\nThis isn't new either. It's been going on a long time to some degree or another, but really started taking place in the early 90s, which is also around the time the Democratic party transitioned to being corporate focused instead of people focused, which was the Republicans domain for a while. America lost any real representation for ordinary people, and it showed. Policies were made for business first. They were designed to funnel money to the wealthy and rich. But the last decade, fueled by Citizens United, and the ubiquity of social media, we've seen the culture wars be ramped up to 11.\n\nEach party gives talking points and appeasement to some subset of culture.

We have fundamental systemic issues in our society, and they're perpetuated by both of the parties as tools to simply run election campaigns on, and not fundamentally fix, because the actual fix will not be profitable for them. Systemic issues don't get resolved by the people using those issues to further their goals, and far too many people, on this site at least, don't want to wake up to acknowledge that both sides are part of that system. The best bet for change is through the formation of an entirely new party, but that's difficult. The next best bet are the Democrats, but they'll never do a thing, like they never really have before, to fundamentally change anything without us focusing on the actual problems and applying constant pressure.
