        "body": "I think the most important misconception most of us were taught in school and is downright wrong (specially if you were taught by religious people) is that many scientific facts are \u201cactually just a theory\u201d\n\nA theory is just the name the scientific community gives to a set of principles that can be proven by observation.\n\nWhat we call theory on the day to day is what the scientific community calls \u201chypothesis\u201d, which is something that is yet to be observed.\n\nAlso, here\u2019s a few from r/badwomensanatomy:\n\n* The hymen is not actually an indication of virginity. There is no empirical way to determine a woman\u2019s virginity\n\n* Bleeding is also not a sign of \u201cfirst time sex\u201d, not a direct consequence of ruptured hymen and, like any bleeding, is very much not \u201ca normal thing\u201d, if you or your partner starts bleeding during sex, something is not going the way it should\n\n* Urinary Tract Infections are much more common for women than most men think, and not a sign of bad hygiene. There\u2019s a lot going on down there, from friction to bacteria to rubber to lubricants to semen. It\u2019s not unusual for something wrong to make it\u2019s way up there.\n\nAnd a few from a biologist friend:\n\n* Most bats are not blind, really. They primarily use echolocation but still have sight, and most large bat species actually have very good night aight\n\n* Muscular pain doesn\u2019t happen because of \u201clactic acid building up on the surface of the muscle tissue\u201d. It\u2019s the result of trauma of your fibers being ruptured and regenerate, which leads to soreness like any other regenerative process. Lactic acid doesn\u2019t \u201cjust lay there\u201d for days on end.\n\n* There is no \u201coverthrowing the alpha\u201d ritual on wolf packs. The males of the pack actually look out for their brethren, and when the alpha grows too old or dies, the hierarchy kinda sorts itself out without much infighting\n\n* Female Praying Mantises don\u2019t actually eat their partners after intercourse. Males and females are equally likely to eat their partners, and this can happen regardless of intercourse.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the most important misconception most of us were taught in school and is downright wrong (specially if you were taught by religious people) is that many scientific facts are \u201cactually just a theory\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A theory is just the name the scientific community gives to a set of principles that can be proven by observation.</p>\n\n<p>What we call theory on the day to day is what the scientific community calls \u201chypothesis\u201d, which is something that is yet to be observed.</p>\n\n<p>Also, here\u2019s a few from <a href=\"/r/badwomensanatomy\">r/badwomensanatomy</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The hymen is not actually an indication of virginity. There is no empirical way to determine a woman\u2019s virginity</p></li>\n<li><p>Bleeding is also not a sign of \u201cfirst time sex\u201d, not a direct consequence of ruptured hymen and, like any bleeding, is very much not \u201ca normal thing\u201d, if you or your partner starts bleeding during sex, something is not going the way it should</p></li>\n<li><p>Urinary Tract Infections are much more common for women than most men think, and not a sign of bad hygiene. There\u2019s a lot going on down there, from friction to bacteria to rubber to lubricants to semen. It\u2019s not unusual for something wrong to make it\u2019s way up there.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And a few from a biologist friend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Most bats are not blind, really. They primarily use echolocation but still have sight, and most large bat species actually have very good night aight</p></li>\n<li><p>Muscular pain doesn\u2019t happen because of \u201clactic acid building up on the surface of the muscle tissue\u201d. It\u2019s the result of trauma of your fibers being ruptured and regenerate, which leads to soreness like any other regenerative process. Lactic acid doesn\u2019t \u201cjust lay there\u201d for days on end.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no \u201coverthrowing the alpha\u201d ritual on wolf packs. The males of the pack actually look out for their brethren, and when the alpha grows too old or dies, the hierarchy kinda sorts itself out without much infighting</p></li>\n<li><p>Female Praying Mantises don\u2019t actually eat their partners after intercourse. Males and females are equally likely to eat their partners, and this can happen regardless of intercourse. They\u2019re just cannibalistic sometimes</p></li>\n<li><p>We don\u2019t eat x spiders per year (I\u2019ve heard 8, 10 and even 30) on average while we sleep.
