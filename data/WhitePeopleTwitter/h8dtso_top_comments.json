Let's not even get into the administrative issues of why it's an awful idea to have like ten decentralized policing forces (one for traffic, one for robberies, etc.). You don't need a 4 year degree to do a traffic stop that doesn't end in a bloodbath. You can have officers that specialize into different aspects of policing after their induction and basic training. Not every officer needs to have immediate access to a semi-automatic rifle. You can do all of this; other countries do it ALL THE TIME. Drop the American exceptionalism for a moment and look at how other countries are managing stuff you have issues with.\n\nBefore you attempt to completely reinvent the wheel you should at least try to address the reasons your cops have ended up being paramilitary jackboots. Demilitarize the police, address toxic 'operator' and 'thin blue line' culture, require extensive de-escalation training, maintain strict rules of engagement when using lethal or less-than-lethal force. Empower regulatory oversight, protect whistleblowers and effectively punish those who ignore the rules.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You have a huge force of paramilitary jackboots who frequently escalate fairly innocuous situations into lethal violence and your conclusion is: &quot;fine, let&#39;s keep them for lethal violence, you know for bank robbers and serial killers, we&#39;ll hire some other people to do traffic policing&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve correctly identified the problem of a militarized and warrior culture police and came to the exact reverse of a solution. Let&#39;s not even get into the administrative issues of why it&#39;s an awful idea to have like ten decentralized policing forces (one for traffic, one for robberies, etc.). You don&#39;t need a 4 year degree to do a traffic stop that doesn&#39;t end in a bloodbath. You can have officers that specialize into different aspects of policing after their induction and basic training. Not every officer needs to have immediate access to a semi-automatic rifle. You can do all of this; other countries do it ALL THE TIME. Drop the American exceptionalism for a moment and look at how other countries are managing stuff you have issues with.</p>\n\n<p>Before you attempt to completely reinvent the wheel you should at least try to address the reasons your cops have ended up being paramilitary jackboots. Demilitarize the police, address toxic &#39;operator&#39; and &#39;thin blue line&#39; culture, require extensive de-escalation training, maintain strict rules of engagement when using lethal or less-than-lethal force. Empower regulatory oversight, protect whistleblowers and effectively punish those who ignore the rules.</p>\n</div>",

It's not 1000 hours of pure theory and book study.\n\nThe requirement to become a police officer is 720 hours of training.  This is all theory, coursework and study, with some hand to hand and pistol training, plus driving instruction.  However, that includes no actual practice.  You are not actually enforcing the law, just learning *how to* enforce the law.\n\nOnce you are done with that training, you do not immediately become a cop operating on your own, with your own beat.  No, instead you become a Student Officer and are then given jurisdiction specific training at your precinct.  In Seattle, this is an additional four weeks of training, or 160 hours, bringing us up to 880 hours.\n\nThen you enter the Field Training Program.  This is an apprenticeship with an experienced officer.  You ride along, you learn on the job, doing the actual practice of policing.  This is four months, and assuming no overtime (unlikely), would be an additional  640 hours, for a total of 1520 hours.\n\nAlso, barber license requirements are *total bullshit* designed to limit the number of licenses and protect barbers from competition.

        "body": "I do want to point out that de funding the police won't really result in demilitarization. A lot of the military gear they get is free or sold at an extreme discount because they are often surplus or hand me down things that the US military doesn't need anymore. Look up the 1033 program for more info on that. LAPD didn't pay for the desert camo MRAPs they have, they were surplus vehicles that were given to them instead of being destroyed. And a lot of the nice kit that you see like $600 EOTech holographic sights on M4A4 carbines were purchased as military surplus at a price that a normal civilian would buy a budget AR-15 and optic at. \n\nI think that re-focus the police would be a better way to explain what needs to happen. In every department the largest expense by far is payroll and training, followed by gas and transportation, followed by service pistols tasers and beanbag cannons, and finally SWAT/riot gear and other kit in that realm. \n\nSpending money on community outreach events like casual cookouts where members of the police force get to know members of the public and befriend them would go a really, really long way in dissolving that hostile attitude that modern police seem to carry. It didn't used to be that way in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Think of Andy Griffith's relationship with the people in his town.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I do want to point out that de funding the police won&#39;t really result in demilitarization. A lot of the military gear they get is free or sold at an extreme discount because they are often surplus or hand me down things that the US military doesn&#39;t need anymore. Look up the 1033 program for more info on that. LAPD didn&#39;t pay for the desert camo MRAPs they have, they were surplus vehicles that were given to them instead of being destroyed. And a lot of the nice kit that you see like $600 EOTech holographic sights on M4A4 carbines were purchased as military surplus at a price that a normal civilian would buy a budget AR-15 and optic at. </p>\n\n<p>I think that re-focus the police would be a better way to explain what needs to happen.

At the same time, having an occupying force strains the bonds of trust within a community.\n\nHowever, my objection to the discipline you're promoting is based on 2 things:\n\n1. As an infantryman, most of my guys' weapon discipline has been really good, but it's because we trained constantly and we would be the ones who need to apply the ROE - not the line cook or supply chief. I don't want police to be trained constantly for weapon discipline, unless we're talking about a real-deal SWAT team that is only ever called in for something like a hostage situation. I want them to be trained in de-escalation or problem-solving.\n\n2. Sometimes the muscle memory drilled into you by training (part of the discipline) will override abiding by ROE.\n\nEven when a non-combat arms MOS is dealing with any locals during an occupation, they are usually guarded by heavy firepower.",
