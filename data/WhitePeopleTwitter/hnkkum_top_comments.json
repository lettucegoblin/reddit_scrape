Japan is not the example people think they\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s South Korea, and even they\u2019ve made some silly mistakes (not quarantining Daegu initially, not closing churches and gyms, not allowing people to work from home). This has more to do with a romanticized version of Japan that people have in their heads than it does with reality.\n\nEDIT: For reference, Japan has a population of 126 million people and has done 518,000 tests.

Sadly there\u2019s barely anyone I\u2019m even interested in voting for because nothing ever changes and it fills me with pessimism and an existential dread for the rest of my life, my children\u2019s lives, everyone else on the planet in the foreseeable future. It turns me off talking about it, so I spend my days talking about science, because to me that\u2019s the only thing that promises improvement, a brighter future, any optimism I have has come from my parents, my friends and science. Come to think of it, the only person I would feel comfortable handing the entire planet off to is Elon Musk.

Those two can\u2019t even hold in their poop because their sphincters are too loose from some puppet master\u2019s hands up there, it is literally the least free, free country I\u2019ve ever heard claim how much freedom they have. Europe is decent, but not perfect either, but still more free from a lot of the bullshit that\u2019s going on over there. I feel like patriotism is just a way for prisoners to remind themselves what home feels like and to distract themselves from how uncomfortable they have made their own situation. Like \u201cyay, we accidentally invented large scale international terrorism because oil, and now we are free because we send our kids to kill their kids and our explosions are american but theirs are evil\u201d. \n\nEducation can open people\u2019s eyes to reality, and it is depressing af. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congrats, you win absolutely nothing. That\u2019s how life is and I want to change it, but I feel helpless. I\u2019m sad because I feel like I can\u2019t change my reality or anyone elses, but I have a strong urge to want to help others, I just don\u2019t know how, or what the point is if it makes no difference for anyone beyond those I try to help.\n\nEdit: this sounds like an alcohol fueled manifesto, but I\u2019m just run down by this half a year.",

Fuck it, it would be funny as shit and a lot more bearable than watching two old men fight for some boring useless small office in a small city in a small White House to be \u201cin charge\u201d of some country claiming to be the greatest country that ever was or will be lmao, every other large empire in history would tell the US to get fucked if they were still around to see what all the fuss is about. Those two can\u2019t even hold in their poop because their sphincters are too loose from some puppet master\u2019s hands up there, it is literally the least free, free country I\u2019ve ever heard claim how much freedom they have. Europe is decent, but not perfect either, but still more free from a lot of the bullshit that\u2019s going on over there. I feel like patriotism is just a way for prisoners to remind themselves what home feels like and to distract themselves from how uncomfortable they have made their own situation. Like \u201cyay, we accidentally invented large scale international terrorism because oil, and now we are free because we send our kids to kill their kids and our explosions are american but theirs are evil\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Education can open people\u2019s eyes to reality, and it is depressing af. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congrats, you win absolutely nothing. That\u2019s how life is and I want to change it, but I feel helpless. I\u2019m sad because I feel like I can\u2019t change my reality or anyone elses, but I have a strong urge to want to help others, I just don\u2019t know how, or what the point is if it makes no difference for anyone beyond those I try to help.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this sounds like an alcohol fueled manifesto, but I\u2019m just run down by this half a year.</p>\n</div>",
