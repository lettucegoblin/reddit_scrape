And voting absentee was an absolute fiasco, the postal service doesn't serve my apartment complex very well so it took a month and a half between submitting my absentee ballot request and actually getting my ballot - plus to submit the request you needed to have access to a printer and mailing supplies, and they closed the public library printer and the in-person absentee ballot requests at the board of elections due to COVID. Compare this to my grandma, who had someone come to her nursing home and help them all register for absentee ballots. If my state hadn't expanded the date range to vote absentee, my vote wouldn't have counted at all. Oh, and early voting at the board of elections is a bit over 30 minutes away by car, and quite a bit longer by bus because it's off in west bumblefuck, and apparently there was such a huge line to vote early that I would have been stuck waiting for hours - which I really can't afford to do because two minimum wage jobs and I don't get vacation time.\n\nThere's very real, systemic barriers in place to keep young people from voting.

John Adams made it to 90, and plenty of early presidents made it into their 80s.  Life expectancy and average age has definitely gone up, but not *that* considerably.  \n\nThe reason that you see things like the average life expectancy was in the 30s in the early 1800s isn't because everyone was dropping dead at 50, its because plenty of women died in childbirth and because infant mortality was through the roof.  Advancements in child care and birthing is whats contributed to the significant rise in life expectancy, not that everyone is living to be Methuselah.  That isn't to say congresses average hasn't gone up, it clearly has, but presidents have never been young on average.",

All so lucky and coddled then wanting to brag about their \u2018accomplishments.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I\u2019m sure neither of us expect or assume we\u2019d get handed anything from family or like we just deserve it. But at the same time, I really doubt our grandparents worked hard their entire life to have ONE person use it all on themselves for trips and vacation houses, and leave none for the rest of the family. </p>\n\n<p>Boomers think everything is for them and they are just owed everything, because that\u2019s how their entire life has been. All about them them them. The idea of passing it on or thinking of others close to them is so foreign that it doesn\u2019t even cross their mind. </p>\n\n<p>My moms never really had a full time 9-5 type job her entire life either, but feels fully qualified to say how easy it is to find a job and how they all pay really well. But what else do you expect from someone living in their own little reality bubble that the rest of us don\u2019t. </p>\n\n<p>Taken care of by her parents, then my dad, then stepdad, then again by the parents when they passed and left everything to her (money, houses, businesses, etc - which like I said have basically all been sold to fund her lavish lifestyle)</p>\n</div>",
