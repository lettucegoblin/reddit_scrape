All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

No Politics\n* Political videos\u2014including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)\u2014should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.\n\n* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.\n\n#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views\n\n* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts\n\n* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. \n\n* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.\n\n* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.\n\n* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.\n\n* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout\n\n#9. No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.\n](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)\n\n#10. No Self Promotion\n\n* *\"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.\"* - Confucius\n\n* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.\n\n\n---\n###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)\n\n#Removals & Warnings\n* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.\n\n* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*\n\n* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. \n\n* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos.

Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval.

Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform.

No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of \"that is next level\" from viewers.\n\n#Use A Descriptive Title\nWrite a clear title for your content that describes the post well. If your title is ill-defined your post may be removed. For example posting CGI content without the mention of it being CGI will result in a removal.\n\n#Avoid Common Reposts\nPosts that have been posted recently to /r/nextfuckinglevel should not be posted repeatedly. If a post has done well on the sub within the past few months it should not be posted again.\n\n#Be Respectful to Others\nTreat others in the subreddit politely and do not troll or harass anyone. This includes slurs and hate speech, which will prompt a ban. We welcome positivity above all.\n\n#Avoid Spam\nDo not post multiple times to this subreddit in a short amount of time. Repeated spam will be moderated.\n\n#Link directly to the content\nYour post (gifs, videos) must be directly linked to the content.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

References through text, balance, snapping, and colour are not accepted. The mod team may make occasional exceptions to this rule at their own discretion.\n\n- Rule 1b. Context cannot be in the title. If the meme caption is in the title or the post makes no sense without the title, it will be removed.\n\n- R-2a. Low effort/quality posts will be removed. This includes unaltered video clips, photos of people coloured purple, etc.\n\n- R-3a. Do not add spoilers in the post title or the post body without a spoiler tag.\n\n- R-3b. The spoiler period lasts 3 weeks after the movie has been released in the theatres.\n\n- R-4. NSFW/NSFL content is not allowed. This includes all nudity regardless of whether genitalia is shown. Breaking this rule will result in an immediate permaban.\n\n- R-5a. Reposts of posts less than 1-month-old will be removed. Please check Hot and New before posting. Crossposting is allowed and encouraged.\n\n- R-5b. Templates are allowed as long as they are not a direct copy/paste of the originals.\n\n- R-6. Follow the Reddit TOS in both posts and comments. Incivility, asking for votes, using Reddit as a marketplace, and brigading will result in an immediate permaban.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101), and visit [/r/Newtoreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) \n\n---\n\n# Rules\n*hover for details*\n\n|||\n|:------|:---|\n|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden. [Read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10.3A_no_social_media_or_electronic_messaging_content.).

[Click here!](https://www.reddit.com/user/funny_mod/m/funnyplus)\n\n---\nPlease note:\n\n* Hate speech and bigotry will be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\n* Bots and bot-like accounts are not allowed.\n\n* No link shorteners (or HugeURL) in either post links or comments. They will be deleted regardless of intent.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

You'll also get updates on the meme market, and be able to collaborate with other fellow meme traders analysing the new memes on the block.\n\n*****\n\nThis sub is not ***only*** for templates. It is for memes in general, themed in an economic perspective. Though, this is not a dumping ground for your low effort memes, please refrain from posting them here.\n\n***\n\n###***[Send us your suggestions here!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMemeEconomy)***\n\n###***[Join the new Discord here!](https://discord.gg/MSsVu8E)***\n\n###***[Unsure how to use the Bot? Look here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/wiki/index)***\n\n***\n\n#### [**Rules:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/rules/)\n\nRule|Description\n:-:|:-:\n1. Appraisal Requests|If a post wishes to request investors' opinion of an old template, it must EXPLICITLY state in the title that it is an appraisal request, and flair it as so. Failure to do will be seen as an attempt to post regular memes, and will be immediately removed.\n2. Create Original and Quality Content|MemeEconomy is a subreddit focused on brainstorming/discovering new formats that: * Are versatile * Have some level of quality * Have originality.But posts that do not belong here are those that are:* Spam * Memes that have little to no use * Old, done-to-death memes * Low effort content (e.g. unoriginal templates).Moderators are able to remove low-effort memes subject to their discretion, including overdone formats, which have been oversaturated and their market value is next to nothing.\n3. No Blatant, Direct Reposts|Reposting in the sense that you take a post from another meme subreddit, copy and paste the image to this subreddit and call it a day is **not allowed**.However, if a new template got popular somewhere else on Reddit, and you were to only take the template and **transform it in a good way**, that would be fine, but make sure you give credit to the user who first made the template. Posting old MemeEconomy posts is **also not allowed.**\n4. No Advertising|Instant and *possibly permanent* bans will be dished out for making a post, or a comment out of the blue which its\u2019 only purpose is to promote some form of product, service or person.**We're not Google Ads.**\n5. No Market Manipulation / Alt Accounts|Please respect the economy. Sharing economic exploits, false market information & **anything that gives an unfair advantage over others**, including using alternate accounts to artificially inflate the share price, are crimes that are subject to having your account suspended or in some instances, certain posts will be **suspended from trading**.This is heavily frowned on by the entire community as well as the moderators.\n6. Must Include Template/Example|__**If you posted a template:**__You are required to share a link to an example meme.__**If you posted a meme:**__You are required to share a link to the template.Reply to the bot's sticky comment with, for example, !template https://imgur.com/, to post your template/example. If you fail to share the relevant link in the next hour, **your post may be manually removed!**\n7. Reputable Investors Only|This is a forum for reputable investors. Your account must be **older than 7 days** and have at least **50 comment karma** to post. If your account does not meet these conditions, AutoModerator will automatically remove your post.\n8. Be Civil and Respectful|TToxic behavior towards others **is not** allowed and will be met with a ban. This behavior includes (but is not limited to) *trolling, harassing, bullying, taunting, brigading, threatening, hating, antagonizing, and bothering* other users.This doesn't mean that you should report everyone who has a **different opinion** to you, and being \"ironic\" **doesn't give you the right to say anything.**\n9. No Doxxing/Personal Information|Many Redditors prefer to keep their identity hidden and out of public view. You should always ask for consent, and should not publically leak their information on the subreddit. Posts that defame people with private lives may be subject to removal depending on how severe the mods see it.\n10. Keep NSFW/Offensive Posts To A Minimum|NSFW material or edgy material that is *excessively graphic*, *offensive*, or **that causes widespread division & controversy** is subject to removal. Memes that try to faciliate Nazi/alt-right views will be removed (e.g. StoneToss comics).Examples of NSFW posts are memes that may or may not depict sex or nudity excessively, or those that have excessive violence or gore. Examples of edgy memes are those that glorify hate such as KKK or Nazi memes, and any other bigotry.\n11.Think, Talk & Post Economically|We'd ideally like you to post original content and keep the title economics-related. This **is** a subreddit for discussing the meme economy, after all.

        "subreddit_description": "*Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It\u2019s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\u2019s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)\n\n---\n###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) \n\n#1. Videos Only\n* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.\n\n*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos\n\n#2. No Politics\n* Political videos\u2014including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)\u2014should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.\n\n* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.\n\n#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views\n\n* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts\n\n* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. \n\n* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.\n\n* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.\n\n* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.\n\n* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout\n\n#9. No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.\n](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)\n\n#10. No Self Promotion\n\n* *\"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.\"* - Confucius\n\n* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.\n\n\n---\n###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)\n\n#Removals & Warnings\n* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking).
