The original was deleted but you can find various versions of the original flooding around at this time last year.\n\n***\n\nI really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect during his last months in office. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.\n\nImagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months its the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the country. Insisting he's still the President and he never really lost the election. \n\nBut then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.\n\nNo one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no ones cares.\n\nHe's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.\n\nHis days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.\n\nHis children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.\nFree from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose \"Stockholm Syndrome\" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.\n\nThey are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.\nMelania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again\nTrump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.\n\nHe very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.\n\nBut within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.\n\nEventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.\n\nThe official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.\nThe Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.\nIn death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Some infinite presidents are recognized for the disasters they got us into like the Iraq war and the Vietnam war, but Trump managed to kill far more Americans than that by simple incompetence. A quarter of a million people died as a result of his ego, and then close to that many died the following year while the country worked to sort out the mess he left behind and get the virus under control.\n\nIn US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page in the section on politics. In fact he has mentioned far more in the discussion of disasters that hit the United States than on any sort of political achievements - because he didn\u2019t actually achieve anything, he simply failed to act based on his own arrogance. And that\u2019s all he\u2019s remembered for. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as \"tacky\".\n\nNow he is simply: \"What was the name of the President attributed to the largest preventable disaster in American history?\u201d\n\nThe answer is \"(C) Donald J. Trump\"",

However, pardoning himself or having Pence do it only pardons him for any Federal crimes he may have committed while President. It doesn't pardon any crimes from before then and it doesn't pardon State charges. Trump has dozens and dozens of State charges waiting for him in New York alone and there are a good few other states with a litany of charges too. Once he leaves office he will most likely end up in prison. This is why Trump is pulling out all the stops and is using every dirty trick he can to stay President. The truth of his situation is either stay President for the rest of his life, or die in prison.\n\nSo here's my prediction:\n\nTrump loses in a landslide, with voting numbers that in no way can be misconstrued by the Electoral College and Biden is declared the winner. Trump will automatically call the legitimacy of the result bogus but he won't have any clout left and he'll be forced to leave. Shortly after he will flee to Russia where he'll claim he fled for his life from the Deep State Democrat coup. He'll set himself up with some kind of Trump TV channel and he'll fleece his followers of their money selling them garbage products just like Alex Jones, all the while filling their heads with Putin's words to continue to cause division. Trump will be a thorn in the side of US politics from Putin's lap until he dies.\"",
