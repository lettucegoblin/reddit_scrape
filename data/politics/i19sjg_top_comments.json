It is achieved by predominantly playing to the uneducated and shallow thinking masses, and keeping them from being educated in critical thinking.\n\nUmberto Eco speaks of ur-fascism (a generic right wing dictatorship complimentary to but different than fascism). He also has fourteen characteristics of fascism in his essay Ur-Fascism and also stated **\"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it\".**\n\nhttps://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf\n\n2 problems with the DHS response in Portland:\n\n1. Anticipatory arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n2. Non-custodial arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nViolations of the 4^th and 14^th amendments.\n\nJames Waterman Wise Jr. said, in February of 1936, when fascism comes to the US \"it will probably be \u201cwrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution.\u201d\n\n3 of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here(Lawrence Britt Spring 2003 based upon the article \"The Hallmarks of Fascist Regime\" by Skip Stone):\n\n* **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n * **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  \n\n* **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**\n\n**Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.**There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\nhttps://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/two-dhs-officials-apparently-just-admitted-their-troops-have-been-violating-the-constitution/\n\n1 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Fraudulent Elections**\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. **Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.**\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/11th-circuit-florida-fines-fees-judicial-ethics.html\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Religion and Government are Intertwined**\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n* **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Corporate Power is Protected**\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n* **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n\n* Fascist Review:\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-25/portland-finally-proves-it-trump-is-pulling-us-into-fascism\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-is-donald-trump-a-fascist-1.8913249\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-fascist-performance\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-fascism-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-a9546941.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng",

He also has fourteen characteristics of fascism in his essay Ur-Fascism and also stated <strong>&quot;it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it&quot;.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf\">https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>2 problems with the DHS response in Portland:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Anticipatory arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.</p></li>\n<li><p>Non-custodial arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Violations of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> amendments.</p>\n\n<p>James Waterman Wise Jr. said, in February of 1936, when fascism comes to the US &quot;it will probably be \u201cwrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>3 of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here(Lawrence Britt Spring 2003 based upon the article &quot;The Hallmarks of Fascist Regime&quot; by Skip Stone):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of &quot;need.&quot; The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Obsession with Crime and Punishment</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.</strong>There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php\">https://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/two-dhs-officials-apparently-just-admitted-their-troops-have-been-violating-the-constitution/\">https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/two-dhs-officials-apparently-just-admitted-their-troops-have-been-violating-the-constitution/</a></p>\n\n<p>1 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraudulent Elections</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. <strong>Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/11th-circuit-florida-fines-fees-judicial-ethics.html\">https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/11th-circuit-florida-fines-fees-judicial-ethics.html</a></p>\n\n<p>2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Religion and Government are Intertwined</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government&#39;s policies or actions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\">https://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/</a></p>\n\n<p>2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Corporate Power is Protected</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rampant Cronyism and Corruption</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\">https://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fascist Review:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-25/portland-finally-proves-it-trump-is-pulling-us-into-fascism\">https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-25/portland-finally-proves-it-trump-is-pulling-us-into-fascism</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-is-donald-trump-a-fascist-1.8913249\">https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-is-donald-trump-a-fascist-1.8913249</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-fascist-performance\">https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-fascist-performance</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-fascism-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-a9546941.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-fascism-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-a9546941.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng</a></p>\n</div>",

You've effectively destroyed us as a nation.... your citizens hate you except the profoundly stupid and bigoted,  but you don't care since that's the small percent of people who you count on for votes.. you win elections through gerrymandering, external interference,  and outright fraud. I'm ashamed to be an American, these days.

You&#39;ve effectively destroyed us as a nation.... your citizens hate you except the profoundly stupid and bigoted,  but you don&#39;t care since that&#39;s the small percent of people who you count on for votes.. you win elections through gerrymandering, external interference,  and outright fraud.

Egoistic altruism: because we live in an age of innovation, other people prospering has a tendency to improve your future.\n\nThrough most of the last few thousand years, the world was (almost) a zero-sum game. Most land and resources were occupied or claimed, and (mostly) the only way to gain anything was to take it away from someone else. Nations hoarded gold and farmland, taking as much of both as they could from anyone they could.\n\nAll the while, the ongoing progress of human innovation was working in the background, slowly but accelerating. Over the last few hundred years, the pace of innovation has become so swift that the value from innovation dwarfs the value from fixed limited resources. While there are some zero-sum elements to our economy, most parts of the economy are now positive-sum. This is thanks to a unique feature of ideas: trading ideas doesn't just move them around, it *copies* them.\n\n500 years ago, virtually every person needed to work full-time in food production. Now, better farming techniques, shared around the world, have all but eliminated your need to produce food.\n\nOnce upon a time, most children died at a young age, and women dying in childbirth wasn't anywhere near as rare as today.

People who are healthy, educated, and have time to devote to developing an idea are the ones who create. Sometimes,  that can be as simple as an artist or tinkerer with enough comfort and free time to create for the love of creation. Other times, that's paid researchers and writers, working in positions made possible by a society prosperous enough to survive even with some of its members not directly producing survival goods or services.\n\nCreation happens so much faster now, largely because there are more people creating.\n\nHere is where we can tie it all back together.\n\n1. Other people prospering increases the pool of people who might create an idea, increasing the rate of creation of ideas.\n2. You benefit some from other people creating ideas.\n3. Therefore, by 1 and 2, you benefit from other people prospering.\n4. You care about you benefiting.\n5. Therefore, by 3 and 4, you should care about other people.\n\nThere is an objective and selfish reason to care about other people and fight for the downtrodden of the world: because it will protect you and get you things you want.\n\nTL;DR: [This Kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ&vl=en).",

Other times, that&#39;s paid researchers and writers, working in positions made possible by a society prosperous enough to survive even with some of its members not directly producing survival goods or services.</p>\n\n<p>Creation happens so much faster now, largely because there are more people creating.</p>\n\n<p>Here is where we can tie it all back together.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Other people prospering increases the pool of people who might create an idea, increasing the rate of creation of ideas.</li>\n<li>You benefit some from other people creating ideas.</li>\n<li>Therefore, by 1 and 2, you benefit from other people prospering.</li>\n<li>You care about you benefiting.</li>\n<li>Therefore, by 3 and 4, you should care about other people.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is an objective and selfish reason to care about other people and fight for the downtrodden of the world: because it will protect you and get you things you want.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ&amp;vl=en\">This Kurzgesagt video</a>.</p>\n</div>",
