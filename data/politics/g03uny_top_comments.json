He defeated\u00a0Jackson Miller, the Republican House Majority\u00a0Whip, to win the seat. Born in\u00a0North Carolina, Carter is a member of the\u00a0Democratic Party, an IT specialist, and a former\u00a0Marine. Carter serves on the Finance Committee and the Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee. He was endorsed by the\u00a0Democratic Socialists of America\u00a0(DSA), of which he is a member.\n\n> As a U.S. Marine, Carter served in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. His unit was also one of the first to respond to the devastating\u00a02010 earthquake\u00a0in\u00a0Haiti.\n\n...\n\n> Carter was inspired to run for office after receiving a shock while repairing a lighting system in the summer of 2015 and subsequently struggling to receive worker's compensation from Virginia while unable to work. Before choosing to run, he had long identified as \"to the left of where the Democratic party [is]\" but was further inspired by\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0to explore\u00a0democratic socialism.\n\n> Carter ran for the\u00a0Virginia House of Delegates\u00a0for the\u00a050th district. He was endorsed by the\u00a0Democratic Socialists of America\u00a0(DSA), of which he is a member.\u00a0His campaign mostly focused on issues such as\u00a0single-payer healthcare\u00a0and\u00a0financial contributions to politicians.\u00a0Jackson Miller, the incumbent Republican, distributed a mailer campaign that compared Carter to Communist rulers\u00a0Vladimir Lenin,\u00a0Joseph Stalin\u00a0and\u00a0Mao Zedong,\u00a0an act the\u00a0Democratic Party of Virginia\u00a0condemned as\u00a0fearmongering.\u00a0Miller called Carter an \"anti-jobs candidate\" and said his \"ideas are so out of the mainstream, and so incredibly expensive\".\u00a0On November 7, 2017, Carter won the race by nine percentage points.\u00a0He was one of 15 DSA members elected in 2017.\n\n...\n\n> Since taking office, Carter has been an outspoken advocate for workers' rights.\u00a0In December 2018 he introduced House Bill 1806, which would overturn Virginia's 70-year-old\u00a0right-to-work law.\u00a0Of the bill, Carter said, \"When workers form a union, everyone in the workplace benefits from higher wages and better conditions [...]\u00a0Taft\u2013Hartley\u00a0was created specifically to allow some people to stand opposed to their coworkers' union while still reaping the rewards for free.

He defeated\u00a0Jackson Miller, the Republican House Majority\u00a0Whip, to win the seat. Born in\u00a0North Carolina, Carter is a member of the\u00a0Democratic Party, an IT specialist, and a former\u00a0Marine. Carter serves on the Finance Committee and the Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee. He was endorsed by the\u00a0Democratic Socialists of America\u00a0(DSA), of which he is a member.</p>\n\n<p>As a U.S. Marine, Carter served in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
