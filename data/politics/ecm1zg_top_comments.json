I phrase it that way because some people count Nixon and some don't, since I seem to recall he resigned before the impeachment vote. Regardless, this stage of Impeachment is exceedingly rare, and a definite statement about the level of faith our countrymen and their representatives are willing to grant to the executive. It is extremely important that some permanent record be made denoting that a LARGE part of our country absolutely does not support Trump's actions and behaviour.\n\nAmerica and her people are putting up as much resistance as they can against this regime, and our CHECKS and BALANCES give us better avenues to do so than most nations before. To use a trite comparison, Nazi Germany never Impeached Hitler. This vote shows the will of at least one powerful part of those CHECKS and BALANCES against the executive standing up to it and saying \"no.\"\n\nAs a final thought, I will mention my general belief that the right thing to do is always the right thing to do. One shouldn't ONLY do the right thing because it is the move that wins; it is sufficient simply to be decisively in the right. I fully believe that our American system of governance is one of, if not THE, best in our world's history, and I am glad that at least one of our parties and the branch they control are willing to protect it strongly.",

I phrase it that way because some people count Nixon and some don&#39;t, since I seem to recall he resigned before the impeachment vote. Regardless, this stage of Impeachment is exceedingly rare, and a definite statement about the level of faith our countrymen and their representatives are willing to grant to the executive. It is extremely important that some permanent record be made denoting that a LARGE part of our country absolutely does not support Trump&#39;s actions and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>America and her people are putting up as much resistance as they can against this regime, and our CHECKS and BALANCES give us better avenues to do so than most nations before. To use a trite comparison, Nazi Germany never Impeached Hitler. This vote shows the will of at least one powerful part of those CHECKS and BALANCES against the executive standing up to it and saying &quot;no.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As a final thought, I will mention my general belief that the right thing to do is always the right thing to do. One shouldn&#39;t ONLY do the right thing because it is the move that wins; it is sufficient simply to be decisively in the right. I fully believe that our American system of governance is one of, if not THE, best in our world&#39;s history, and I am glad that at least one of our parties and the branch they control are willing to protect it strongly.</p>\n</div>",

And he obstructed Congress by refusing to produce any witnesses or documents\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 2: No harm occurred because the military aid went through. \n\nResponse: The aid went through only after Trump was caught. In the meantime, months of delay cost Ukraine lives in its war with Russia. US credibility was harmed and moral authority to fight corruption was eroded.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 3: Because aid went through, no misconduct was committed.\n\nResponse: Bribery occurs upon demand for a personal favor in exchange for performance of an official act. If you offer a cop $20 to get out of a traffic ticket, even if he declines, you have still committed bribery\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 4: Abuse of power is not even a crime. \n\nResponse: Impeachable conduct may be criminal conduct, but need not be. A president could be impeached if he watched TV all day and failed to fulfill his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 5: There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for an investigation. \n\nResponse: If this were legitimate investigation, you wouldn\u2019t need to send your personal lawyer and his henchmen to do it. Witnesses say Trump didn\u2019t want investigation, just announcement of investigation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 6: There was no quid pro quo. \n\n[Response:] Read the transcript! Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cfavor\u201d is strong evidence, corroborated by witness testimony, of months-long scheme to get Zelensky to \u201cgo to the mic\u201d and announce Biden probe. Aid was leverage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 7: As VP, Biden held up aid as leverage to get rid of the Ukrainian public prosecutor. \n\nResponse: It is appropriate for a president or VP to take action to advance the interests of the nation. Trump was advancing his personal interests.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 8: Testimony is hearsay.\n\nResponse: Rules of Evidence don\u2019t apply. Also, call summary, Sondland testimony are non-hearsay. Trump has barred direct witnesses. You can\u2019t have it both ways. If they had information favorable to Trump, you can bet we would have heard from them.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 9: It happens all the time. Get over it. \n\nResponse: Trump sought foreign influence in our election and harmed national security by delaying aid designed to fight Russia, our adversary. We don\u2019t have to accept it. We deserve better.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 10: Impeachment would un-do an election. \n\nResponse: All impeachments un-do elections. Constitution permits impeachment if president is unfit to serve. When rigging an election is involved, elections are ineffective for removal. Impeachment is not to punish but to protect.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 11: Impeachment proceedings are moving too fast. \n\nResponse: This impeachment has moved slower than Bill Clinton\u2019s and on pace with Richard Nixon\u2019s. For a president who presents a clear and present danger to national security, removal is urgent and can\u2019t come soon enough\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 12: We need to hear from the whistleblower. \n\nResponse: The whistleblower was a tipster, whose tip led to the investigation. Tipsters do not testify at trial, the witnesses do. We have a duty to protect whistleblowers to encourage them to use proper channels to report abuse\"",
