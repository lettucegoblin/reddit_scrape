Its holiday season you need at least 20 hours a week.\n\nMe: Im here to pay my bills. My commission pays my bills. The hourly rate (7.15$) is nothing compared to the commission check. I functionally get paid once a month. Which part of my mortgage takes \"team numbers\"?\n\nThem: Wow your gunna be like that about it?\n\nMe: Yeah im here to pay my bills. My bills are paid. Almost exclusively by the commission check. I dont want to be here. Im going home now.\n\n------\n\nThem: Hey we noticed your not attending any of the team building meetings. We are trying to being everyone together and make a better work environment.\n\nMe: Im here to pay my bills. I show up, punch in, be as miserable and not wanting to be here as much as anyone else, and go home when my shift is over.  A 20 minute off the phone lunch party isnt gunna make me want to be here any more. Id rather get a few calls in and make my commission larger.\n\nThem: Thats not really a team building attitude your never gunna move up if thats how you act.\n\nMe: I would take a huge paycut to move up.

We need your help now.\n\nMe: Im not going to risk losing a sale thats going to make me 90-130 dollars per line bothering people over an accessory thats going to make me literally 2 bucks.
