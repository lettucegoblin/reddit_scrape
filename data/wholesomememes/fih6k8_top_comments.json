        "body": "Was at a night club in PCAN, Fla during my younger Navy days. This hottie just started staring at me. I thought it was a sure sign of a good time. I went over and told her my name. She asked again and I told her thinking she didn\u2019t hear me because of the music. She repeated my name back and I said yes and she just broke down crying loudly and hugging me hardcore. \n\nHer friends started separating us and pushing me away like I had hurt her. One of her friends was even up in my face asking me what I did to her. As she was yelling at me she stops and just starts saying I look like Mando (I hadn\u2019t told her my name). Me being confused I told her I was Mando. She was confused as I. A couple of seconds later everyone comes back over to me including the original girl I had approached. They ask my name and where I was from. They all just stood there in disbelief. \n\nApparently I looked just like and had the same name as the husband of the girl I approached. Her husband had died just over 6 months and from what they said it was honestly the first time she had left her house and was trying to get over being depressed. We talked a for a bit, they were curious if her husband and I were related. She did a lot of crying as did some of her friends. She showed me pictures from her wallet and I was amazed, I looked just like her husband. \n\nI told her I needed to go back to my ship.

I went over and told her my name. She asked again and I told her thinking she didn\u2019t hear me because of the music. She repeated my name back and I said yes and she just broke down crying loudly and hugging me hardcore. </p>\n\n<p>Her friends started separating us and pushing me away like I had hurt her. One of her friends was even up in my face asking me what I did to her. As she was yelling at me she stops and just starts saying I look like Mando (I hadn\u2019t told her my name). Me being confused I told her I was Mando. She was confused as I. A couple of seconds later everyone comes back over to me including the original girl I had approached. They ask my name and where I was from. They all just stood there in disbelief. </p>\n\n<p>Apparently I looked just like and had the same name as the husband of the girl I approached. Her husband had died just over 6 months and from what they said it was honestly the first time she had left her house and was trying to get over being depressed.

I could see him about a half mile away, riding dead center in my lane right at me. It was my uncle John I have no doubt.\nMy dad was with me and he saw what I saw.\nIt was the same build, the same kinda jacket, the same beanie, and the same cool laid back attitude that always poured out of my uncle. At about 10 car lengths he just gently leaned out of my lane and cruised by. Never to be seen again. This highway is the only way in and the only way out unless you have a helicopter or a nice lifted 4x4. I saw that guy go in, in the direction the highway ends at a lake, no way through or around, and waited and waited and waited for him to come back out before I returned home, and he never did.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve never seen that guy or that bike again.</p>\n</div>",
