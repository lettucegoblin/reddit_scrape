But as the sun started going down, I see my friends and acquaintances turn up, my sister's friend turn up, our family friend's kids and slowly almost all the kids from the neighborhood turn to my surprise. They all cheered me up, brought gifts for me and made me feel like a celebrity. I cut the cake, we all blew balloons, had dinner together, played musical chair, antakshari and many more games. I didn't even know half of them before that evening. My dad bought this huge paper sheets, stick them together across the wall, gave every kid a box of crayon and asked them to write, draw anything they want on it. My dad also made sure to have a photographer and videographer to record everything. Next day, when I saw the sheets there was only few drawing and most of the sheet was covered with messages wishing me happy birthday, how good they felt coming and some even sketching me as their buddy. I felt so special and made some life long friends from that day. Few years later, this gentleman also made sure to covert that video cassette into digital format so that when I grow up, I could revive those memories and take some important lessons of life from it.",

It wasn\u2019t going to be this huge party but it was my first time hosting so I wanted to go all out. Come Friday and Saturday, people were canceling left and right. They had good reasons though, and I wasn\u2019t angry. Some had track practice, one had his grandma from Florida come that weekend so he couldn\u2019t come over, there was a birthday party that weekend for someone so like 4 people couldn\u2019t come.\n\nOnly 3 people ended up coming out of the 15 I invited. And guess what? I still had fun. We ate enchiladas, ate Oreos and had chocolate chip cookies, tuna with crackers, Domino\u2019s pizza too. We played Wii Sports, MarioKart Wii, we watched Bird Box and watched The Office. The last person left at 9:30 but I was just happy people came and had a good time.\n\nBut yeah.

I told all of them 3 weeks in advance and to advise me when there were any changes. I was hosting it on a Saturday and the Wednesday before, I went to Costco and ShopRite with my mom to buy sodas, deserts, chips, everything. It wasn\u2019t going to be this huge party but it was my first time hosting so I wanted to go all out. Come Friday and Saturday, people were canceling left and right. They had good reasons though, and I wasn\u2019t angry. Some had track practice, one had his grandma from Florida come that weekend so he couldn\u2019t come over, there was a birthday party that weekend for someone so like 4 people couldn\u2019t come.</p>\n\n<p>Only 3 people ended up coming out of the 15 I invited. And guess what? I still had fun. We ate enchiladas, ate Oreos and had chocolate chip cookies, tuna with crackers, Domino\u2019s pizza too. We played Wii Sports, MarioKart Wii, we watched Bird Box and watched The Office. The last person left at 9:30 but I was just happy people came and had a good time.</p>\n\n<p>But yeah. People shouldn\u2019t be assholes. Just wanted to share my story!</p>\n</div>",

Luckily the few kids that did show up had a great time, but it still makes me sad thinking about that. It wasn't until I was quite a bit older I asked my Mum one day why people were always so mean to this family, and she told me it was because his mother was a white British woman and his Dad was a Pakistani.

My family wasn't rich and they weren't going to pay for every kid, so I could only invite 7, plus it would be more manageable to have that many young teens over for the night.\n\nI remember asking them not to talk about it at school, but word got out and the other boys quickly found out who was going and who wasn't.

It\u2019s not always that the child is being a jerk; sometimes they simply don\u2019t know any better. But it\u2019s up to the parent to teach them and a lot of people simply forget to treat their child like a person who needs to learn. \n\nAll people have an innate selfishness that can easily turn you into a terrible person if it\u2019s not curved. It\u2019s something we see in babies/toddlers all the time. \u201cThe Terrible Two\u2019s\u201d is a well known thing. Parents know and brace themselves to land right in the middle of Tantrum Central. And it all stems from babies learning trends and trying to use it to their selfish advantage.

I was in my first year at a private school, and my parents don\u2019t give a fuck about flaunting wealth so naturally I was ostracized. I remember this smug ass look on her face that was quickly wiped off when I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like playing horses all day anyways.\u201d Michaela, you horse loving weirdo, I was happy as a kid to not be included in your strange horse play at recess all of third grade. Galloping around on your hands and knees and neighing and shit. Funny enough, that exchange helped me find other kids who also thought being bossed Around into \u201chorses\u201d was stupid.

He was a gipsy and he didn\u2019t have the best parents so he didn\u2019t really have a choice. \n\nMost kids wouldn\u2019t treat him poorly in the slightest but they knew he was different and sometimes they/we cracked stupid jokes when he wasn\u2019t around, the girls were mean to him tho which sucked.\n\n\nMy mom knew about his parents neglecting him and not treating him well, so every year she made sure he had a cake for his birthday date (same as mine actually, June 6th) and some sort of present. That made me really happy, my mom didn\u2019t need to do anything for him but she chose to do it anyway, I hope I can do the same and I hope my kids treats everyone with respect no matter what gender, race, background, etc.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s 20 now, I met him last year on the boat to Lisbon and he recognized me instantly even tho we hadn\u2019t seen each other in so many years. He said hi, asked me how I was doing and thanked me and my mom for everything...that really hit me in the feels because that was the first sentence out of his mouth when he saw me, I\u2019m guessing it was really important to him.\n\nApparently he sells drugs now which fucking sucks but he\u2019s happy, already has a wife and a kid, a huge group of friends from what I can see, and a pretty good place to live. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s doing okay even if he\u2019s doing something I don\u2019t consider right nor is it....well...,legal, I\u2019m hoping he gets a real job in the future and things work out just as fine\n",
