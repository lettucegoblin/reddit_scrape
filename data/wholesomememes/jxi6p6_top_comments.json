My friend really took a liking to these kids, and it\u2019s very difficult to find somebody that wants to adopt 4 siblings at once, so she adopted them. </p>\n\n<p>A couple years later, the mom had done everything right. She cleaned up her life, sought counseling, got her GED, got a reliable job, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know the details, but the mom got in touch and now she is a big part of the kids\u2019 life again. My friend is still the legal mother because that\u2019s what they decided was best, but they somehow all have a healthy relationship.</p>\n</div>",
