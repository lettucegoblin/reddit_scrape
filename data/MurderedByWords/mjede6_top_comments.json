A couple of us would try to use the extra we had to pool together for his lunch because he wouldn't get any otherwise.  The lunch lady wouldn't let us.  So we would all get extra something and pay for it and give it to him.  Got caught one day and the lunch lady took all of our food away and sent us to the principals office.  He tried to justify it by saying the lunch lady had no way of knowing the kid hadn't bullied us into giving him food and that it wasn't safe to share food (like we would have screwed with it to give him something that would make him sick).  Almost got detention over that. Instead we promised never to do it again.  From then on at the start of the week we would all put whatever change we had in his cubby or the kids who brought lunch would stick whatever they were willing to give up as well (anything from granola bars, carrots, raisins... not always the yummiest for a kid but he always took it and ate it).
