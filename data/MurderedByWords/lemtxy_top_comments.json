If someone without a home isn\u2019t part of that system, it\u2019s possible they were too violent or unstable for the shelter staff to handle. We have to remember this is a population with a high incidence of severe mental illness. There\u2019s a lot of incontinence, drug use, violence, and other bad things going on among a lot of these people. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nyc-residents-want-homeless-moved-out-of-hotels-fear-their-safety-is-compromised/2556242/%3famp\">And these can jeopardize the safety of others.</a>. These people need our help, but we have to be clear-eyed about the challenges.</p>\n</div>",
