The WHO estimates around 760 million people have been infected by COVID-19. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nWhat these people dont understand about the disease, is the fact these numbers dont mean you can go around licking doorknobs because 1.2 million people is NOT a small number and downplaying this disease because \"JUST\" 1.2 MILLION people died is the most disgusting, egotistical, self centered shit ever in the existance of anything.\n\nThink of it like this, if you are in war than that is your reality, you live and you survive... or you don't.

Many states even offer same day registration.\n\nIn this moment, it falls to people \u2014 even those who prefer a Republican president \u2014 to preserve, protect and defend the United States by voting.\n\n[Here is a map](https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/) that shows how and when you can **vote in your state.** Please vote now.\n\n**Some of the reasons why donald trump is not fit to lead this country:**\n\n* He has repeatedly violated his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n* He has shown a breathtaking disregard for the lives and liberties of Americans.\n* **His administration is rampantly corrupt.**\n* **He celebrates violence.**\n* **He divides and attacks Americans every single day.**\n* **He has been grossly negligent with the public's health.**\n* **He is incompetent in all international matters.**\n* **He campaigned as a champion of ordinary workers, but he has governed on behalf of the wealthy.**\n* **He's historically failed at doing any good in the matters of climate, immigration, women's rights and social justice reforms.**\n* He's demonstrated consistently that he's [racist](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/opinion/trump-nazism-republican-party-failing.html) and [xenophobic](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/opinion/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html).\n* He's damaged [NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/opinion/editorials/why-nato-matters.html) and [lowered our standing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/nato-trump.html) in the world, a position many Americans have fought and died to secure.\n* He's [abused his power and obstructed justice](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/14/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment.html) \\- any other president in American history would have been removed for the smallest offense on his list.\n* When the House impeached donald trump, a complicit senate [refused to convict](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/opinion/trump-impeachment-vote.html) and remove him to protect themselves.\n* Four more years of trump in office seriously threatens the chance that American democracy, an almost 250 year old idea that we've worked towards, survives.\n* he has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\n* If he doesn't win, he'll work to confuse the election results and leave the decision up to a\u00a0 supreme court unlawfully packed with conservative justices, some credibly accused of sexual assault and one potentially coming that his hostile towards the established rights of women and LGBTQ+ people.\n* **He's a failed showman forever boasting about things he has never done, wealth he doesn't have and promising to do things he will never do.**\n* He has sought to persuade both Congress and the courts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act without proposing any substitute policy to provide Americans with access to affordable health care.\n* During the first three years of his administration, the number of Americans without health insurance [increased](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html) by 2.3 million.\n* He promised an increase in the federal minimum wage and fresh investment in infrastructure; he delivered a round of tax cuts that mostly benefited rich people.\n* He has indiscriminately erased regulations, and answered the prayers of corporations by suspending enforcement of rules he could not easily erase.\n* **Under his leadership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has stopped trying to protect consumers and the Environmental Protection Agency has stopped trying to protect the environment.**\n* He walked away from the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html). In its place, trump has conducted a trade war, imposing billions in tariffs \u2014 taxes that are actually paid by Americans \u2014 without any concessions from China.\n* **Mr. Trump has treated the COVID-19 global pandemic as a public relations problem instead of working to save American lives.**\n* He lied about the danger of the coronavirus, challenged the expertzs and resisted proactive precautions; now he's trying to force the economy open without bringing the virus under control.\n* As the economy collapsed, he signed an initial round of aid and when the stock market rebounded, even though millions remained out of work, Mr. Trump lost interest.\n* **In September, he declared that the virus \u201caffects virtually nobody\u201d the day before the death toll from the disease in the United States topped 200,000. Nine days later, he caught the virus and received $100,000 in taxpayer funded health care to fight the virus that he did nothing to avoid contracting.**\n* He has pitted Americans against each other, weaponizing Twitter and Facebook to manipulate supporters around a virtual bonfire of grievances to flood the public square with lies, disinformation and propaganda.\n* **At the first presidential debate in September, trump was asked to condemn white supremacists.

Many states even offer same day registration.</p>\n\n<p>In this moment, it falls to people \u2014 even those who prefer a Republican president \u2014 to preserve, protect and defend the United States by voting.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rockthevote.org/how-to-vote/\">Here is a map</a> that shows how and when you can <strong>vote in your state.</strong> Please vote now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of the reasons why donald trump is not fit to lead this country:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He has repeatedly violated his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.</li>\n<li>He has shown a breathtaking disregard for the lives and liberties of Americans.</li>\n<li><strong>His administration is rampantly corrupt.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He celebrates violence.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He divides and attacks Americans every single day.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He has been grossly negligent with the public&#39;s health.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He is incompetent in all international matters.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He campaigned as a champion of ordinary workers, but he has governed on behalf of the wealthy.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>He&#39;s historically failed at doing any good in the matters of climate, immigration, women&#39;s rights and social justice reforms.</strong></li>\n<li>He&#39;s demonstrated consistently that he&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/opinion/trump-nazism-republican-party-failing.html\">racist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/opinion/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html\">xenophobic</a>.</li>\n<li>He&#39;s damaged <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/opinion/editorials/why-nato-matters.html\">NATO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/nato-trump.html\">lowered our standing</a> in the world, a position many Americans have fought and died to secure.</li>\n<li>He&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/14/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment.html\">abused his power and obstructed justice</a> - any other president in American history would have been removed for the smallest offense on his list.</li>\n<li>When the House impeached donald trump, a complicit senate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/opinion/trump-impeachment-vote.html\">refused to convict</a> and remove him to protect themselves.</li>\n<li>Four more years of trump in office seriously threatens the chance that American democracy, an almost 250 year old idea that we&#39;ve worked towards, survives.</li>\n<li>he has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.</li>\n<li>If he doesn&#39;t win, he&#39;ll work to confuse the election results and leave the decision up to a\u00a0 supreme court unlawfully packed with conservative justices, some credibly accused of sexual assault and one potentially coming that his hostile towards the established rights of women and LGBTQ+ people.</li>\n<li><strong>He&#39;s a failed showman forever boasting about things he has never done, wealth he doesn&#39;t have and promising to do things he will never do.</strong></li>\n<li>He has sought to persuade both Congress and the courts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act without proposing any substitute policy to provide Americans with access to affordable health care.</li>\n<li>During the first three years of his administration, the number of Americans without health insurance <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html\">increased</a> by 2.3 million.</li>\n<li>He promised an increase in the federal minimum wage and fresh investment in infrastructure; he delivered a round of tax cuts that mostly benefited rich people.</li>\n<li>He has indiscriminately erased regulations, and answered the prayers of corporations by suspending enforcement of rules he could not easily erase.</li>\n<li><strong>Under his leadership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has stopped trying to protect consumers and the Environmental Protection Agency has stopped trying to protect the environment.</strong></li>\n<li>He walked away from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>. In its place, trump has conducted a trade war, imposing billions in tariffs \u2014 taxes that are actually paid by Americans \u2014 without any concessions from China.</li>\n<li><strong>Mr. Trump has treated the COVID-19 global pandemic as a public relations problem instead of working to save American lives.</strong></li>\n<li>He lied about the danger of the coronavirus, challenged the expertzs and resisted proactive precautions; now he&#39;s trying to force the economy open without bringing the virus under control.</li>\n<li>As the economy collapsed, he signed an initial round of aid and when the stock market rebounded, even though millions remained out of work, Mr. Trump lost interest.</li>\n<li><strong>In September, he declared that the virus \u201caffects virtually nobody\u201d the day before the death toll from the disease in the United States topped 200,000. Nine days later, he caught the virus and received $100,000 in taxpayer funded health care to fight the virus that he did nothing to avoid contracting.</strong></li>\n<li>He has pitted Americans against each other, weaponizing Twitter and Facebook to manipulate supporters around a virtual bonfire of grievances to flood the public square with lies, disinformation and propaganda.</li>\n<li><strong>At the first presidential debate in September, trump was asked to condemn white supremacists. He responded by instructing the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d</strong></li>\n<li>In June, his administration tear-gassed peaceful protesters from a street in front of the White House so trump could pose with a book he does not read in front of a church he does not attend.</li>\n<li>trump has repeatedly directed administration officials not to testify before Congress or provide documents, notably including his tax returns.</li>\n<li><strong>With the help of AG william barr, he&#39;s shielded loyal aides (convicted criminals) from justice.</strong></li>\n<li>In May, the Justice Department said it would drop the prosecution of michael flynn even though flynn had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/michael-flynn-charges-dropped.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to lying to the F.B.I.</li>\n<li>In July, trump commuted sentence of former aide, roger stone, who was convicted of obstructing a federal investigation of trump.

I've never personally met anyone  who has had COVID-19, at least that they were aware of. So far as I know, I've never met anyone who knows someone who has had COVID-19, let alone with serious symptoms.\n\n\nNow I believe the disease exists and is approximately as described, but at what point would I start to doubt it? We have close to .1% of Americans who have died from the disease, and close to 3% who have been recorded as contracting it. Since I know a couple hundred people, I would expect a half-dozen to have contracted it - but then again, my knowledge is incomplete, my group of acquaintances have similar qualities, and I could have missed someone easily enough. But eventually I would have to become suspicious - like if instead of 9 million cases in America, there were 100 million, a little more than a third of the population, but I never met anyone with COVID. Or 200 million - about two-thirds the population, but no one I knew has had it. At a certain point I would have to start doubting that these numbers could possibly be accurate. \n\n\nSo even I have a threshold for when I would start to doubt even the story of major organizations responsible for this sort of thing. I assume everyone does, which is why there is so much doubt around the official numbers from China. If China reported similar numbers to the US, people might believe them, but at a certain point they are just too low to be plausible. For some people in the US, their threshold to disbelieve the  government/news/NGOs is fairly low, so if they can't confirm it for themselves, they reject it.
