        "body": "Actually, it isn't, because the utilities / government have done such a terrible job of maintaining the system.  Our power grid is based on a couple of fundamental points.  \n\nOne is, demand fluctuates a lot, but centralized production of electricity is far more efficient.  If you're using coal or nuclear plants or hydroelectric dams, this is totally true.  One giant coal-fired plant is far more efficient than ten small ones.  But giant turbines don't want to spin up and spin down.  They want to run at a constant capacity.  \n\nWhich is problematic because of the fluctuation in demand.  At 3 AM or noon, power usage levels average out much lower than at 8 PM.  *Peak hours* -- in the 70s and 80s, there were *Stop Peaking!* slogans passed off as environmentalism.  The real problem is ramping giant power stations up and down.  It destroys the efficiency.\n\nHowever!  Alternating current plus really high voltage makes it practical to 'ship' electricity long distances.  This is why we have high-tension power lines that cross the country.  Peak demand hours in California are very different from peak demand hours in Boston.  So Boston plants can run at full power even after Bostonians have gone to bed, if they can ship the extra power to California.  (This is an oversimplification.)\n\nBut that means a gargantuan power grid that needs billions in maintenance.  And as populations increase, you gotta keep upgrading that grid.  As plants close and new ones open, it's a big deal.\n\nWind and solar make distributed power generation plausible, which means fewer issues with shipping power around, never mind the environmental benefits of not burning coal.  (Coal smog particulates in the air might be the #1 cause of premature death / lower life expectancy in the US, in fact, all in all.)  But giant power companies want all generation to stay concentrated in hardware too expensive for private ownership, which is about 50% of why we use gigantic wind turbines and not very many smaller ones.\n\nWe're at the point now where no one knows how to pay for repairing and upgrading the distribution grid.  Maybe if we cancelled half our military aircraft projects, ha ha.  But if localized *storage* (buffering) were in every neighborhood, or even a third of them, it'd mean power could be transmitted on the grid at a much more constant rate, producing less stress and less peak voltage.\n\nIt'd also remove the storage issues for private home-owned solar and wind.  Just feed the capacitance.\n\n*That's* what utilities should do.  And if Musk were as smart as he thinks, he'd be pushing that, since he'd make untold billions supplying industrial batteries.  Instead, if it happens, someone else will probably produce them, at some equally obscene cost.  But it'd still be cheaper.\n\n(Hopefully, carbon batteries, or something, and not lithium, etc.)\n\n/not my TED Talk",

My wife &amp; I took our Model S out one evening, parked at a local park, and hung out in the back with the seats down.  We&#39;re both 6&#39; or so, and we fit great.  Had a blanket &amp; pillow each, and could easily have spent a very comfortable night there.  More comfortable than a tent, waterproof, temp controlled, no bugs, and smooth jazz to read to.  Fun times.  :-)</p>\n</div>",
