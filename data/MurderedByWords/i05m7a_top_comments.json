That which you call Ee&#39;d Plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful, but for all the people! Down the centuries, you have slurred the meaning of the words, &#39;We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.&#39; These words and the words that follow were not written only for the Yangs, but for the Kohms as well!</p>\n\n<p><strong>KIRK:</strong> They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing! Do you understand?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGO-SldLrNA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGO-SldLrNA</a></p>\n</div>",
