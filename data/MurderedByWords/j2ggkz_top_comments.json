This means that for most citizens, you were either assigned Team Red or Team Blue by your parents and your goal is to help your team win, NOT to try and pick the best candidate.

They themselves would benefit most from additional social services or improvements to said services, but they consistently vote against them. Why? As said, it's all Red Team vs. Blue Team and the media sure as fuck isn't discouraging this attitude. The media basically present things like \"and here's Blue Team captain to tell us which stance you should have, and after that we'll hear from Red team captain. Tune in at 11 to hear this network's personal bias as we criticize the opposing team harshly.\"\n\nI also find a bitter irony in the fact that for example, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania get shamed for flipping when they usually don't. The atmosphere is that they get labeled idiots and traitors....personally? I'm glad to see there's enough people there putting actual thought into their vote that the vote *can* flip.
