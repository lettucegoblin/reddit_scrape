Also because most of our foods are dominated by garbage fillers that are basically just saw dust, cornmeal, salt and sugar.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Getting Americans to give that up is going to be brutally difficult, almost impossible (cause freedom, or whatever). In the likely event that you fail at changing the actual diet of the nation, you\u2019d be pressed with the issue of having to raise taxes on fatty gross foods because people consuming them in disgusting quantities are becoming a burden on the tax payer who\u2019s now funding their medicine. This also isn\u2019t gonna fly well with typical American ideology because people want to feel free to engorge themselves without paying a premium. \n\nHonestly, if we just ditched insurance entirely and had transparent pricing (if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about you actually have no idea how fucking wild healthcare is here), the free market would drive prices down through competitive practice and dictate reasonably affordable medical care. \n\nI don\u2019t even know why I bother though because none of those things will happen here.

They make bad choices that wind up using more than their fair share of healthcare.\n\nNot really. \n\nIn the US there are 106.4 million people that are overweight, at an additional lifetime healthcare cost of $3,770 per person average. 98.2 million obese at an average additional lifetime cost of $17,795. 25.2 million morbidly obese, at an average additional lifetime cost of $22,619. With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. \n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290\n\nWe're spending 165% more than the OECD average on healthcare--that works out to over half a million dollars per person more over a lifetime of care--and you're worried about 0.99%?\n\nHere's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. \n\n>Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.\n\nhttps://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF\n\nFor further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. \n\nhttps://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf",

Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF\">https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF</a></p>\n\n<p>For further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf\">https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf</a></p>\n</div>",

People also don't realize they're paying for other people's insurance through higher costs--it's not like businesses eat the cost of providing insurance for their employees. \n\nFinally, they don't realize that due to the massive inefficiency of US healthcare, Americans are paying more in taxes towards healthcare than anywhere else on earth.\n\nWith government in the US covering [64.3% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ([$11,072 as of 2019](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf)) that's $7,119 per person per year in taxes towards health care.

        "body": "Wow.. I just.. Can't... Wow. Your system is so fucked up.... Unbelievable. Here in germany its like this: every citizen has insurance by one of many companies. If you are working, a certain percentage of your wage goes to the insurance company. This will be matched by your employer (e.g. If the percentage is 5 % and your net wage would be 100\u20ac, your employer would essentially pay 105\u20ac: 95 to you and 10 to the insurance company.) if you get sick, you go to the doctor, free of charge. The one or more of the following will happen: 1.you get a doctor's note that you don't have to work for x days 2. Your doctor will send you to a specialist for your sickness and/or 3. They will prescribe you something to help you, like pills, creams, a wheelchair, whatever. \nDepending on your insurance company, certain treatments will be paid in full or in part, but basic stuff will be covered by all of them. Bigger things, like cancer treatment or surgery after an accident will be paid if deemed medically necessary, by a panel of doctors employed by the company. On sick days your employer is required by law to pay your full  wages for up to 6 weeks for the same sickness. After that time the insurance company will pay you ~60% of your wage for up to 18 month within a 3 year period for all your sicknesses. Any prescribed drugs which are necessary and prescription only have a sort of copay: 10% of the cost, at least 5\u20ac and at most 10\u20ac. If it costs less then 5\u20ac, you pay in full.  Some things have a higher copay, vor example : my wife has a bunion on her left foot. Her doctor prescribed her special orthopedic shoe inserts which cost her 30\u20ac. But since they were tailored to her feet, I'm sure they cost a lot more. My father had cancer, and we even got a hospital style bed at home. I'm not sure if we paid anything for it, but if we did it wasn't much, not nearly as much as it would have been without insurance.\n\nDisclaimer : all of the information is to be taken with a grain of salt, its quite simplified and i don't really know the finer points. What i do know is that I have depression and I go once every 3 months to my psychiatrist to get my prescription for 2 meds, annd pay 10\u20ac for 180 pills on total( every day, one in the morning and one in the evening, for 3 months) nothing for the doctor's visit. The birth of my daughter cost me exactly 0\u20ac, including epidural and 1 week of hospital stay.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow.. I just.. Can&#39;t... Wow. Your system is so fucked up.... Unbelievable. Here in germany its like this: every citizen has insurance by one of many companies. If you are working, a certain percentage of your wage goes to the insurance company. This will be matched by your employer (e.g. If the percentage is 5 % and your net wage would be 100\u20ac, your employer would essentially pay 105\u20ac: 95 to you and 10 to the insurance company.) if you get sick, you go to the doctor, free of charge. The one or more of the following will happen: 1.you get a doctor&#39;s note that you don&#39;t have to work for x days 2. Your doctor will send you to a specialist for your sickness and/or 3. They will prescribe you something to help you, like pills, creams, a wheelchair, whatever. \nDepending on your insurance company, certain treatments will be paid in full or in part, but basic stuff will be covered by all of them. Bigger things, like cancer treatment or surgery after an accident will be paid if deemed medically necessary, by a panel of doctors employed by the company. On sick days your employer is required by law to pay your full  wages for up to 6 weeks for the same sickness. After that time the insurance company will pay you ~60% of your wage for up to 18 month within a 3 year period for all your sicknesses. Any prescribed drugs which are necessary and prescription only have a sort of copay: 10% of the cost, at least 5\u20ac and at most 10\u20ac. If it costs less then 5\u20ac, you pay in full.  Some things have a higher copay, vor example : my wife has a bunion on her left foot. Her doctor prescribed her special orthopedic shoe inserts which cost her 30\u20ac. But since they were tailored to her feet, I&#39;m sure they cost a lot more. My father had cancer, and we even got a hospital style bed at home. I&#39;m not sure if we paid anything for it, but if we did it wasn&#39;t much, not nearly as much as it would have been without insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer : all of the information is to be taken with a grain of salt, its quite simplified and i don&#39;t really know the finer points.
