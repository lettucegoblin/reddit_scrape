My Gen X and millennial cousins, in both red and blue states, are still proudly proclaiming liberalism is a mental disorder, throwing fits over bathroom bills, proclaiming their right to bear arms, defending the unborn (much more than the already born), refusing to wear a mask, and proudly mocking anyone on the left as sheep. You can\u2019t reason with someone who refuses to listen to reason. Facts are only facts to them when it supports their beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>My Gen Z daughter is frustrated by people her age who say homophobic and xenophobic things. It seems to be an issue of \u201cothering\u201d people. Us vs Them. You either check all the boxes on their list of what they feel is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cright\u201d or \u201cone of us\u201d or you don\u2019t, in which case you\u2019re an undeserving insult-du-jour. With extra helpings of pure glee.</p>\n</div>",
