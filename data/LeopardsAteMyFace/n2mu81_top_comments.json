Genuine question, because I'm on the fence with how I think reproductive rights should be carried out, would you differentiate banning abortions, and forcing all women over 50 to get their tubes tied (as in, would you view one as more of a violation of your rights than the other)?

So they try to convince women by saying \"no you don't ACTUALLY want an abortion\", and treat women as if they don't know what they really want and don't know what's best for themselves. \n\nIt's very very sexist because it strengthens this belief that women should not be trusted to make important medical decisions regarding their own body because, apparently, they don't know what they actually want and are so misinformed on the effects of pregnancy and/or abortion. \n\nI think it's best to allow a woman to decide for herself what will impact her the most. Is she uncomfortable with having an abortion because she will feel guilty about it? She should not have an abortion then. Is she uncomfortable with the idea of giving birth and her body enduring what pregnancy does to it? She should not have to gestate and give birth.

        "body": ">I mention that abortions have emotional and physical fallout and you claim I am in fantasizing women and sexiest to boot\n\nNo, I claim that it's up to the woman to decide for herself what will impact her the most. Abortion is not easy for many women, either, but it's up to them to decide if they'd rather have an abortion or if they'd rather gestate and give birth. If a woman is uncomfortable with getting an abortion because she will be emotionally traumatized by it, she should NOT get an abortion. If a woman is uncomfortable with gestating and giving birth, she should NOT do so, then. No one here is claiming abortion is some sort of walk in the park; it's only you accusing me of doing so. **What I am saying is that a woman should decide for herself what will impact her physical and emotional health the most, whether that is to have an abortion, or to gestate and give birth. What you say is that we remove one of these options (abortion), and force women to take the other option (gestation and childbirth), because you believe abortion is wrong and that any and every woman who had one or will plan to have one will experience nothing but shame, regret, guilt, pain, while also not considering at all how a woman's emotional/physical health will be impacted when she is forced to gestate and give birth against her will.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We can financially punish a man for having sex with a woman but we can\u2019t make him have the baby. \n\nWhich was the point of this fake bill. How would people react if we advocate that the bodies of men be violated for the sake of having or not having children? How would people react if we claim that men should undergo certain processes/procedures so that they don't go around impregnating women and causing any unwanted pregnancies? Judging from your reaction, you believe the bodies of men should not be violated at all, but the bodies of women should be. \n\n>The choices women have now lessen the differences considerable but instead of being grateful most women lament the financial cost or the supreme difficulties of taking a pill once a day. \n\nWhat exactly are you claiming here? That women these days are unappreciative for what modern medicine has done for them?\n\n>At the end of it all women are the ones that need to be responsible (as individuals) for themselves.\n\nOnce again, you are forgetting the fact that this is the entire reason why birth control and abortion exists: so that the sexual lives of men and women are as equal as possible. Women are the ones who can get pregnant, not men, so what's one of the purposes of birth control? To ensure the woman won't get pregnant \\[by greatly reducing the chances of pregnancy\\], so that women can lead sexually active lifestyles without being held back by their biology, so that women and men can be as equal as possible. The option of abortion allows women to have total control of their own lives, career, education, bodies, without being held back by their own reproductive system. \n\nYour claim that women should be more responsible because they can get pregnant tells me that you believe men can be less responsible since they can't get pregnant. Essentially, you believe men can go around having as much sex as they want, impregnating as many women as they want, and can ESPECIALLY do so if they have the financial means necessary to pay any amount of child support. However, women must carefully restrict their lifestyles to avoid getting pregnant. Am I correct on claiming this is what you believe?\n\n>But none of any of these statements changes the fact that an unborn child is a human life that is given no rights and is considered disposable, but only if the woman doesn\u2019t want it.\n\nLet's say this: We've established that both the fetus and pregnant person have a set of basic human rights, since they're both human. Now, it's impossible to claim to care about both the pregnant person AND fetus equally in the case of abortion. You cannot save the fetus  and its life without advocating that the pregnant person be forced to gestate and give birth against their will. If we've established that both the pregnant person and fetus have the same human rights, then in the case of abortion, either the rights of the pregnant person or the rights of the fetus are violated. \n\nYour stance is that the rights of the pregnant person be violated, even temporarily, for the sake of having a child. You view the pregnant person and their rights as lesser than the rights of the fetus, given how you completely understand the effects of pregnancy and continue to advocate women endure all of it. You view the fetus and its rights as far more important, because you view the right to life as the most important right.\n\nIn short, your stance promotes the belief that women and their rights are of much lesser value than a fetus and its rights. My stance, my own belief, believes that women and their rights are more valuable and important than the fetus and its right to life.\n\n>It\u2019s simple. Don\u2019t want a kid? Don\u2019t have sex. Want sex too? Take precautions and realize that nothing is fool proof.\n\nThis just represents a completely lack of basic understanding of human psychology. People do not have sex strictly to have children. People have sex for pleasure. Married couples have sex for pleasure. Non-married couples have sex for pleasure. People have casual sex. Teenagers have sex for pleasure. Not every person has sex with the intention of having a child.\n\nIf I'm going by your logic, people (specifically women) must forego intimacy with their partner(s), must restrict their sexual lifestyles, must have their bodies regulated and controlled, must have their lives dictated by their biology and reproductive organs, and ultimately should either remain abstinent or get sterilized if they don't want children. This also deprives people, especially women, of the right to plan a family: some people DO want children, but at their own pace or time. You advocate that these people remain abstinent until they're ready to have children. You believe they should not lead normal, healthy, sexually active lifestyles if they don't want children. Even married couples want to have children but at their own time. Should these couples just forego intimacy and not have sex until they're ready to have children? Should people just never have sex at all unless they want children?\n\nYour claim that people should either have pro-creative sex, or remain abstinent, really demonstrates your worldview of just how human beings operate and how we interact with one another. It's not realistic at all, it won't work at all, and it's nothing short of horrific/sexist to advocate that women should either be virgins or have children on demand, whether they like it or not. \n\nOnce again, women should not be held back because of their biology. Women should not have their reproductive system dictate their entire lives. Women should not have their bodies and rights violated because they had sex. Women should not restrict their sex lives, forego intimacy with their partner(s), remain abstinent, put their emotional health + physical health + education + career + personal life + goals + hopes + dreams +. life in general ALL at stake, or on hold, for the sake of having a child. Women should not be stripped of their reproductive rights, sexual rights, and deserve every right to make important medical decisions regarding their own body, and should not be told they don't know what will affect them the most.\n\nBut, I suppose you believe these are all acceptable trade-offs, trivial matters, or that I am \"over-exaggerating\" everything.",
