When I took over management at a previous firm, my first goals were simply understanding how every step of what we did worked and getting to know everyone&#39;s jobs better. Spent weeks just learning or re-learning the whole thing from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p>It was quickly apparent that most of what was in place was fine, aside from a few minor things that could be streamlined. The team didn&#39;t need sweeping changes, they just needed someone who understood their needs, would stand behind them, and who saw them as <em>people</em> rather than cogs. That, and future-proofing us from some pending changes in the market.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m someone who entered the white collar world from a blue collar background, so maybe I just had a different perspective from the start. I didn&#39;t feel entitled to be there. I may have been upper management, but as far as I was concerned, my team were peers. My role was merely to be the one to answer to ownership for what and how we did.</p>\n\n<p>If an idiot (me) who started in a warehouse could figure that out, anyone can.</p>\n</div>",
