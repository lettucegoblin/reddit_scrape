However, a closer examination of his reign reveals that he may have been more progressive than history has given him credit for.\nIn fact, it's possible that Khan was one of the earliest proponents of women's rights in human history.\nOne example of this is Khan's policy towards marriage. When he wanted to form an alliance with another kingdom, he would often offer one of his daughters as a bride to the ruling monarch. This was a common practice among royal families at the time, but Khan had a twist: he would then send his new son-in-law to fight in the Mongol army, while his daughter took over the rule of the allied nation.\nThis may seem like a strange arrangement, but it had a practical purpose.

This amendment, known as the \"War Referendum Amendment,\" would have required a majority of voters to approve any declaration of war before it could be executed.\nBut that's not all. The War Referendum Amendment also included a provision that anyone voting yes on the referendum would have to register as a volunteer for service in the United States Army. This means that if you voted in favor of going to war, you would automatically become eligible for military service yourself.\nThis amendment was never ratified by Congress, but it's interesting to think about what might have happened if it had been.
