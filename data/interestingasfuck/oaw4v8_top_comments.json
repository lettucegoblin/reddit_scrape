My clinic sees so many backyard bred Frenchies, bred by selfish people who probably didn\u2019t even pass high school biology, because they\u2019re the new, trendy money maker. \n\nThese dogs are always horribly bred. We never see the adult dogs until the breeder brings the female in for a progesterone test to see if it\u2019s time to breed yet, or when it\u2019s time to euthanize. The puppies are born already struggling to breath. As most need c-sections, anesthesia is a nightmare for both mother and pups due to their squished faces and squat body conformation. C-sections in a \u201cnormal\u201d dog, are time sensitive as you don\u2019t want pups exposed to anesthetic gas for too long, it\u2019s even worse when the mother and pups can\u2019t breathe properly. Then you feel bad taking the ET tube out afterward because that\u2019s the best that dog has ever been able to breathe. \n\nThese people make at LEAST $2,000 per pup, yet come into my clinic and tell me they have no money for basic care. Their adult animals never have vaccinations, health screen blood work, or any basic care, and the pups? Sold as soon as possible with no health exams or shots. \n\nJust last week I had an owner bring in his new Frenchie puppy because he was limping. Turns out this 7 month old pup already has degenerative disc disease and will need to be on pain meds the rest of his life(Frenchies can also be prone to spinal issues due to breeding to make them more short and stocky looking). \n\nI once had one of these breeders have a female with a broken leg. We needed to change the splint and take X-rays to make sure the bone was healing correctly. He told me he couldn\u2019t afford it because he was taking a trip to Vegas. \n\nIf you think you hate these bad breeders, work in vet med for a day and you\u2019ll hate them even more.",

        "body": "Two years ago my parents gave me the call that my childhood dog wasn\u2019t doing well. She\u2019d had cancer for awhile but had started crashing. Her back legs failed her and she hadn\u2019t gotten up from her spot on the floor for a couple of days.\n\nShe and I were *so* bonded to one another. I drove a couple hours from where I was living at the time to be with her and when she saw me, she perked up a lot and used all her strength to sit up. I slept on the floor with her that night trying to convince my parents it was time to have her euthanized but they were reluctant. But by the next morning she was slowly getting up and moving around the house again, and by the afternoon she was actually jumping around for treats, so I knew my parents wouldn\u2019t take her to be put down.\n\nI go back to where I live and three days later get the call she was crashing again. I drove back down but this time was much worse. She could move her eyes and they brightened when she saw me and she knew I was there, but she couldn\u2019t move at all. My parents kept insisting they wanted her to pass at home but I got pissed and told them they\u2019re only prolonging her suffering. I slept on the floor with her again and in the morning I convinced my parents to take her to the vet. She was a bigger dog, so the vet came out to the car and gave the injections there and my dog passed peacefully in my lap. I still get upset thinking about how we should have had her put down when the first crash occurred, I worry about additional suffering she went through.\n\nAnd I miss her every day. Sorry for such a lengthy story, your comment just triggered vivid memories of that time. She was my best girl.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Two years ago my parents gave me the call that my childhood dog wasn\u2019t doing well. She\u2019d had cancer for awhile but had started crashing. Her back legs failed her and she hadn\u2019t gotten up from her spot on the floor for a couple of days.</p>\n\n<p>She and I were <em>so</em> bonded to one another. I drove a couple hours from where I was living at the time to be with her and when she saw me, she perked up a lot and used all her strength to sit up. I slept on the floor with her that night trying to convince my parents it was time to have her euthanized but they were reluctant. But by the next morning she was slowly getting up and moving around the house again, and by the afternoon she was actually jumping around for treats, so I knew my parents wouldn\u2019t take her to be put down.</p>\n\n<p>I go back to where I live and three days later get the call she was crashing again. I drove back down but this time was much worse. She could move her eyes and they brightened when she saw me and she knew I was there, but she couldn\u2019t move at all. My parents kept insisting they wanted her to pass at home but I got pissed and told them they\u2019re only prolonging her suffering. I slept on the floor with her again and in the morning I convinced my parents to take her to the vet. She was a bigger dog, so the vet came out to the car and gave the injections there and my dog passed peacefully in my lap. I still get upset thinking about how we should have had her put down when the first crash occurred, I worry about additional suffering she went through.</p>\n\n<p>And I miss her every day. Sorry for such a lengthy story, your comment just triggered vivid memories of that time. She was my best girl.</p>\n</div>",
