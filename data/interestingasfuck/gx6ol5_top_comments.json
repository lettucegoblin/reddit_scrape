        "body": "Uh..... I believe there was a typo when that was painted..... I mean does ONLY black lives matter or should it say ALL LIVES MATTER? I mean we are all human beings and as such every person\u2019s life should matter. Now if each race were considered a different species, well, then I could understand the reasoning for having a specific notation for a single race instead for all of humanity as a whole.\n\nNote.... I am a full blood native american who was born on a reservation, was sent to an Indian school, punished by having my mouth washed out with home made lye soap by the good sisters that taught us and the reason for this punishment was speaking my native tongue. Hand my left hand broken after repeated strikes with rulers because I was writing with the \u201cdevil\u2019s hand\u201d. I was left hand dominate. Was only allowed to go into businesses that would sell to native americans. could not drink at a white man\u2019s fountain nor swim in a white man\u2019s pool. The risk of being off the reservation alone could have meant being killed and even with a group still was a risk. Had to ride at the back of the bus along with african americans. \nNow this does not even cover what the american government did to my people along with other tribes prior to forcing my people onto reservations. How about the use of germ warfare, small pox infected blankets were given or traded to my people to attempt genocide of native americans. Or the non consent of sterilization of native american women without their knowledge or consent ( that this was back in the late 20th century). Or the Department of Health and Human Services that up until the mid to late 70\u2019s were going to native american reservations, stealing our children, taking them several states away then having them \u201cadopted\u201d along with providing the family with a blank birth certificate if the child was only listed on the tribal roll. When native americans were born on the reservation (I can only speak for the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. they were only added to the tribal roll as going to a white man town especially if the child was with you just wasn\u2019t safe. \n\nThere are still numerous things happening to my people. A pipe line company being allowed to dig through the Rosebud reservation in South Dakota is just one action (Which btw had been suppressed by previous Presidents UNTIL Trump came into office!!)\nReservation land is sovereign land of that tribe which means no local or state law enforcement has jurisdiction on it. Tribal law is observed and the only law enforcement allowed to investigate is the BIA and the FBI. There have been numerous deaths that have occurred to my people (some by greedy business owners who want something from the reservation land or by individuals who want something from reservation land. Numerous native americans along with their tribes are offended by the use of slang terms along with the image of what am ancestor would look like being used by the American sports. Like the \u201cRedskins\u201d is just an example. \nNow I am sure you are saying what is the big deal? Well what do you think would happen if instead of the name Redskins the name was Coons and depicted an African American? I would personally be appalled and want that removed and changed immediately!!!! Also I would like to point out, that besides the friends I had that are native american the first group of friends I had not native american were african american. As we both saw the same things in life but the only difference was I was able to go to the indian school where i had to stay. So don\u2019t for a single MINUTE call me a racist because I have experienced racism for the better part of my life. \n\nWith EVERYTHING I have gone through, You do not hear screaming RED LIVES MATTER!! Because my native american beliefs have taught me that every single life has a spirit and as such matters. That is why native americans will sing sing songs to the animal they have killed for food.... it is thanking that animal and it\u2019s spirit for giving it\u2019s life so that it can be used for not only food but also for materials so that nothing is wasted. At least that is how I was taught which was the old ways. I do not know about my people during a more modern time where it seems that a child is born with an electronic device in their hands that suddenly requires an OS update.\n\nI have seen racism. I have seen true hatred. I have seen men who wear sheets over their head and clothing who spew words of hatred but who are also cowards afraid to show their faces! \nAnd what happened to that young african american man was terrible and a crime the officer should be severely punished as a hate crime. That does not give people the right to loot, burn and destroy property nor harming of individuals who had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT, but were instead VICTIMS of another HATE CRIME!! But this time not by one or even a few individuals but because people just want to hate, destroy, harm others or take what does not belong to them, all in the name of Black Lives Matter. \nI know for a fact that every individual who was a part of these violent actions will be held accountable! The Great Spirit knows what you have done. And your deeds were not honorable thus EACH OF YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. \n\nALL life is a sacred thing. Whether it be the trees, plants, wildlife, fish in the ocean, pets or humans. Destroying mother earth is just a slow and painful way of committing genocide to every living thing. \n\nPLEASE remember that All Lives Matters.",

Now if each race were considered a different species, well, then I could understand the reasoning for having a specific notation for a single race instead for all of humanity as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Note.... I am a full blood native american who was born on a reservation, was sent to an Indian school, punished by having my mouth washed out with home made lye soap by the good sisters that taught us and the reason for this punishment was speaking my native tongue. Hand my left hand broken after repeated strikes with rulers because I was writing with the \u201cdevil\u2019s hand\u201d. I was left hand dominate. Was only allowed to go into businesses that would sell to native americans. could not drink at a white man\u2019s fountain nor swim in a white man\u2019s pool. The risk of being off the reservation alone could have meant being killed and even with a group still was a risk. Had to ride at the back of the bus along with african americans. \nNow this does not even cover what the american government did to my people along with other tribes prior to forcing my people onto reservations. How about the use of germ warfare, small pox infected blankets were given or traded to my people to attempt genocide of native americans. Or the non consent of sterilization of native american women without their knowledge or consent ( that this was back in the late 20th century). Or the Department of Health and Human Services that up until the mid to late 70\u2019s were going to native american reservations, stealing our children, taking them several states away then having them \u201cadopted\u201d along with providing the family with a blank birth certificate if the child was only listed on the tribal roll. When native americans were born on the reservation (I can only speak for the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. they were only added to the tribal roll as going to a white man town especially if the child was with you just wasn\u2019t safe. </p>\n\n<p>There are still numerous things happening to my people. A pipe line company being allowed to dig through the Rosebud reservation in South Dakota is just one action (Which btw had been suppressed by previous Presidents UNTIL Trump came into office!!)\nReservation land is sovereign land of that tribe which means no local or state law enforcement has jurisdiction on it. Tribal law is observed and the only law enforcement allowed to investigate is the BIA and the FBI. There have been numerous deaths that have occurred to my people (some by greedy business owners who want something from the reservation land or by individuals who want something from reservation land. Numerous native americans along with their tribes are offended by the use of slang terms along with the image of what am ancestor would look like being used by the American sports. Like the \u201cRedskins\u201d is just an example. \nNow I am sure you are saying what is the big deal? Well what do you think would happen if instead of the name Redskins the name was Coons and depicted an African American? I would personally be appalled and want that removed and changed immediately!!!! Also I would like to point out, that besides the friends I had that are native american the first group of friends I had not native american were african american. As we both saw the same things in life but the only difference was I was able to go to the indian school where i had to stay. So don\u2019t for a single MINUTE call me a racist because I have experienced racism for the better part of my life. </p>\n\n<p>With EVERYTHING I have gone through, You do not hear screaming RED LIVES MATTER!! Because my native american beliefs have taught me that every single life has a spirit and as such matters. That is why native americans will sing sing songs to the animal they have killed for food.... it is thanking that animal and it\u2019s spirit for giving it\u2019s life so that it can be used for not only food but also for materials so that nothing is wasted. At least that is how I was taught which was the old ways. I do not know about my people during a more modern time where it seems that a child is born with an electronic device in their hands that suddenly requires an OS update.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen racism. I have seen true hatred. I have seen men who wear sheets over their head and clothing who spew words of hatred but who are also cowards afraid to show their faces! \nAnd what happened to that young african american man was terrible and a crime the officer should be severely punished as a hate crime. That does not give people the right to loot, burn and destroy property nor harming of individuals who had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT, but were instead VICTIMS of another HATE CRIME!! But this time not by one or even a few individuals but because people just want to hate, destroy, harm others or take what does not belong to them, all in the name of Black Lives Matter. \nI know for a fact that every individual who was a part of these violent actions will be held accountable! The Great Spirit knows what you have done. And your deeds were not honorable thus EACH OF YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. </p>\n\n<p>ALL life is a sacred thing. Whether it be the trees, plants, wildlife, fish in the ocean, pets or humans. Destroying mother earth is just a slow and painful way of committing genocide to every living thing. </p>\n\n<p>PLEASE remember that All Lives Matters.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "For those who are interested in research-based solutions to stop police violence, here\u2019s what you need to know - based on the facts and data.\n\nLesson 1. Everything you\u2019ve probably heard is a lie. Specifically, the most discussed \u201csolutions\u201d to police violence have no evidence of effectiveness. For example, Body cams don\u2019t reduce police violence: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1\n\n2. There is no evidence that better police training programs or \u201cimplicit bias\u201d training changes police behavior. The trainings vary in quality and rarely result in any accountability/changes in decision-making. Don\u2019t put this at the top of your agenda. Next, what works...\n\n3. More restrictive state and local policies governing police use of force are associated with significantly lower rates of police shootings/killings by police. This is backed by 30+ years of research. Specific policies that work are identified here: http://useofforceproject.org/\n\n4. Demilitarization. Police departments that get more military weapons from the federal government kill more people. You can stop that from happening through local and state policy. Montana (Red state) has gone the furthest on this. Your state can and should follow. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885\n\n5. Police Union Contracts. Every 4-6 years your police department\u2019s accountability system is re-negotiated. Purging misconduct records, reinstating fired officers, department funding - it\u2019s in the contract. Cities with worse contracts have higher police violence rates. https://www.checkthepolice.org/\n\n6. Predictive policing on the police. Yes, use the technology against them. Data on use of force, complaints and lawsuits can be used to identify officers who are most likely to shoot someone next and prevent it from happening. Use the methodology to save lives. https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-predicting-bad-police-behavior-20190801-xumudeezmjalbbpmqwyvh26tdi-story.html\n\n7. Invest in alternatives to police as crime prevention strategies. Every 10 additional organizations in a city reduces the murder rate by 9%; reduces violent crime rate by 6%; and reduces property crime rate by 4%. The Research: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417736289\n\n8. Establish non-police alternatives to 911 calls involving people with mental illness. For example, 1 in 5 of the 911 calls in Eugene, Oregon are diverted to mental health first responders instead of police to respond. A successor is being scaled in Portland.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-mental-health-experts-not-police-are-the-first-responders-1543071600\n\n9. Resource the Department of Justice (after the current president is voted out) to initiate more investigations of police departments. Departments that receive federal intervention have 25-30% fewer police shootings than those that do not. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings\n\n10. Know change is not only possible, it\u2019s already happened in some places. Oakland police shot 8 people on average each year 5 years ago and, after these interventions were implemented, they had 0 shootings this year, 1 last year (the officers were fired) and 0 the year before. Lives saved.\n\n11. Finally, there is a catalog of an extensive range of research studies and other information detailing potential solutions to police violence at https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research\n\n12. And if you don\u2019t have time to read the research right now, most of this research is presented in rapid succession in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=1niaq51Z2Uw\n\nIn order to establish these findings they had to 1) build the most comprehensive database of police violence in the US; 2) conduct analyses of police use of force policies and union contracts in the 100 largest US cities; 3) track every state policing bill passed in the past 5 years; 4) track every research study published on the subject over the past five years and evaluate for quality; and 5) meticulously catalog the findings so they can be broadly accessible. And all that with little to no funding. Next up: evaluating the 1,000 largest police departments in the US. Stay tuned.\n\n(Source of all of the above: a thread from Samuel Sinyangwe @ https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224)",
