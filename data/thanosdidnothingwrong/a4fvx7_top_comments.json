Robin Williams was known for flashing people and humping people randomly. That\u2019s sexual assault. He still hosted a few Oscars. Kevin Hart has <del>one</del> tweets brought to light from almost ten years ago and people are flipping shit. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I want to mention that I am not bashing any of these comedians. I think they\u2019re all hilarious. And I have nothing but love for them. I\u2019m just tired of this celebrity worship mindset that\u2019s going on. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: apparently there were more than one tweet but my point still stands. </p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This has nothing to do with laws, protections, or punishments. Because this has nothing to do with the First Amendment. Nobody is arguing that Kevin Hart should be arrested, therefore it has nothing to do with the First Amendment, which just states that you have the right to say what you want without persecution from the government. It makes no sense to bring it up Hart and Gunn situations because the entities involved were corporations not the government. Public opinion has every right to be against what Hart said and not what Gunn said or vice versa, it has nothing to do with the idea of Free Speech because the protections of it do not give you freedom from being criticized or fired. To act like people are arguing against Free Speech by arguing in favor of the backlash against Kevin Hart is to straw man their argument as it is misrepresentative of their point and derails the conversation.</p>\n</div>",
