She wants her gift to look \u201cequal\u201d or something and feels that her son will not give a rats ass about anything she can afford to give him when compared to a car. \n\nSo instead of trying to accomplish the impossible task of living up to her dreams of giving her son a good gift, she\u2019d rather chip in and feel like she did *something* rather than get him like a little trinket that he forgets the moment he sees his car. No way she comes away for that moment emotionally unscathed, given how she feels so financially inadequate compared to you. She thinks you are the fun step parent because you can afford things she can\u2019t hope to ever give her son. She feels like an inadequate failure of a mother compared to you. \n\nThe united front is a nice perk of her chipping in for the car. But it probably isn\u2019t why she wants to do this. That said, a united front really is great for the child. And in terms of family unity and peace, giving the car together will make mom feel a whole lot better - and not doing this will feel antagonistic to her. Unless you want to accomplish that, I\u2019d take her 5% as an olive branch and hope she behaves nicer to you. \n\nShe calls you her ex\u2019s cash cow because she\u2019s insecure as fuck. Insecure people are mean, and mean specifically about the things that make them feel inadequate. Money is clearly a sore subject to her, and it being so free and easy for you (in terms of what she sees/her perspective, whether correct or not) makes her feel super shitty - and this she behaves shitty toward you. This 5% is probably all she can afford, and she\u2019ll take it as an affront that you turn it down. I\u2019m not saying it IS an affront, just what she will feel. \n\nThe choice is yours, but I think you do know the right thing to do for your stepson. It just requires you to do something you\u2019d rather avoid - and your feelings are very reasonable. I completely understand where you are coming from. I just think you need to weigh whether the outcomes of refusing her idea to contribute 5% to her son\u2019s very lavish gift (because a car gifted to you is lavish, even if it\u2019s normal for parents to do) is worth it. And if you do refuse her contribution, do you think you\u2019ll feel better? I can\u2019t answer that for you.",

No you do not have to let her get her way all the time. No just being civil and not talking negatively is not enough (But those are good things, props to you for those). Unfortunately this lady is now family, and so in addition to being civil and not talking bad, you have to approach her with understanding and try to empathize with her situation. This doesn't mean agreeing or capitulating, just getting where she's coming from. Note you are not really doing this for her, you are doing this for your kid, who will appreciate the example. (I know he's 18, but we never stop influencing the younger people in our lives, some of the most formative lessons we learn happen in our 20's, when we think we are \"Grown Up\".) \n\nYou do not have to so this, you do not have to let her in on this gift. But that action says something, as does allowing her. The question you have to ask is: \"What do I want to say, and why do I want to say that?\" \n\nYou sound like a good mom, don't let frustration at her behavior drag you down to her level.

Older men remarrying to younger women is a trope for a reason, and not a good reason.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how much that she&#39;s said, that she&#39;s been right about. I doubt he married a younger and richer girl, out of love, lol.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure from the mom&#39;s perspective, she just wants to be involved in this milestone in the kid&#39;s life, but the stepmom is &quot;once again&quot; upstaging her and flashing her good fortune everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>YTA OP. You could just let her be involved. How isolating do you think it is to be the divorced mom? I&#39;m sure she feels separate enough as it is. Let her be involved even if it&#39;s only a little bit, sheesh.</p>\n</div>",

The mom offering to pitch in on the gift, no matter if it was 5% or 50%, was just a perfect way to fuck with OP. She says yes, and now she has to share this nice gesture that was conceived between OP and the dad with someone who openly hates her. She says no, and she gets to look like an asshole. I think the offer alone was shitty; when people want others in on a joint gift, they throw it out there, &quot;hey, we&#39;re doing this for x, want to contribute?&quot; You don&#39;t shove yourself in there.</p>\n</div>",
