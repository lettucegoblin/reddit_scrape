One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said \"Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become.\" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was. \n\nNow, this is a big myth.

You don't have a lot of other piercings and that's so intimate. How did the procedure work?\"\n\n\"Were you scared?\" \n\n\"I've heard that over time that can really reduce sensitivity. Is that why you took it out?\" \n\nHer answers were strange. Later that year we would all start learning that she was a compulsive liar. I am as certain as I am that the moon exists that she never had it pierced as she's never told a true story ever. All of her \"interesting\" stories were similarly extreme. \n\nBUT, what is even crazier than the lie was that I started to realize from her answers that she was talking about her labia. I started asking some basic anatomy and location questions and was like \"I think you're telling me you had your labia pierced. Not your clit. Like the lips on the side is what you're describing.\" and she was like \"Yeah! My clit!\" I was pretty polite, but maybe I laughed a bit because the whole situation was so bizarre and we all had been drinking. I was genuinely concerned for her because she was in her early 40s and IMO this lack of information is a sign of serious neglect, which I guess explains the lying.\n\nShe got furious with me and after a bit of arguing and her telling me I didn't know what I was talking about she settled on that it's a well known nickname for the whole area. I'm still pretty certain she doesn't know that clit is short for clitoris but I also don't think she tells that fake ass story anymore.",

All of her &quot;interesting&quot; stories were similarly extreme. </p>\n\n<p>BUT, what is even crazier than the lie was that I started to realize from her answers that she was talking about her labia. I started asking some basic anatomy and location questions and was like &quot;I think you&#39;re telling me you had your labia pierced. Not your clit. Like the lips on the side is what you&#39;re describing.&quot; and she was like &quot;Yeah! My clit!&quot; I was pretty polite, but maybe I laughed a bit because the whole situation was so bizarre and we all had been drinking. I was genuinely concerned for her because she was in her early 40s and IMO this lack of information is a sign of serious neglect, which I guess explains the lying.</p>\n\n<p>She got furious with me and after a bit of arguing and her telling me I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about she settled on that it&#39;s a well known nickname for the whole area. I&#39;m still pretty certain she doesn&#39;t know that clit is short for clitoris but I also don&#39;t think she tells that fake ass story anymore.</p>\n</div>",

So I\u2019d rather shut someone down a little _too_ aggressively when it\u2019s not always called for, unfairly rude as that may be, than second guess myself and let it happen.
