But output from both these pathways can be modified consciously, enabling us to suppress emotional expressions when it seems inappropriate and probably why some people can put forth the most genuine looking fake smile.\n\nI guess if a person is anxious or insecure, the emotional centre would be trying to activate a pathway for a different facial expression (not the one for smiling) whereas the \"volitional\" centre would be literally trying to force the smile, (and its working would be hampered by the mental state,  like when you feel tensed up( eg: meeting a crush) , even simple tasks become impossibly hard(eg: talking coherently).
