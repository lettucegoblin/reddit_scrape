You\u2019re 17. You should be proud of yourself. You shouldn\u2019t have to hide that. But I\u2019d caution you to remember that people of all educational backgrounds are valuable in all industries. And beyond that, where you go to school does not, and should not, be the only thing that defines you as a person.</p>\n\n<p>This PSA from a proud H alumni who is desperately trying to rehabilitate his school\u2019s image as a bunch of rich, pretentious snobs.</p>\n</div>",

Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he\u2019d say things like \u201cOnce I\u2019m at H....\u201d or \u201cAfter I go to H, my plan is...\u201d. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. \n\nJake and I got along pretty well, we\u2019d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He\u2019d refuse to study together, look over each other\u2019s essays, and he\u2019d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. \n\nThen, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. \n\nI once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for \u201cshowing off\u201d, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. \n\nHonestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it\u2019d get better after the summer, once college actually started. \n\nIt has not. Now it\u2019s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he\u2019s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. \n\nMy classes start soon, so I\u2019ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We\u2019ve always both worn headphones, there\u2019s literally no distraction.

If not, then point out that you weren\u2019t in direct competition with him so you couldn\u2019t have \u201ctaken his spot\u201d or anything. (Eg if you applied for Biology and he applied for History). If you did actively compete for the same program then that makes it a bit more complicated, but you\u2019re still not the reason why he didn\u2019t get in. Your grades, extracurriculars and any essays you had to submit would be what got you a position. </p>\n\n<p>Unless your parents step in then you do recognize he is going to continue sabotaging your academics right? If he was already going to try to decline your acceptance and cleared out your desk.... you do know that means he\u2019s willing to do thinks like \u201cspill coffee\u201d onto your computer hardrive, cut out the internet when you need to sign in for a lecture, etc, right?</p>\n\n<p>Talk to your parents. If your bedroom is too small for a study (quite frankly you can use your laptop on your bed it isn\u2019t that difficult to do all your school work in a really small room) then ask your parents if they\u2019d be willing to switch rooms for you for this semester. If they don\u2019t want to parent either of you and teach you how to be respectful adults then hopefully they will at least be willing to accept that the cost of buying multiple new laptops in a year might be more annoying than switching rooms. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sorry your brother is being such an ass, but you\u2019re not acting a whole lot better than him atm.</p>\n</div>",

I can't say from your post whether this is true in your situation; but I think approaching him from the angle of expressing how his own passion for getting into this school and the competitive drive he fostered between you has actually benefited *you* by encouraging your own hard work and determination to be accepted to what sounds like a very respectable University. I won't say that you should lie if you disagree with this being valid in your situation, but regardless I think it would be a kindness to him to try and make him feel like he is a part of your (and while it still is absolutely your's that you deservedly earned) success, while also possibly making it easier for him to join you in celebrating your achievement. I think its typically easier for him as (your) sibling to rejoice in *our* success than it would to do the same for *your* success. I wouldn't go any further than this in sharing my thoughts, and would render no verdict here either, because with the dynamic between siblings, especially those that are close in age like this, applying the normal societal \"rules\" (and *particularly* not the obviously mercurial and arbitrary mob rules seemingly followed by reddit and the members of this sub particularly) is almost never practical nor reasonable in actual application. I think based on your post its obvious you care about your brother and likely even look up to him as a role model, so your heart is already in a good place evidenced by your comments empathizing with his situation. As a younger sibling myself, I know its hard, but I would encourage you to listen to your metaphorical heart more than your logical/egocentric (I don't say egocentric as a bad thing, it's just the inherent nature of human psychology to put our own feelings and desires before anyone elses) mind.

Instead of confronting him and correcting his behavior, which admittedly requires an initial commitment of time and energy, their parents have chosen to steady the boat. That is, they are insisting that OP change *his own* behavior so that the parents don't have to do the hard work of parenting. They are letting both their sons down.\n\nOP, my verdict is a soft NTA. I don't blame you for hitting back, but I'm going to suggest that you look at this more strategically than tactically. Think of tactics as the medium- to small-scale decisions made in regards to the battle you're currently fighting. Strategy is the large-scale planning done to win the war. Strategy is whether or not you'll fight the battle. Tactics are how you fight the battle. \n\nKnowing that your parents aren't going to correct your brother's behavior, you need to decide what your priorities are. Your relationship with your brother? You can't choose his behavior, only how you respond to it. While a slightly disproportionate response to his efforts to take his anger out on you can convince him it's not a wise decision, it damages your future relationship. On the other than, letting him beat up on you doesn't make your relationship healthy or happy. He is in charge of himself; you are in charge of yourself. Your relationship with your parents? Well, they've shown that they can't be counted on to do the hard work of parenting, so you're very likely not going to get everything you wanted. Set your expectations accordingly, and you're more likely to be happy.\n\nCollege? College is what determines your education, your career, your future friendships and romantic relationships, as well as your income potential. It is literally the one factor in this equation that you have control over. Strategically, this is the priority you have the best chance of making happen. Understand that pursuing it may bring you into more conflict with your brother and parents and that you may have to make the decision to put college first, and that may require things like moving out, finding work, and taking on loan debt.

Dad usually says things like, \u201cJust tolerate it, your brother is hurting right now, but it will get better once \\[milestone in a few months from the talk\\]\u201d\n\nThat is the most cowardly parenting I've ever seen.

The truth is, his rejection is a constant reminder because of himself and his own expectations. You are just an easy outlet for him, to blame you for whatever, and lying to himself that they mixed you guys up or you only got in because you\u2019re a girl. \n\nHonestly, you probably are better off finding a quiet and secluded place to study away from your brother. I can imagine him trying to sabotage your education. Don\u2019t give him the opportunity. Steer clear, distance yourself from him. Worry ONLY ABOUT YOURSELF. He needs to figure out on his own why he\u2019s so mad and why he is going through this. He needs to be humbled and I think the universe is showing him that he got exactly what he deserved.",

The truth is, his rejection is a constant reminder because of himself and his own expectations. You are just an easy outlet for him, to blame you for whatever, and lying to himself that they mixed you guys up or you only got in because you\u2019re a girl. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, you probably are better off finding a quiet and secluded place to study away from your brother. I can imagine him trying to sabotage your education. Don\u2019t give him the opportunity. Steer clear, distance yourself from him. Worry ONLY ABOUT YOURSELF. He needs to figure out on his own why he\u2019s so mad and why he is going through this. He needs to be humbled and I think the universe is showing him that he got exactly what he deserved.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "(Reposting due to mod removal):\n\nThe SAT/ACT/etc has much less bearing on admissions at elite colleges in the US than entrance exams in other countries. The SAT and other similar exams don't cover much difficult content (there's no science, calculus, history, or well, anything other than rudimentary reading, grammar, and algebra on it). Having worked as a SAT tutor, I can say that most kids of average or higher intelligence can be coached to a good score, so you can't even conclude that someone with a near perfect score is *that* smart.  The scores themselves are kind of meaningless after a certain threshold (1600/1600 won't help you more than a 1550/1600), and there are too many kids with good scores for them all to be selected. Compare this to say, the Gaokao in China, which comprehensively covers high school material and is actually hard enough to decisively differentiate between students. \n\nUsually the final push for a non-legacy/non-donor kid to get into an Ivy+ school comes from the essays (eg: good writer, tells a story, exhibits personality traits that the admissions office is promising) or extracurriculars (eg: olympiad awards, published papers, great art portfolio, raising money for their nonprofit, etc). So if the brother wants to reapply after senior year, retaking the SAT won't be helpful. Chances are, he already had a good score. Instead, he'd need some pretty impressive activities to justify taking a gap year.\n\nTransferring to these kinds of schools is also hard. Harvard's, for instance, is <1%. You need to demonstrate that 1) there's something at H that you can't get at your current school, 2) you're a good fit for H and will contribute to the community and prestige, and 3) you've done already pretty impressive things at your current university. \n\nIn other words, while the bro can try to reapply, the odds are even lower than they were the first time around. It doesn't justify his behavior, though; a lot of American public/state universities are hella good, and he's being *expletive to abide by Rule 1*. \n\n(Since the brother looks down at kids in state schools, I'm assuming H is an Ivy level school.)",

Please make sure you: \n\n(1) Have disk encryption enabled on your computer (this is called FileVault on Mac; not sure what it\u2019s called on PC). Depending on what kind of computer you have, this may or may not be enabled by default. This is important because without it someone can just plug your hard drive into another computer and access all your data without your password.\n\n(2) Choose a secure, memorable password and don\u2019t tell anyone what it is. Here\u2019s a [helpful password generator](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) that explains its methodology. You may also want to use a password manager like 1Password for any logins you use for school purposes as well as your main email account.\n\n(3) Make sure there are no easy ways to get around your passwords. That means no hints and no security questions. If you\u2019re forced to fill in an answer for a security question, fill the field with random junk or something unrelated (but perhaps store it securely somewhere only you can find it; maybe in a password manager). It doesn\u2019t matter how secure your password is when someone can get into your account just by knowing the make and model of your first car, the name of your first pet, or the street you grew up on.\n\n(4) Make sure you lock your computer screen whenever you\u2019re not actively using it. Physical security is important.\n\n(5) Enable 2-factor authentication wherever you\u2019re able to. This adds a huge amount of strength to your security because you need your physical phone to log in.\n\n(6) Secure your phone!!! Make sure your password is strong and no one knows it but you.\n\nWhen someone has already targeted your device with the intent to impersonate you, all these steps are important. They\u2019re actually not that inconvenient, but I don\u2019t really know anyone outside of the tech industry who does this. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
