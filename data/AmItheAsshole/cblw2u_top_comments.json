There is... a lot to unpack here, but I'm going to try to because it seems you are genuinely mystified by all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me put it this way. Paying to watch your favorite team play in the Superbowl Live is not only stupid, but its also a ridiculous waste of money. Paying hundreds of dollars to sit surrounded by sweaty, screaming, drunken fans acting like it's their child that's playing in the game is the worst possible way I can think of to spend any amount of time short of going to jail, being tortured, or some other horrible experience that you also wouldn't pay for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yet, if during the game, I started arguing with the people that worked at the stadium loudly, in a way which would distract them from the very expensive game they paid to watch...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be the ahole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all, I could have looked at the price of the ticket before hand. I could have done my due diligence before walking into their business, making my loud complaining to some employee who is just trying to make rent a source of unhappiness and discomfort for everyone that can hear me complain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if we went as friends, and I was causing this scene in the stadium...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might feel pretty damn embarrassed. You might wish I would just shut the fuck up and ~~eat my damn steak~~  watch the damn game in silence so that at least ONE of us would be able to enjoy ourselves. After all, just because I think the Superbowl is a stupid, expensive, waste of time, that doesn't mean that you do. For you, it's worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, from your perspective, you felt this restaurant falsely advertised an appetizer as an entree, underserved you, overcharged you, and so you caused a big scene, embarrassed your girlfriend, disrupted the meal of the other patrons, and then stiffed some poor waiter out of a tip because he served you the food you ordered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd from her perspective, she was excited to be going to a fancy new restaurant with someone she cares about, she was likely hoping you would be impressed with it, she sounds like she enjoys the type of food they serve and the overall experience that is a part of the small portions of high-quality food that is NORMAL for \"fine dining\", and everything was going so GREAT until...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBam. You start bitching and moaning, loudly. Some people probably were looking at you, and she started to feel mortified because you clearly did NOT appreciate \"fine dining\" the way she did. And then... you basically began to act like a red neck at a country club by yelling at the waiter, the owner, making crazy demands over $60 (which is about the price of a tank of gas in a medium-sized car), stiffed the waiter, ran out on the bill, while ignoring her practically BEGGING you to let it go so that she could enjoy what was left of the evening. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a \"fancy\" restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow many hours did she take to get ready? Who was she trying to look pretty for? The waiter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo you big galut - she was looking nice for YOU because she was planning on showing YOU how greatful she was for taking her out to a \"fancy\" $30 per person meal (seriously... this is not fucking expensive. I've spent more than this at Chili's, let alone at actual fine dining establishments. This is like... midwest fine dining in a town with the population in the triple digits. This is NOT expensive at ALL! I've easily spent $200 for a dinner for 2 at a similar style establishment.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no. After spending hours preparing for this date at a fancy restaurant, spending all day getting her hopes up, you raise a stink over the cost of a tank of gas, as if she isn't worth blowing a wad of cash on dinner on, embarrass her, ignore her discomfort, dine and dash, stiff the waiter, bitch and moan the entire time, and then take her and her nice outfit so that you can grab a fast-food burger, demonstrating to her that she's involved with Jed Clampett and causing her to question why the hell she's with you if you can't consider how your behavior might have been making her feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver $60.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou ignored your girlfriend over $60. You might have \"saved\" that $60, but you lost a lot of her respect because you didn't realize that this \"waste of money\" was her version of the Superbowl.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA because the reason why they didn&#39;t twist your arm is that you were making a scene and ruining the ambiance of their restaurant.

Paying to watch your favorite team play in the Superbowl Live is not only stupid, but its also a ridiculous waste of money. Paying hundreds of dollars to sit surrounded by sweaty, screaming, drunken fans acting like it&#39;s their child that&#39;s playing in the game is the worst possible way I can think of to spend any amount of time short of going to jail, being tortured, or some other horrible experience that you also wouldn&#39;t pay for. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And yet, if during the game, I started arguing with the people that worked at the stadium loudly, in a way which would distract them from the very expensive game they paid to watch...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be the ahole. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>After all, I could have looked at the price of the ticket before hand.
