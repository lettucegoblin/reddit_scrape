He treats you like dirt, he not only belittles you but does it in front of/with others. You\u2019re being ganged up on and because you have no one there on your side, they\u2019re starting to trick you into thinking you\u2019re the problem. You are not!</p>\n\n<p>Newborns need to feed every 2 hours. They need to bond with their <em>parents</em> above all others. Anyone who tries to sabotage your bonding with and taking care of your son, whether it\u2019s MIL or your husband, is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Go to your parents. You and your son need a safe place to be where you can concentrate on both of your health. </p>\n\n<p>Then when you\u2019re ready, think long and hard about if you want to stay married to a man that puts you down, screams at you, and puts his mother above you AND your son. If you stay with him, which I hope you don\u2019t, you both need serious therapy first where he can learn to treat you with dignity and respect before you should ever live under the same roof as him again.</p>\n</div>",

I know you feel like a terrible mother, because your child's father and in-laws have convinced you of it, are trying to brainwash you when you're exhausted and in pain and stressed out of your mind.\n\nFirst. I want you to know *they are lying to you.* Everything I've read here tells me you are a very good mommy. You love your son. You care more about his needs than your wants, unlike everyone else. You are the *only person in that house who truly loves that baby because real love is not selfish.* I know you'd die for your son, no questions asked.\n\nI need you to listen to me very carefully as a woman who has been in your position before. ***you and your baby are in danger.*** And you are the only one who can protect your very vulnerable newborn. You need to move *now* before something truly disastrous happens.\n\nHere is what to do:\n\nHave your phone in hand at all times. Pack your documents (drivers license, passport, social security card, birth certificate and marriage license, and your sons SS card and birth certificate). ONE change of clothes for you and baby, along with just one handful of diapers. A phone charger. Your credit/debit card. Grab your keys, get in the car and drive.\n\nDrive straight to your parents house. Once you are a fair distance from your house, park and call your parents and tell them you're coming over and it's an emergency. Put the car in drive and keep going. Don't stop until you get there. If your parents don't pick up, pound on the door until they wake up. You and your parents can get whatever supplies you need from there.\n\nIf at any point your husband intercepts you while you're doing this packing (this should take 5-7 minutes AT THE MOST) take the baby, lock yourself in a room or bathroom AND CALL THE POLICE. Record the phone call. If he is banging on the door, screaming and threating you that recording will come VERY in handy for court and custody.\n\nTell the cops your husband and his parents are holding you hostage and are threatening to hurt you and the baby (they are. Your MIL won't give you your child and cares more about having power over a 1 month old than letting him eat so he won't be in pain. Your husband wants his son to feel pain so his mommy dearest can hold him, he yells and screams in front of the baby. He makes you beg and perform tasks for him before he releases the baby to you. He tells you aren't allowed to leave the house. This isn't a lie)\n\nThe police will come and help escort you off the property. Make it clear to the police you and your baby are in danger and being held hostage. Now is not the time to play nice. You beg for thier help when they are there, you tell them if they leave you and the baby will be in danger. Trust me, there is a 99% chance the cops will be on your side. Do not let them leave until either you can go or they take your husband and his parents off the property. \n\nYou can worry about the divorce later (and there 100% should be one). The main goal is *survival* and *getting the hell away from your dangerous husband and parents.* You and your son are not safe until they are gone. I know you can't see it and don't want to believe it, but women in your position and babies die from this sort of thing. The bad behavior is escalating and will only get worse.\n\nPlease believe me. I've been there. I know how hard it is. I know you never thought this could happen to you. You're going to feel crazy and lots of self-doubt and wonder if you are completely over-reacting (your husband and parents are going to tell you that you are). Ask yourself what is worse? Possibly over reacting to a situation? Or you and your baby dead? You can do this. I know you can.",

I know that if I'm willing to do this, others will be, so we can find you a way out even if you don't feel safe reaching out to your close network of family and friends. At the very least we can help find shelters close to you or maybe a room for the night if you can't get to one immediately and are afraid of performing that search on your own.\n\nAbusers often isolate their victims from friends and family and work to drive wedges between them, so if you're finding yourself unable to think of a single person to call, just know this is *not your fault* and in *no way* a reflection on you, your worth as a mother, daughter, friend, nor how much love and safety is available to you outside your current situation. If you're from a more insular community where everyone you know is taught to push you back toward your husband despite his treatment of you, this is all still true, and just know that there *are* resources available to you and people who want to help. There *is* a way out.\n\nIf you were taught to need permission from your husband to leave or do anything, please listen to everyone here telling you this isn't the case. I know it's hard to trust the idea that you can make your own choice to leave after living with the opposite understanding for so long, so it may help to focus on the fact that in families where a wife is meant to fully submit to her husband, her husband's job is to keep her safe and honor her role as a mother to their children, whom he's *also* meant to keep safe. Your husband has failed on both counts, so you shouldn't fear exercising your right to leave. It is *not* a betrayal of your role nor commitments to anyone. Above all else your commitment is to yourself and now your child.\n\nAs others have said, please, please, please find a way to get out of that house ASAP, and quietly (pack quickly and lightly and do not announce your intentions, arrange for a way to walk outside and immediately get into a safe vehicle, be it your own, a family member's or friend's, or an uber that will take you to a safe place for the night... just go). If it's easiest to do this while everyone else is asleep, be prepared to leave right after a nightly feeding, which others won't question why you're up and about in the middle of the night, by making necessary arrangements now, or *asking for help* in making them. The biggest hurdle is often having a clear and tangible, place to go when the moment arrives, but once that is settled, the rest will be much easier.\n\nI know you're exhausted, and I know you feel trapped, and hopeless. Your language describing your husband \"not allowing\" you to leave says more than enough. Your surroundings are only making your exhaustion worse, and taking even just the first step to extricate yourself will lighten an incredibly heavy load of stress you may not even realize you're carrying. \n\nYou can do this. The fact that you turned to strangers and were able to question the \"normal\" that has been crafted to harm you and keep you afraid of considering outside possibilities is a HUGE step.
