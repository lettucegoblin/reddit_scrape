She probably passes most of them. Maybe aces a lot of them. Your father would go broke shelling out $300 for each passed test, right? So it\u2019s clear the $300 he gave her wasn\u2019t for her test because who can afford that?\n\nYour dad gave that $300 to his gf in hopes of you three girls having a fun time together and bonding, doing girly things. Shopping or pedicures or Starbucks or whatever. He trusted your girlfriend with that much money in hopes that she would spend it ensuring ALL THREE OF YOU had a good day together. \n\nThis is why the second you walked in the door with no Starbucks your dad didn\u2019t simply assume you finished yours first, he instead immediately asked where yours was. Because he wanted to make sure his money was spent the way he intended- on all three of you equally. \n\nThis makes me think he plans to marry this woman, because he wants you guys to bond and become a family. But the girlfriend clearly isn\u2019t interested in bonding because she\u2019s obviously an entitled brat who wants your dad to provide for her child but has no interest in returning the favor and providing for you.\n\nIn the future I encourage you to continue speaking up when she pulls stunts like this so your dad knows how she treats you. I would also make sure he knows NONE of the money that she spent at the mall was spent on you either. Not because you feel entitled to it, since you obviously don\u2019t, but because he likely intended some of it to go to you and none of it did, and he deserves to know that because it\u2019s his money.

My point is, its a crappy situation to be in, especially at your age, and with your mom far away, but I hope you realise that your feelings are a 100% valid and your dad's GF is a manipulative AH. It's highly unlikely she would have acted like that if your dad was with you guys, so if I were you I'd respectfully decline to spend any time with her or her daughter that doesn't involve your dad.",

To dismiss a child in your custody even if only for an outing is immature, selfish and rude. Sounds like the gf doesn&#39;t like that OPs dad had a life before her. She needs to get over herself and start treating both kids with  same respsct while OP is living there. Even though she&#39;s not married to the dad she&#39;s in a position of mother in that house so to ignore one kid and favoring the other is not only damaging to OP, if the dad has any sense he should see it as a red flag in his relationship too.</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add OP is obviously NTA</p>\n</div>",

There was 1 girl who didn&#39;t have money for a drink, so I paid for her drink along with ours.   I&#39;m glad my daughter knew she could come to me and that I&#39;d make it right.</p>\n</div>",

I know you may doubt if telling your dad was the right thing, but let me assure you that you handled it *perfectly.* \n\nIf you had 'made a scene' in the store, or yelled at her in the car on the way home, the girlfriend would have used that to manipulate the narrative with your dad. She would have gone on the offense the instant she saw him, saying how problematic you were by throwing a temper tantrum the whole time. When you'd naturally react to deny her lies, she'd point at you and say \"see what I mean?! She just keeps arguing and being disrespectful! You should have seen how embarrassing she was at the mall!\"\n\nWhen you remained composed until your dad asked where your drink was, you took away some of the girlfriends power. You also stood up for yourself, which I'm so incredibly proud of you for!  That woman was depending on your silence, thinking she'd crushed your spirit. She didn't succeed, because of your inner strength and resolve. I want you to be proud of yourself for that!\n\nI know you aren't really a child anymore, but there's still a lot of things you'll learn over time with experience. Eventually you're going to look back at this moment, and realize how much more heartless the girlfriend is than you had thought. She is likely sees you as competition for your father's time, money, and love. To be so callous towards you shows a serious gap in compassion and empathy, but it goes beyond that. She willfully chose to hurt you, trying to make you feel like an interloper. \n\nPlease believe me when I say absolutely none of her behavior was your fault.

She wanted to put my feverish brother in a 3 hour train ride. I put my foot down, managed to get help (her ex husband helped us) and took him to hospital (he was ok, tonsilitis but he was fine with antibiotics and paracetamol) and then nursed him all night while she had her friend over and got drunk, complaining that we had ruined her plans. I called my father to tell him how awful this was. Not only did he defend her, he ended up marrying her. If I hardly visited my father before because of prior abuse (tbh I only went because my brother went), after this, it was almost NC.</p>\n</div>",
