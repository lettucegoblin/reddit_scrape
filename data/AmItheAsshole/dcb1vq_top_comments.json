Forgiving someone else is for yourself, not for the other party. \n\nIf I wrong you, my intention in apologizing is to try to help you feel better. To show self-awareness and help to make you feel more comfortable that because I've identified the mistake that I will be less likely to commit it again. \n\nBut I require nothing back from you. I don't necessarily deserve your trust after that point. I haven't undone anything, I've only admitted that I recognize that it was me that was in error and implied that it's not something that I want to repeat. \n\nSimilarly, if you choose to forgive me, that's not for my benefit. It's not something I can demand, nor is it something that I am owed.  Your decision to forgive me is something that you choose to do to put your own mind at ease, so that you can start to rebuild that connection if you think it's worthwhile. \n\nDemanding the acceptance of an apology, demanding forgiveness, those are selfish actions. If someone \"apologizes\" to you and then becomes upset when you describe how it hurt you, that isn't an apology, it's more abuse. A true apology would be the acknowledgement that you did something hurtful.  If someone describes how they felt because of that hurtful thing, a real apology would have you accept that, and maybe commit to never putting them or anyone else in that position again. \n\nBy demanding forgiveness, you're not acknowledging the wrong.  You're actually trying to minimize it. You're saying 'Oh, I said the magic words so that pain doesn't exist any more.'\n\nThere's a certain narcissism there. \n\nThis happens before any misgendering.  I don't know if the particular statement was rude or not.  I do think however, if the bully was being sincere in the apology the statement may have not even been made, and similarly, they would have accepted a response even more rude as the intention of an apology should be to help that other party feel better and process those frustrations. \n\nIf she said, \"Yeah, I understand.  I wasn't acting like a reasonable person then. I hope I won't act that way again. Living as though I was that boy was hurting me too and it made it hard to keep my head on straight, and referring to me that way now continues to hurt and frustrate me.   I'm going to do my best not to hurt anyone like I hurt you back then.  Would you be willing to avoid referring to me as that boy in the future?\"\n\nLike, something like that seems at least sincere.  It's not saying \"Hey you're wrong for having those feelings/memories\" instead it's saying \"I'm here to say I screwed up and I don't want to hurt you.

You have to know that it&#39;s never, ever going to be okay! I&#39;m dying! I&#39;m not gonna feel better! And I&#39;m not gonna be your prop so you can feel better! Do you know what it was like for me? I had nobody. Everybody left! I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me, sure. But you? I don&#39;t care about the job! I did fine! I had a good life, but what I needed then was... a friend. And you abandoned me. And I will never forgive you for that. Now get the fuck out of my house!\nHe also gives Bojack a second, more bitter one after the two fight.\nHerb: You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you&#39;re not. In fact, you&#39;d probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you&#39;re a selfish goddamn coward who just takes whatever he wants and doesn&#39;t give a shit about who he hurts. That&#39;s you. That&#39;s Bojack Horseman.</p>\n\n<p>Not from memory, all credit and glory be to the googz</p>\n</div>",
