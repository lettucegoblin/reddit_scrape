You don't impose punishments when she is already doing things exactly right!\n\nNow, in a perfect world, you and her never trip up once and your stepsons grief is never triggered (at least while it is so fresh).

Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because \"oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone\". \n\nI stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. \n\nAnya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. \n\nFew months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. \n\nA week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. \n\nSince then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. \n\nLater that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. \n\nI was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the \"She is my daughter, not yours\" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. \n\nWhether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. \n\nOf course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. \n\nBoth of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kids are really like sponges when it comes to learning languages he&#39;s a little older but it&#39;ll still be easier for him than an adult. Obviously have a conversation about it first but then you can put the TV on in Hindi with English subtitles that&#39;s an easy way for him to at least understand it!</p>\n</div>",

I'm trilingual(ish), and fully comfortable in two languages when it comes to academic things or every day things. But there's one language I think in, feel in, journal in, do maths in... If I were going to see a therapist, I'd find someone who spoke that language, and I'm glad every day that my partner speaks that language. If I had to sing a lullaby, it'd be in that language. Languages are relational and emotional. You can't cut Anya off from that. Is your husband bilingual? Because it's hard to understand this if you aren't.\n\nThe thing is, Ben is feeling excluded because his mother died and there are things you share with Anya that you don't share with him, which reminds him that she has her bio mom and he doesn't. That's heartbreaking for everyone, but he could also have felt sad if, say, he saw you braiding Anya's hair everyday and realised it wasn't a thing for him. If they were older, he might feel sad seeing you do 'girly\" things with your daughter. With younger kids, a kid who just lost a mom might cry because a younger sibling is being breast/bottle fed and not them. A girl who lost a dad might feel sad if they saw their step-dad walking their step-sister down the aisle at their wedding. The kid who lost a parent is absolutely justified in being sad at the reminder that there are things that they don't have! But that doesn't mean that you have to punish the other child for having their own needs.\n\nDo you have much one on one time with Ben? I don't mean this in a \"replace his mom\" sense, but I do think that it might help if he had some time with you or his dad where he was the center of attention, and a way to reassure him that he is fully a part of the family. Hindi lessons later maybe, but also outings or play or some kind of ritual that's his and his alone (ie some dads might make a weekly ritual of getting mcdonalds with their kid every saturday lunch, or going to the library together once a week, or going camping together a week-end per month, things along those lines?)",

My parents are fluent in English and have lived in the States since I was a baby, but they have always spoken Tamil at home when it's just the family. I can't speak Tamil but I can understand it, so for the past 20+ years they have been used to speaking to me in Tamil and having me respond in English. \n\nSometimes they'll accidentally say something in Tamil to my white husband and he can't understand them. It's not intentional or exclusionary on my parents' part, its just HARD to always censor what language you're speaking in! Especially in your own home where you're accustomed to speaking your native tongue. My husband gets a little frustrated if there's a entire conversation happening in Tamil around him but that's only because he wants to be included and participate in the conversation. He would never think to ask that they NEVER speak Tamil. I just gently remind my parents they are speaking a language he can't understand and they will usually apologize and switch back because they hadn't realized they were doing it. My husband has even asked me if I think he should learn Tamil so he can be included more easily! \n\nAnd as a side note, it is pretty frustrating to me that I cannot speak Tamil. This happened because I was encouraged to only speak English when I was young, and I lost whatever Tamil I spoke as a little kid. I could learn it again with some formal instruction, maybe, but it still sucks. Please don't let your husband bully Anya into giving up her first language - she's still pretty young and could honestly lose a lot of her ability to speak it.",

My parents are fluent in English and have lived in the States since I was a baby, but they have always spoken Tamil at home when it&#39;s just the family. I can&#39;t speak Tamil but I can understand it, so for the past 20+ years they have been used to speaking to me in Tamil and having me respond in English. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes they&#39;ll accidentally say something in Tamil to my white husband and he can&#39;t understand them. It&#39;s not intentional or exclusionary on my parents&#39; part, its just HARD to always censor what language you&#39;re speaking in! Especially in your own home where you&#39;re accustomed to speaking your native tongue. My husband gets a little frustrated if there&#39;s a entire conversation happening in Tamil around him but that&#39;s only because he wants to be included and participate in the conversation. He would never think to ask that they NEVER speak Tamil. I just gently remind my parents they are speaking a language he can&#39;t understand and they will usually apologize and switch back because they hadn&#39;t realized they were doing it. My husband has even asked me if I think he should learn Tamil so he can be included more easily! </p>\n\n<p>And as a side note, it is pretty frustrating to me that I cannot speak Tamil. This happened because I was encouraged to only speak English when I was young, and I lost whatever Tamil I spoke as a little kid. I could learn it again with some formal instruction, maybe, but it still sucks. Please don&#39;t let your husband bully Anya into giving up her first language - she&#39;s still pretty young and could honestly lose a lot of her ability to speak it.</p>\n</div>",

Every household has their own language -- not just geographical dialects but also shared banter and in-jokes.  Every home has their own way to express love.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if Ben, when watching you and Anya speak Hindi, is reminded of the personal \"language\" he shared with his mother.  Other comments have suggested teaching him Hindi, which could help, but can't (and shouldn't) replace the bond he had with his mother.\n\nIt's a terrible situation, but punishing Anya for using Hindi is an asshole move.  Ben's loss does not justify \"weakening\" the bond between you and your daughter.\n\nThis is definitely above the commentariat's paygrade, and something you should bring up with his therapist.  You mentioned that Ben already had his own room prior to his mother's passing.  Perhaps you can reorganize more of the house so he feels more integrated now that he lives with you full time?  Maybe framing some pictures with his mother, or a something personal/sentimental -- when my husband's father passed unexpectedly, we framed their last Christmas card.\n\nIf Ben is open to learning Hindi, I think that's a good step.  I would also suggest finding a new hobby or activity that everyone can explore and share in.  Nothing can replace Ben's mother, but it is always possible to build a \"new\" family.\n\nMy condolences for your stepson's loss.",
