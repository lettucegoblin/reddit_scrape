No. She's not going to get any because her bedroom is a living room.\n\nIf you were being a wonderful, accepting, and trusting host, and she had a space that could be used as a personal area (like perhaps a room that is too small for a bed, but she could go in to work on stuff, etc. I would just say not the asshole because to be fair, you made it clear from the start that the dog was going to be staying in there.

Do you realize how many people have outdoor dogs?\n\nShe and her mother are also assholes because you made it clear how it was going to be, and then they wanted to act surprised when you were serious about it.

Dogs aren't human, they don't need privacy or get their feelings hurt by not having their own room. The important thing is that it is weird she would want to sleep in there if there is nothing to sleep on. If she were to change the room, buy furniture and make it her own, then she is there on at a semi-permanent basis and should pay at least a small rent because she is an adult and not one of your kids. Not to mention that you would then have to cut the nonsense and have a talk with each-other about whether or not you actually want her to live there on a more permanent basis.\n\nYou didn't raise her to be the way she is now so you shouldn't have to deal with her more than you feel like. It is still your house and your house rules and it sounds like a serious talk with her is needed. A curfew would be inappropriate but at least take off shoes when you come in, be quiet at night and do not smoke indoor would be long overdue for her to hear. She clearly lacks common sense. If she can't conform, she can't stay. What your sister have to say to that is inconsequential as Princess and you are both adults having an adult talk about living arrangements. I'd keep your sister out of it as much as you can. You said it yourself, she's a woman.Princess can and should talk for herself.\n\nPersonally I would not have let her in to begin with if my kids were this uncomfortable with her and she hadn't seemed to change her nasty streak or gained redeeming qualities over the years. Your sister is delusional for thinking the presence of her adult daughter is a gift to you. Just how? Does Princess clean the house? Help your kids with homework? Lighten people's mood? Walk the dog? Cook for you? Just how should you be happy to have her?  I don't give a hoot about the animal at the moment. Think about your own kids. It would be crazy to put somebody else in front of your own kids. Especially an adult who can fend for herself.\n\nIf your sister calls to yell at you for having kicked her out there is an easy way out: \"Blame\" your kids.\"I had to ask her to leave. It's the best for my children. She keeps them up at night, distracts them from homework and hurt their feelings. They have a right to feel comfortable in their own home. \" If your sister want's to argue with that then she becomes the A-hole. You do not have to be nice to her.

It sounds like this situation have come about because you are afraid to be the bad guy and be the one to \"start\" drama. Did your sister act controlling towards you when you were children?

        "body": "I don\u2019t know man, this situation kind of happened to my brother and his wife. They\u2019d driven for 9 or so hours to get to my dads house (she was pregnant btw, so not very comfortable to begin with) and once they got there, my dads wife set out a blow up mattresses for them. Which was fine, bc her daughter, who was 24 at the time, was coming in as well, and still had a room set up (my brother and I are 39 and 41, so this relationship happened well after we moved out). Not a big deal, but then around 9 or so, the daughter still hadn\u2019t shown up. So my brother asks about them sleeping in the daughters bedroom, bc, bed. Actually, there were 2 beds, bc there was a twin mattress for her dog. Still told no, bc she still may show up. Now, my brother is a Purple Heart veteran as well as a narcotics officer in the area we live in (Texas). He can sleep on a floor and be a happy camper. The only reason he agreed not to get a hotel room was bc he wanted to let his sons (step son was new to the family and his bio son hadn\u2019t seen our dad in at least a year) be closer to the family and spend as much time as possible with them. Since we both moved, there\u2019s been huge growth in our small town in Mississippi, so there are some fairly nice hotels available. He was kind of pissed bc his wife was pregnant, but she\u2019s as easygoing as they come, so she was fine with whatever. That night, the daughter didn\u2019t show up, again-she decided to stay at her apt a few towns over. Brother was a little peeved, but whatever. Whole next day she still doesn\u2019t show up. That night, they\u2019re waiting on her to come stay in her room and still the same thing ,\u201d she\u2019s coming tonight\u201d. Again, didn\u2019t show. So now, my brother is more than peeved. His wife, who hadn\u2019t really met her new inlaws until this moment, is questioning why they\u2019re placing someone who doesn\u2019t even live at the house over visitors who drove over 9 hours to see them, but again, not going to make a fuss. But for the last two nights, there\u2019s been a big, comfy bed and a twin bed that\u2019s been empty while they\u2019re making do on an air mattress. Brother and I were taught to never raise our voices or show attitude to parents or elders, so that next morning, he politely told them that they would be getting a room nearby because he would not have his wife uncomfortable for one more night (the boys thought it was awesome, like camping!). When they got back home, she asked me if anything like that had happened to me, and of course, yes. I\u2019d gotten divorced about 10 yrs ago and me staying in one of the 2 empty rooms they had was ,\u201d not a good idea, bc it wouldn\u2019t be good for (the daughter) to be around\u201d..... btw, my dad and his wife married 15yrs ago, and she had 3 kids, so she obviously knew what divorce was. Left a bad taste in sister in laws mouth, but we all know better than to stay at their home now. Tbh, I\u2019d have given up my bed for my pregnant sister in law (and this mf\u2019r is a Purple mattress that lifts at the head and feet, AND has massage- it\u2019s unfuckingbelievable how great this damn bed is!!). But, as I told her \u201cthey are who they are and they won\u2019t change now\u201d. You\u2019d think they\u2019d get the daughter to sleep on the couch or whatever, since she didn\u2019t even live there, but nope. This crap happens and let me tell you, being on the receiving end of it sucks; makes you feel so low, like you\u2019re just not important enough to them....",

When guests stay the night they can share with him or take the couch, but that is his room 100%.\n\n**EDIT: quite a few people seem to think this makes me a shitty host/friend/dog owner etc.  So some clarifications:**  *Also, [here are some pictures of him, he is a damn good dog](https://imgur.com/a/mKPwgeM)*\n\nAny family members that stay over love Thor and look forward to cuddling with him, especially my dad. My guy friends that crash are usually doing so after a night of drinking so we all end up crashing on the huge living room sectional couch.  \n\nNo one has actually had an issue with it being \"his room\" and if my wife's parents ever wanted to stay we would gladly give them the room out of respect. They prefer to just gtet an air bnb for everybody's sake and breathing room. Ditto for like say our niece and nephew. If we were to ever have them over for a stay they would be offered the room. It's more \"share the bed with him or sleep on the couch\" when applied to our mutual aged friends (late 20's early 30's) and I end up sleeping out in the living room as we watch let's plays or other you tube shit. It's a huge living room with a comfy ass couch.\n\nAs for the crate training- we did not get Thor as a puppy.  He is a rescue who has had a hard fucking life.  He was born feral (Rhodesian Ridgeback/Malamute cross) tracked by the Albany, NY animal control for 9 months and finally shot by a farmer.  We rescued him and delayed our wedding twice while hiring over 7,000 dollars in dog trainers.  We tried electric collars, muzzles, leads and made great progress, but yeah, we spoil him.  One thing no trainer was ever able to accomplish was getting him to stay in a crate.  We ordered an 1,700 dollar stainless steel crate used for transporting wild animals that he was eventually able to wear down and destroy (lifetime warranty they refunded us in full after we showed photographic evidence).  \n\nso yeah, he is spoiled, no we do not treat our guests like shit, and no it was not just a matter of better training.",

There\u2019s no reason to spoil your children so much that they don\u2019t even know how to be polite when they are a guest and aren\u2019t willing to live on their own. Yes, the cost of living is expensive but it\u2019s doable, you just have to be willing to live without a lot of things you may have been used to.\n\nEDIT: since apparently I\u2019m an asshole and a baby boomer for supposedly suggesting that everyone should move out at the age of 18 let me stop you there. First, thanks to the people who actually read my message and didn\u2019t just assume whatever you thought my thought process was. Second, I apologize if I didn\u2019t make myself clear. \n\nNo, you do not have to move out by 18. It\u2019s what I chose to do because it was cheaper and required less work than staying at my parents house. I also live in a relatively cheap state, although I do live in a very expensive part of that state. Yes, I have a partner, no he does not get to help as much as he would like to thereby making me the only person paying for our expenses. \n\nMy comment was purely a reflection of OPs story. Princess was obviously mooching, and the fact that she is spoiled means that her parents were likely mooching off of the kindness of OP. \n\nI am all for peaceful debate, and for others to not agree with my opinion because adults accept the fact that you wont always be agreed with. But the Flaming wouldn\u2019t be happening if you were face to face with me so why do you feel the need to do so while you\u2019re protected behind a screen? The fact is I am able to live without any parental assistance was a comment completely dependent on my own situation. However you do not know what luxuries I live without in order to live out of my parents house. I was working 2 full time jobs in high school, along with being my sisters primary caretaker and my grandmas hospice attendant (where we lived a family member over the age of 14 could be appointment caretaker). It was cheaper for me to move out as I was paying 700 in rent, paying for electricity and had to buy my own food as well as any school supplies and clothes I needed, as well as for my sisters when they had anything they needed money for like school trips. I was proposed to and moved out immediately after my 18th birthday in order to get out of that life and we petitioned for the custody of my sisters but lost. \n\nI had it harder living at home with bills. This is not the case for 99% of teenagers, and it is okay to live at home until you\u2019re on your feet. But there\u2019s a difference between refusing to get on your feet and not being able to, which is what my comment referred to. So next time, maybe consider the meaning or ask questions before immediately attacking someone for their opinion.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Same, NTA. I\u2019m 21 and have been living on my own since I was 18, with minimal help. There\u2019s no reason to spoil your children so much that they don\u2019t even know how to be polite when they are a guest and aren\u2019t willing to live on their own. Yes, the cost of living is expensive but it\u2019s doable, you just have to be willing to live without a lot of things you may have been used to.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: since apparently I\u2019m an asshole and a baby boomer for supposedly suggesting that everyone should move out at the age of 18 let me stop you there. First, thanks to the people who actually read my message and didn\u2019t just assume whatever you thought my thought process was. Second, I apologize if I didn\u2019t make myself clear. </p>\n\n<p>No, you do not have to move out by 18. It\u2019s what I chose to do because it was cheaper and required less work than staying at my parents house. I also live in a relatively cheap state, although I do live in a very expensive part of that state.
