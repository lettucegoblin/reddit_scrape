And they wonder why it's so hard to retain diverse candidates.  Um yeah, when management doesn't care about the white culture they're fostering, then it's time to go hun.\n\nHaving said that, this sounds like your dream job and it also doesn't sound like you're at the point where you want to leave.  As a Seattleite (yes, actually born here), your passive aggressive tactic is not uncommon.  We here in Seattle are well known for that.  It'll bite ya in the butt though.  White folks here are SUPER DEFENSIVE.  Anything you do that even suggests they might be in the wrong will be blown out of proportion.  So I think you're on the right track, but I think you also need to add some sugar to your spice.\n\nMy tactic, of which I find to be pretty effective, is to play dumb.  And I mean play, cause you and I both know we are not dumb.  But they already think you're dumb (in their subtle racist way), so use it to your advantage.  Here's an example with your Chuck/Tina exchange:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana!\n\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nChuck: Oh my name isn't Chad, it's Chuck.\n\nTina: I am SO SORRY Chuck.  I don't want to disrespect you by calling you by the wrong name.  I'm sure that would get really annoying after a while.  I'm gonna make sure I get it right next time.  So your name is Chuck.  My name is Tina!\n\nChuck: (hopefully) Oh my bad, I totally called you the wrong name too.\n\nAnd then you two fake laugh about it.\n\nThe key here, is to make it personal.  Watch your tone.  Don't be patronizing.  You want to sound ignorant.  Make it sound like you genuinely thought YOU were in the wrong.  Take the time with Chuck to explain how you understand how awful it would be to be named Chuck but to be called Chad (sad tear).  Make it about them, not about you.  And I think this is good enough notice, so if he keeps doing it after you call him out on it personally, then you have every right to stick up for yourself then.  At that point, he is the asshole.\n\nAnd as a general note, I'm with you sis in solidarity.  It's not easy to be the only POC in the office, but it's always worth it to stick up for yourself.  After I left, my old office hired 3 POCs.  I'd like to think it had to do with me telling them off, but who knows.  Best of luck sis.",

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nI moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Blacks and whites were working together in normal, middle class jobs, having normal, teasing conversations together. There are multiplr black TV reporters you see all the time (regular guys, not Halle Berrys). It was eye-opening. Integration was the norm at the working middle class level I was able to get a glimpse of.\n\nThat said, from what little I saw in my short visit, it seemed to only apply to black-white relations. Nashville is FULL of middle easterners who aren't welcomed with open arms. My SIL who lives there said 9/11 was the best thing to happen to black/white relations there, though she might have been kidding.\n\n\nAnyway, it was eye-opening for me and I got just a hint of how suffocating it might be for a black person in the PNW or even in white areas/workplaces of the Bay Area.",
