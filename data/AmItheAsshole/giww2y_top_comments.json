I\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery.

She\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. \n\nSarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\u2019re a physical feature I\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \u2018cartoon boobs\u2019. I know she\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before. \n\nNow we\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\u2019re in a porno. We don\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\u2019t spoken again. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Boys in my school laughed at me for how I would run. They'd snap my bra and laugh as I hurried away. When I was 15 a guy ran up to me, pinned me against a locker at school, groped my chest, and ran off. There was constant taunting and teasing. I got called Jailbait more times than I can count.\n\nAnd then when I got my first job at 16 it didn't stop. My manager would pinch my ass. My second job at 17 was the same thing. It wasn't until I was in college that I found my voice and most of the harassment finally stopped.",

Sarah and her nonsense can hop right into the nearest caldera.</p>\n</div>",
