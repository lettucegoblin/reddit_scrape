Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis happened on Halloween and the day following.\nMy neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. \n\nMy apartment complex didn\u2019t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.\n\nResidents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional \u201cknock on door, physically hand strangers candy\u201d was not permitted.\n\nSo, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn\u2019t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.\n\nThe next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it.

I (26F) also have 2 kids. </p>\n\n<p>My apartment complex didn\u2019t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.</p>\n\n<p>Residents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional \u201cknock on door, physically hand strangers candy\u201d was not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>So, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn\u2019t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well.

But products made with chicken bullion cube were a grey area for us, as I distinctly remember eating chicken Maggi noodles as a kid) \n\nI learnt what gelatin was from a young age, because my friends would eat jelly (jell-o) for snacks and my mum had to explain why I couldn't. I even saw my paternal grandmother making gelatin/aspic from pigs trotters at one stage for an event (my dads side of the family, and my brother ate meat because they have a different faith)\n\nBut we never checked our candy for gelatin. My mum obviously knew, because she wouldn't eat gummy lollies, she would only eat boiled lollies (hard candy) but she never cared what type of candy I ate. \n\nI made homemade Turkish delight with my maternal grandmother, it's just cornstarch and sugar. So I thought that's what all gummy lollies were as a kid.\n\nIt wasn't until I was a teenager and I started learning to read ingredients lists due to allergies (I'd always been allergic to certain foods, but as a kid the reactions were so mild I barely noticed, but after years of exposure the reactions got worse and worse until I eventually experienced anaphylaxis)\n\nI wasn't horrified to learn some lollies contain gelatin, it made perfect sense. I was confused as to why mum never told me. \n\nI asked my mum, and she said it's hard enough for a child to be vegetarian when their friends are enjoying chicken nuggets and freddo in a pond at birthday parties. She explained that gelatin is made from the parts of an animal no one wants, that the meat is already sold and eaten so ethically while it's still a dead animal, at least nothing goes to waste when the gelatin is used, so she wanted to wait until I was old enough to decide how I felt about that. I decided for myself it was unethical, especially in the current mass produced meat industry. \n\nThen I got really sick because of my allergies and some other autoimmune issues, I was in and out of hospital and at one point I was surviving almost entirely on hospital jelly.\n\nSince then I've been vegetarian on and off, every few months I cave and have a meal with meat, my entire family, Aside from my mother, eat meat, all my friends eat meat, and the foods I'm allergic to are found in almost every single pre-made vegetarian product or restaurant item, so as much as I love cooking my own food from scratch at home, sometimes I can't be bothered, and I just want to eat what my partner has cooked for dinner instead of always having to make something separate, or have some starburst for the sweet sweet sugary dopamine.",

My mum obviously knew, because she wouldn&#39;t eat gummy lollies, she would only eat boiled lollies (hard candy) but she never cared what type of candy I ate. </p>\n\n<p>I made homemade Turkish delight with my maternal grandmother, it&#39;s just cornstarch and sugar. So I thought that&#39;s what all gummy lollies were as a kid.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t until I was a teenager and I started learning to read ingredients lists due to allergies (I&#39;d always been allergic to certain foods, but as a kid the reactions were so mild I barely noticed, but after years of exposure the reactions got worse and worse until I eventually experienced anaphylaxis)</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t horrified to learn some lollies contain gelatin, it made perfect sense. I was confused as to why mum never told me. </p>\n\n<p>I asked my mum, and she said it&#39;s hard enough for a child to be vegetarian when their friends are enjoying chicken nuggets and freddo in a pond at birthday parties. She explained that gelatin is made from the parts of an animal no one wants, that the meat is already sold and eaten so ethically while it&#39;s still a dead animal, at least nothing goes to waste when the gelatin is used, so she wanted to wait until I was old enough to decide how I felt about that. I decided for myself it was unethical, especially in the current mass produced meat industry. </p>\n\n<p>Then I got really sick because of my allergies and some other autoimmune issues, I was in and out of hospital and at one point I was surviving almost entirely on hospital jelly.</p>\n\n<p>Since then I&#39;ve been vegetarian on and off, every few months I cave and have a meal with meat, my entire family, Aside from my mother, eat meat, all my friends eat meat, and the foods I&#39;m allergic to are found in almost every single pre-made vegetarian product or restaurant item, so as much as I love cooking my own food from scratch at home, sometimes I can&#39;t be bothered, and I just want to eat what my partner has cooked for dinner instead of always having to make something separate, or have some starburst for the sweet sweet sugary dopamine.</p>\n</div>",

See also colourings now being primarily vegetable based.\n\nI know because it is a) my job and b) I\u2019m massively intolerant to all the seaweed and vegetable replacements and read labels like a hawk. But you and me? We are the dying breed. People are terrifyingly disinterested in food beyond it looking cool for a photo or being tasty. It depresses me that junk food and junk attitudes to food abound even in current veganism but mainstream attitudes to eating. It\u2019s why people are sick from their diets.\n\nAnd don\u2019t start me on how hard it is to find vegan traders doing non junk food in my city unless they are ready cooking it for culture reasons. Whole foods plant based vegan is not fashionable here like everything dripping in fake cheese.\n\nThat said Reddit is HATEFUL about vegans and veganism.

But as a thank and to be nice I had to give some candy to my parents. Any candy I didn't like but my parents did was there's. Their favorites that were also my favorites I would give them some of, but not a large portion. My and my brother would trade for candy we preferred. If my candy just started sitting without me eating it, my parents would help themselves so it doesn't go bad. \n\nI believe my parents arrangement was both reasonable and justifiable. Don't have them take me out trick or treating and they leave empty handed. I often gave them candy without them asking because I liked how we did, not because I was forced to as a tax.

But it also doubled up checking some of our clients knew what a lemon versus a lime was or a carrot versus a parsnip and how to prepare things like a tomato before we tackled things like a plantain or okra.</p>\n\n<p>I mean I grew up in a city in Western Europe in the 80s and 90s where due to poverty some of my peers had never seen a banana in person. I think I was 20 the first time I saw a mango.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people still only see canned fruit and veg especially when living in food poverty but a lot of rich people just never cook. I follow a tonne of cooking and food subs on here and I\u2019ve seen people with degrees and six figures jobs ask how you spread butter on bread.
