Tell hubby the friend that told the truth was a better human than your son in that moment as he realized it wasn't a game to play with a person's livelihood and reputation.  \n\nTime for you and hubby to have a very serious sit down regarding parenting moving forward.  Your son is hitting the age where jokes and pranks aren't as cute & funny - and when the ante is upped to basically setting someone up to take the blame for a crime - it shows they have NO common sense when it comes to boundaries.  And HS is an awful place where he can cross lines, bully, and joke himself into major problems.\n\nBreak this situation down step by step to him:  \n\n* Jeremy had to get the idea, form a plan \n* had to go into my stuff,  take something valuable\n* had to put it in her purse, sneaking into HER private stuff\n* had to declare an emergency and insist I leave work\n* watched me yell, confront and accuse an innocent person...\n\nwhat if the friend had not spoken up?  A person would have lost their job...what if we had called the police? what if she was charged, what if the friends all had lied to keep his secret?  She could have had to spend money to get a lawyer, etc.\n\n(PS - would be a good gesture to call parents of kid that told truth to thank and praise him.  Might be helpful to get positive feedback just in case the other kids are piling on for being honest)",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA - Ask hubby if the friend was lying, then why did Jeremy admit it and say it was a prank?  Tell hubby the friend that told the truth was a better human than your son in that moment as he realized it wasn&#39;t a game to play with a person&#39;s livelihood and reputation.  </p>\n\n<p>Time for you and hubby to have a very serious sit down regarding parenting moving forward.  Your son is hitting the age where jokes and pranks aren&#39;t as cute &amp; funny - and when the ante is upped to basically setting someone up to take the blame for a crime - it shows they have NO common sense when it comes to boundaries.  And HS is an awful place where he can cross lines, bully, and joke himself into major problems.</p>\n\n<p>Break this situation down step by step to him:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jeremy had to get the idea, form a plan </li>\n<li>had to go into my stuff,  take something valuable</li>\n<li>had to put it in her purse, sneaking into HER private stuff</li>\n<li>had to declare an emergency and insist I leave work</li>\n<li>watched me yell, confront and accuse an innocent person...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>what if the friend had not spoken up?  A person would have lost their job...what if we had called the police? what if she was charged, what if the friends all had lied to keep his secret?  She could have had to spend money to get a lawyer, etc.</p>\n\n<p>(PS - would be a good gesture to call parents of kid that told truth to thank and praise him.  Might be helpful to get positive feedback just in case the other kids are piling on for being honest)</p>\n</div>",

This then leads to them becoming adults who think they can do whatever they want without repercussions.\n\nCase in point, my father is an extremely abusive man. He is abusive to every woman that is part of his life, which included his own mother when she was alive. I've heard stories from my father's ex-wife of how my father used to come home drunk during the early stages of their marriage and he would literally throw furniture about and make a complete mess, because he was always an angry drunk. His mother, who lived with them, never reprimanded him or said anything about his behaviour - she simply acted like this was normal and cleaned up the mess her son made. She also stood by and watched her son use and abuse his ex-wife, my mum, and me. \n\nWhat's even worse, is that my father learnt this behaviour from his own father. His father when he was alive, was just as abusive. His mother enabled this abusive behaviour by never taking a stand against her husband or trying to teach her son that what her husband did was wrong.",

In a perfect world, we would like to say that we would know what to do if we were being bullied and I was one of those people. I am now in this crazy position where I can no longer do anything because of how high up these people are and I have to navigate my job the best way I can unless something happens or I find a new job. So yeah, he bullies a few of us and is aggressive, while simultaneously flirting with younger girls and being inappropriate in that way too at the workplace.</p>\n\n<p>People like that rarely ever have to suffer the consequences of their actions because they know how to get away with it, know the right people, and think they are better than everyone else. OP&#39;s son is heading in that direction for sure.</p>\n</div>",
