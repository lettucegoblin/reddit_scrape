Here's the thing, you are allowed to FIRE YOUR CLIENTS. It happens across all industries. I work in consulting for example, and, one client was usually very rude, late to meetings, not being accountable for the project efforts we were assigned to do. One effort was supposed to take a week and we had completed it and were past due for payment, and, the client delayed all that shit by an extra 2 months. After our project wrapped up, we respectfully walked away from the client letting them know we wouldn't be able to work with them anymore. This is your job. If they are not doing the training, showing up and complaining, wasting hours of time on a hike that should take a short amount of time, etc, you have the right to FIRE your client, but, you have to do so respectfully and settle any monetary issues in the process. Hiking can also be dangerous. They sound like they could be a liability and they seemed to lie or over-exaggerate their hiking abilities on the forms you had. Red flag....

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I was going to say YTA because they pre-paid, but, they didn&#39;t follow the training schedule and you REFUNDED their money after the fact. So, I am going to say NTA. Here&#39;s the thing, you are allowed to FIRE YOUR CLIENTS. It happens across all industries. I work in consulting for example, and, one client was usually very rude, late to meetings, not being accountable for the project efforts we were assigned to do. One effort was supposed to take a week and we had completed it and were past due for payment, and, the client delayed all that shit by an extra 2 months. After our project wrapped up, we respectfully walked away from the client letting them know we wouldn&#39;t be able to work with them anymore. This is your job.

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nFirst up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\u2019s obese and had never been on any hike like that before and I\u2019m a little overweight but have been hiking like that for years, neither of us is in great shape but we\u2019re both in (relatively) good health.
