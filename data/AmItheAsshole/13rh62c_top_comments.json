Why would she be a thot? </p>\n\n<p>Having said that:\n- boyfriend and his friends sound like a bunch of judgemental Puritans\n- having dated two guys doesn&#39;t mean having a colourful past. As dating them both doesn&#39;t make her a thot\n- Mike is an idiot for disclosing personal info to his friends without her consent\n- Jessica is an idiot for mocking her over something so stupid as sleeping with two guys who were friends. I still can&#39;t see the issue.\n- Jessica basically called OP a w*. &quot;I wish I was a thot so that I could afford a PS5 too&quot;? Who says that? She&#39;s suggesting that OP slept around for money just because she slept with two guys who were friends? Is she for real?</p>\n\n<p>OP, you are NTA. Mike sure is and a judgemental one at that. Dump him. You deserve someone you can trust and doesn&#39;t have such a childish view of your sexual and romantic life. And also Jessica is. She sounds childish, petty and jealous. Whether she is jelaous of you because she sees you as prettier/funnier/smarter, of your money or of your boyfriend is to be determined. Lose the whole lot of them.</p>\n</div>",
