It's your house, and you have every right to throw anyone out - especially such cruel and horrible people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out \n\nShe shouldn't be an absolute horror towards someone who has done her no wrong, pregnancy doesn't make her magically incapable of experiencing consequences for her actions. \n\nHer pregnancy is not your responsibility, do not feel obligated towards this woman because she's pregnant. She made her bed, and now she can lay in it. \n\nI pity the children she's carrying, she sounds like a horrible person. For the sake of her unborn babies I can only hope she's kinder to them than she was to your sister.",

All because my stepson made him angry one day because he got in trouble at school for something petty.\n\nFor some context, they were newly married, he was 19, and she had quit taking her birth control without telling him, gotten pregnant, and didn't even tell him she was pregnant until she was 5-6 months along. He was obviously freaked out when she told him (though she didn't tell him at that point how far along she was) and he told her he didn't want a kid. He regrets having said that now, but at the time he was young and scared and angry she had trapped him into it the way that she did.\n\nObviously, this has given him quite a complex, even after having been told the whole story, compounded by the fact that he's on the autism spectrum and struggles with self esteem and self worth as it is, which his grandfather knew when he said it to him. It just takes one hell of a special kind of asshole to say shit like that to children.",

He told my stepson (13 at the time) that his dad had wanted his mom.to get an abortion when he found out she was pregnant with him. All because my stepson made him angry one day because he got in trouble at school for something petty.</p>\n\n<p>For some context, they were newly married, he was 19, and she had quit taking her birth control without telling him, gotten pregnant, and didn&#39;t even tell him she was pregnant until she was 5-6 months along. He was obviously freaked out when she told him (though she didn&#39;t tell him at that point how far along she was) and he told her he didn&#39;t want a kid. He regrets having said that now, but at the time he was young and scared and angry she had trapped him into it the way that she did.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this has given him quite a complex, even after having been told the whole story, compounded by the fact that he&#39;s on the autism spectrum and struggles with self esteem and self worth as it is, which his grandfather knew when he said it to him. It just takes one hell of a special kind of asshole to say shit like that to children.</p>\n</div>",
