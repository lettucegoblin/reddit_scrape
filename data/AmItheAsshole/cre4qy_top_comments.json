Look, your grandmother, even if misguided, believes that you are making yourself look less attractive/hurting your job opportunities/limiting your romantic options or whatever else thing pops into her old grandma mind.  Because in her day it did.\n\nIt wasn't *that* long ago that any job (at least in their minds) that wasn't a fast food jockey or a carney didn't allow piercings except for single ear piercings on women, and no visible tattoos.  Even fast food workers used to have to wear sleeves or bandages to cover tattoos and take out any non-ear piercings.\n\nIf you wanted to be respectable at all you either didn't get tattoos or piercings, or you got them in areas that were not visible unless you were wearing a bikini.  So Gam-Gam *thinks* that she's trying to show you the knowledge of your elders.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have every right to not be put down every time you see her.  You ignored it.

You only said something once but responded as though she's gone against your will \"a million times\". \n\n2. What she said MIGHT not be intended as an insult. But you 100% wanted to hurt her.\n\nShe's not so much insulting you directly, is she? She's insulting a type of jewelry that you like...while also round-about complimenting you. She is making the bull comparison, I will admit. And you're not wrong to be hurt by that. But I think maybe she only saw herself as attacking the ring she doesn't like. She wasn't necessarily *trying* to hurt you... maybe she just has misguided/dated ideas of fashion/advice? Definitely over-stepping boundaries, but possibly as a misguided attempt at helping you. I wouldn't attribute to malice... could easily be stupidity.\n\nDo you have to like that? Nope. Not at all. But that would be a good reason to say something before you've built up a powder keg of resentment and are one spark from blowing up. Which you've addressed:\n\n>because I\u2019m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself.\n\nThat's perfectly fine to be non-confrontational. If you couldn't bring yourself to say something that's okay. Sometimes I find myself in a situation where I've built up resentment due to not saying something too. But I've learned to remind myself that my choice not to confront... is also my choice to have someone not fully understand the situation. That's on me. I don't get a free pass to suddenly be mean under the defense of \"You don't know how long this has been pissing me off!\" because *I am* the reason they don't know I'm about to blow up. They don't know I've been secretly hating this all the times I didn't speak up. It's a personal choice that comes with a fair cost. If I eventually choose to speak up for the first time, I have to treat it like we're at square one. Because we are. I xan be mad, but only as much as is warranted for... a first offense.\n\nANECDOTE:\n\nIn high school I kinda sorta nicknamed a good friend \"Druggy Paul\" because he... talked about drugs a lot lol. And excitedly! I didn't call him that all the time, but I would sometimes greet him that way (cheerfully!) After several months, one day he calmly told me \"Hey I don't really like you calling me that.\" And I laughed it off and apologized, fully intent on never calling him that again...\n\nHabits die hard sometimes. I didn't see this dude everyday, and genuinely liked him... I'd get excited and say the same thing! I did it two more times before he finally actually acted really annoyed with me, at which point I felt bad, got it, and never did it again.\n\nBut he didn't flip out on me for doing that a hundred times, and I really considered him a great person for that. It wasn't lost on me.\n\nAlternatively, there have been at least a dozen times in my life where someone freaked out on me for something that they had warned me about exactly once... but I had done it \"a million times\" and they were now acting as such\n\nTLDR: I kinda think when you jump to trying to hurt someone... you're being an asshole.",

If I eventually choose to speak up for the first time, I have to treat it like we&#39;re at square one. Because we are. I xan be mad, but only as much as is warranted for... a first offense.</p>\n\n<p>ANECDOTE:</p>\n\n<p>In high school I kinda sorta nicknamed a good friend &quot;Druggy Paul&quot; because he... talked about drugs a lot lol. And excitedly! I didn&#39;t call him that all the time, but I would sometimes greet him that way (cheerfully!) After several months, one day he calmly told me &quot;Hey I don&#39;t really like you calling me that.&quot; And I laughed it off and apologized, fully intent on never calling him that again...</p>\n\n<p>Habits die hard sometimes. I didn&#39;t see this dude everyday, and genuinely liked him... I&#39;d get excited and say the same thing! I did it two more times before he finally actually acted really annoyed with me, at which point I felt bad, got it, and never did it again.</p>\n\n<p>But he didn&#39;t flip out on me for doing that a hundred times, and I really considered him a great person for that. It wasn&#39;t lost on me.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, there have been at least a dozen times in my life where someone freaked out on me for something that they had warned me about exactly once... but I had done it &quot;a million times&quot; and they were now acting as such</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: I kinda think when you jump to trying to hurt someone... you&#39;re being an asshole.</p>\n</div>",

Maybe you\u2019ll get some new synapses firing and become a bit less of an asshole.</p>\n</div>",

PAY ATTENTION AND SAY SORRY\u201d I didn\u2019t no what to do, luckily I was with my dad and he said to her that I said sorry and that she is the one who had to pay attention. Then my dad told me what had happened because he was behind me and I realized it wasn\u2019t my fault. Sadly this kind of behavior is really common \u2639\ufe0f</p>\n</div>",

I fell into an odd cusp-generation area - growing up, NO adult believed you over any other adult anywhere ever, and in trouble meant picking your own switch, or getting whipped with the vacuum cleaner cord for often some pretty minor infractions, so now when I'm out in public and see a lot of outrageous behaviors - and i mean from 6 year olds right up to 15 yr olds, 22 year olds getting taken out to lunch by their folks talking to them like their complete fucking idiots right in their faces, loudly ... And zero repercussions?  I will have to admit that these sort of scenarios make me feel a certain way .. like a lost sense of Justice and that I feel like my upbringing was harsher due to what was and was not being accepted widely, and the younger generations since have had it easier, so I suppose there's something related to resentment in there, maybe? Which sucks and I'm not proud of that, but I don't go out of my way to be a dick just because I've got 20+ years on someone I'm interacting with.  Trust me, I never thought I would be remotely one if those \"Damned kids these days\" guys, but as I get older ... Well, it actually does come down to respect, as you say.  The older I get, I have my experiences, right? They're to have and use to help me relate to other people, so as I said I was born in between generations that had labels and got a Mish mash of values from different places.  I didn't grow up rich, but we were never so worried that I considered the military, looking back, I was definitely what I'd consider spoiled, but I got my beat downs when I fucked up bad enough too, and I paid for all my own shit as I got older, worked as a dishwasher at 15yrs old for  something like $3.45 an hour to buy a car off a relative and put gas in it myself, and yadda yadda so on and so forth, all the typical stuff to follow that makes me feel like I'm getting old, BUT, this means that when I'm out in public and bump into a 23 year old that sweet talked his folks into letting him be homeschooled at 15 so he could chill out all day and play online with his buddies, and either hasn't ever had a job or works for his parents and has never had any other job, was raised being told that the phrase \"shut up\" was too harsh and hurtful, let alone being physically touched when his behavior needed correcting - I have a lot of trouble relating to that guy or understanding where he's coming from, and it's very easy for my brain to try and disqualify him as not *earning* the right to an opinion on much ... He'll most certainly *have* opinions, on a lot of things, and loud, but I can't help feeling that  there's a disconnect on that and his right to express them to me, really.  And that's the sort of automatic overgeneralization and poor attitude that will keep me from being happy overall in life, so I'm trying to ditch them, but it's hard.  So next time a crabby old person snaps at you or is snarky or something (not OPs situation at all, here, btw - I mean in general) they may be just as surprised that they let something fly out of their mouth as you are.  I'm working on fixing my bad attitude, is what I'm trying to say.  Sorry for the novel!\nTL;DR-As someone who feels like I'm turning into the rude old person, at least in my case, the initial disdain / lack of respect thing is not intentional, it feels like it sneaks up on you over a long period of time, and before you realize, it, you can't seem to divert it elsewhere very easily.",
