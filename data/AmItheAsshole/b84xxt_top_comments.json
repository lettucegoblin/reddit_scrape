Cornell engineering is extremely prestigious and very difficult to get into. It's the top tier ivy league engineering school. Your sister should not take it as a slight against her at all, and I absolutely understand why she was upset not to get it. Cornell is ranked up there with MIT, Michigan, Cal Tech, and Stanford.\n\nHowever:\n\n> I\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\u2019re best friends and I just don\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\n\nYou *absolutely* deserve this. *Never think that you don't.*\n\nIf you end up going to Cornell, you'll have to do your sister proud because you'll have to succeed there where she can't. It will be very difficult for you, too. I skated by during high school, too, and college was *really* difficult. Not the material; that was easy. What was difficult was getting myself to put in the time to do the work. Also, while you'll meet the smartest people you've ever met while you're at school, you'll also meet people so *stupid* that you'll wonder how they get out of bed in the morning. Success at school is only a little bit due to intelligence, and much more due to your willingness to show up to class, spend the time on studying, and put in the time required to succeed!\n\nYes, you will drift apart from your sister somewhat. There's nothing that would stop that. Some day you were always going to get jobs in different companies and you wouldn't see each other every day anymore. You'll have your own families. That was always going to happen. However, you'll always be close. You will always have each other. You'll keep up with each other through phone calls and social media. It will suck and you'll miss her, but she's always going to be in your life and you in hers.  \n\nAt the end of the day: you need to start thinking of what is best for *you*. You're going to be an adult. You need to make decisions that will put you in the best position to succeed for your life. The shittiest part of being an adult is making yourself do what is best instead of doing what you want. It never stops being important and it never stops sucking.\n\n> I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n\nYou have a really great sister! And she's entirely right.\n\nYour parents need to step back and think about what they said.\n",

I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish?

I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school?

We\u2019re such different people, which I\u2019m sure you get. My sister is a big social butterfly and has a million friends.

I ended up going to the school I got accepted to simply on the basis that my sister would never forgive me or herself if she thought that I went to my second choice school because of her. Sometimes that kind of sympathy can do more harm than it can do good. Much love to you and your sister! \n\n",

There are so many things to consider, but going to Cornell just because it's Cornell is a pretty lame reason. What would make you happiest? I assure you, after graduation, no one gives a flying fuck what school you went to.\n\nHave you gone on visits to either/both campuses yet? Make sure you do. Campus life should be a major factor in deciding. What about extra-curriculars, groups, clubs, night life, Greek life, rooming options, the surrounding cities themselves? What does each school offer that you might be interested in? College is an EXPERIENCE, and so much more than a degree. You can get an amazing education anywhere, and turn that into a job anywhere.\n\nDon't make the decision based on your parents (oof), your sister, or any of the other commenters here saying you will regret the rest of your life if you don't go to the \"better\" school. I got into multiple schools I applied to. Some were \"better\" than the school I went to. I went where I WANTED to go most, and I don't regret it at all. You do you.\n\nOf course, you and your sister seem to have a wonderful relationship. You two will only drift apart if you let yourselves. If you know in your heart that you will have a better time being closer in proximity to your sister, then go to NYU. To hell with all these people saying to spread your wings and live your own life. For me, family is the most important thing in my life. I am an individual, and I love my family. I went to school where I did, largely because of how close I would be to my family. That was important to me. How important is it to you?\n\nOne final piece of advice to look at that I haven't seen mentioned yet, don't overlook your financial situation and how different it may be depending on where you go. I don't know the difference in tuition and living costs between Cornell and NYU, but money is sadly a larger factor than it should be in a perfect world. How much debt you graduate with is significant. The last thing you or your family should want for you is to get thrown out into the big-wide world after 4 years, just to be crushed by debt. See what scholarships you may be eligible for at each school, check into other financial aid options as well. Again, the name of the school on your piece of paper at the end of everything is really not all that important in the larger scope of things. \n\nYour quality of life during your education, and plan for afterwards is what matters. You have a lot of time to figure out what to do with the rest of your life. Do what will make you happiest. Do not rush into anything. \n\nYou are smart and you earned every opportunity you have here. Don't worry about your sister or your parents too much. This decision is yours. Congratulations!

Trust me that someday she will have a wonderful fabulous something happen.  And it won\u2019t have happened to you.  And it will be okay.  You will be so happy for her.  And you will understand that there is always something other people have that you don\u2019t.  And things you have that others don\u2019t.  And you gotta still keep moving forward in your own life at your own speed on your own path.  Other people\u2019s ups and downs don\u2019t disturb that path any more than your ups and downs should disturb there\u2019s.  Go have an amazing time at Cornell and prove to yourself that you did indeed well earn that position. And your sister will find her own path with her own successes (and failures) like we all do.

But, I think everyone just needs to digest all this information a bit before any more big talks and raw emotions. \nThat being said I\u2019m gonna tell you something that you haven\u2019t heard in a while because you\u2019ve been fed the opposite information for the last few years as you worked toward collage admissions.  Life is not a fucking contest.  Your good fortune doesn\u2019t make someone else a loser.  And your achievements don\u2019t diminish others or make you better.  If you want to go to Cornell then do so.  Period.  I think it may be high time you had experiences and adventures without your twin.  And she needs that too.  Trust me that someday she will have a wonderful fabulous something happen.  And it won\u2019t have happened to you.  And it will be okay.  You will be so happy for her.  And you will understand that there is always something other people have that you don\u2019t.  And things you have that others don\u2019t.  And you gotta still keep moving forward in your own life at your own speed on your own path.  Other people\u2019s ups and downs don\u2019t disturb that path any more than your ups and downs should disturb there\u2019s.  Go have an amazing time at Cornell and prove to yourself that you did indeed well earn that position. And your sister will find her own path with her own successes (and failures) like we all do.  Congratulations!</p>\n</div>",

But I know how hard it can be to be apart from your sister when you share a bond like that. You're not going to be that far apart though! It's going to be a new and exciting and very lonely place when you get there and you will rely on each other a lot. I don't think you will drift apart that much.

All of this, after we separated...

I'm currently a freshman in college, and my life was pretty similar in terms of somewhat laziness during high school but still getting a good GPA because grade inflation, though I ended up being the twin to go into the college of engineering at my university, where my sister went to a different school in a \"softer\" major.\n\nAfter reading your updates, I'm stunned by how your parents reacted. I don't think you realize how much your parents' and your own language around your intelligence are affecting you. You seem pretty damn smart to me, and clearly NYU and Cornell see that in you, too. Just because you're more interested in arts than your sister or because you got a lower ACT really does NOT indicate how intelligent you are. AT ALL. And I say that as the twin that got a higher SAT. My sister is smarter than me in many, many ways, and she's proving it now in college!\n\nAbout your schools-- NYU and Cornell are both really great options for you! As a fellow twin, I will tell you that there isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss my sister at some point, and that feeling isn't really going away. Twin seperation anxiety? VERY real! And the weekends that we manage to visit each other are absolutely AWFUL when they end. I cry a bit every time one of us has to leave.\n\nThat being said, I don't regret going to a different school, and neither does my sister. I never dated in high school and I probably wouldn't have started in freshman year of college if my twin went to the same school as me, and now I'm in an incredible relationship! I've made a lot of very different friends, and that really wouldn't have happened as nicely if I didn't end up going to a different school.\n\nYou have a really tough decision ahead of you. No matter what you do, you're going to be wondering about the what-ifs. Ultimately, what my sister and I did was we went to the school that we thought would make us happiest, and those schools ended up being different.\n\nIt seems to me, there's no wrong choice here. It may feel like this decision is absolutely huge and life changing, and yes, it is, but college is college anywhere. Go to the school that gives you a better feeling.\n\nGood luck!!",

As long as you work hard wherever you are and build the right relationships than you will earn your degree and be successful in your field. Sure a name looks good on paper, but in the real world no one cares where you went to school. A degree that cost you 5k is the same degree that cost you 500k.  And to top it off, the other schools you mentioned are also great schools. So I think you'll be fine whenever you go. Its just a matter if you want to be with your sister or not. ",

What they are looking for varies significantly by which academic college you apply to within the university.\n\nThis is not to say it is or isn't the right choice for you. You may be every bit as smart as your sister but if you are not super academically driven  (which I gather by you saying you took a less pressure course load and studied between classes) going to a highly competitive school might not be the right choice.

HR is the ones sorting through resumes, not the engineering department, and HR wouldn\u2019t know a top tier school from a hole in the ground.  They sort by GPA, relative density of coursework be damned.  It actually made my first couple job searches really hard, since almost nobody at my alma mater was pulling a 3.5 or better.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I graduated thanks to a mix of hard work, luck, and pity and not in that order, and my GPA was not great.  But I know I\u2019ve forgotten more in that crucible of coursework than some schools even begin to teach.  And it\u2019s certainly helped in the jobs afterwards to be able to know those things.  But when you\u2019re in college going to job fairs, the only thing keeping your resume out of circular filing is the GPA number.  And you\u2019ll have a bette time of that at an easier school.

HR is the ones sorting through resumes, not the engineering department, and HR wouldn\u2019t know a top tier school from a hole in the ground.  They sort by GPA, relative density of coursework be damned.  It actually made my first couple job searches really hard, since almost nobody at my alma mater was pulling a 3.5 or better.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I graduated thanks to a mix of hard work, luck, and pity and not in that order, and my GPA was not great.  But I know I\u2019ve forgotten more in that crucible of coursework than some schools even begin to teach.  And it\u2019s certainly helped in the jobs afterwards to be able to know those things.  But when you\u2019re in college going to job fairs, the only thing keeping your resume out of circular filing is the GPA number.  And you\u2019ll have a bette time of that at an easier school.

Instead of specialized/targeted study, if you are majoring in one thing but decide to apply to jobs in a totally unrelated subject, then the general prestige of your school does matter a lot (this is why art history majors from Princeton still routinely get management consulting or analyst jobs at top firms, but you'll rarely see that with non-elite schools).\n\nOn the other hand, if you are applying to the field you actually train for as a student, I think overall school prestige matters much less than the strength and reputation of your specific program according to insiders. So for example business, law, and anything in the arts is definitely more prestigious coming from NYU than Cornell. Idk if OP mentioned what she will actually major in, but should be an important consideration. Also if the goal is to work in NYC, being able to network and work internships in NYC is an incredibly valuable opportunity IMO.",

PLEASE don't pick one because you think you \"deserve\" less. You deserve both. And don't pick one to make your sister feel better. That would be selling yourself short and patronizing her. If you really, truly want to go to college with her, that's okay to consider, but also consider that you will likely need to pursue different careers and may end up living in different places -- this might be a good time to develop some independence.\n\nGood luck, and remember: both of these schools are excellent choices. The only way you can go wrong here is by choosing a school to comfort her or punish yourself, instead of choosing a school to give yourself the best college experience and academic opportunities possible.\n\nEdit: One last thing to consider is that a LOT of people feel that they aren't good enough. I went to a prestigious liberal arts college and was surrounded by a lot of smart people, but a consistent part of the freshmen orientation process was about convincing us that no one is the \"admissions mistake.\"  Lots and lots of very smart students feel the same way you do.",

College admissions are emotional rollercoasters and it takes a while to get over if they're disappointing. That said, you should go to the university that you really want to, on your terms. You and your sister will remain close no matter where you go, and don't forget that even if you went to the same uni, there's a good chance you'd see very little of each other given the different schools. I'm speaking from experience here. Me and my younger sister went to the same university, and we barely ever saw each other.\n\nDon't let your parents get to you, and don't let anyone tell you that you didn't deserve to get in. It sounds like your parents have some sort of \"STEM good, Arts bad\" thing going on (I hope they aren't south Asian, it's endemic among us) but do not let this get to you. You're obviously a very bright and caring person and don't let anyone ever talk you into believing you are stupid.\n\nTotal shot in the dark here, but the way you've written, it seems to me that a large part of you does wanna go to Cornell. I say go for it. I'm sure your sister will understand and if you've been together all your lives, spending time on your own will be good growth for both of you. College is a very exciting time and I hope you have lots of fun.\n\nOh and congrats once again on getting into Cornell.",

You don't have to take them that year, but you almost always have to take certain 100-levels in a given subject to be able to take a 200 level, some 200s to take a 300, and so on.\n\nWithin those levels are classes that have a somewhat progression, so you take 101 before 102. Each uni and often each department does things a bit differently within those levels though, its more of a rough organization.
