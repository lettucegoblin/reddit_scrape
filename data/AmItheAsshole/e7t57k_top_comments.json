Before you have kids you think it seems so easy. Everyone tells you \"life changes\" or \"no more sleep\" or \"it's the hardest job in the world\" and you think \"yeah yeah yeah, I'll be fine\". Then you have the first and it's hard but doable. Then along comes the second. And that's where the rot sets in. It's not about love. Crikey, there's tons of love. No, It's about patience. You get love hormones after having kids, but you don't get patience hormones and TBH patience is infinitely more important. You have just about enough patience to cope with having to look after a tiny human coupled with sleep deprivation not knowing what you should be doing,  but chuck in another  kid and a job and sleep deprivation and housework and the shift from normal working hours to being on call 24/7 365 days per year  and a relationship and the maintenance involved with that, well, it's hard. Really hard.  Patience is stretched paper thin when dealing with the kids and the job because nobody catches a break,  so there's no patience or time left for a relationship. I'm lucky with my husband in as much as we were together 20 years before we had kids so we know it's something we just have to work through and we are able to be honest about our feelings on this situation. He doesn't regret them and thinks it's the greatest thing he has ever done. I don't regret them, but I wouldn't have kids if I could do it again. You should be able to talk about your feelings in a safe space. You are definitely NTA and your wife absolutely is for betraying your trust and attempting to destroy your relationship with your child.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. I&#39;m an older mum to a 10-year-old and a seven-year-old. I love my boys to bits. But if I had the chance for a do-over, I wouldn&#39;t have kids. Before you have kids you think it seems so easy. Everyone tells you &quot;life changes&quot; or &quot;no more sleep&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s the hardest job in the world&quot; and you think &quot;yeah yeah yeah, I&#39;ll be fine&quot;. Then you have the first and it&#39;s hard but doable. Then along comes the second. And that&#39;s where the rot sets in. It&#39;s not about love. Crikey, there&#39;s tons of love. No, It&#39;s about patience. You get love hormones after having kids, but you don&#39;t get patience hormones and TBH patience is infinitely more important. You have just about enough patience to cope with having to look after a tiny human coupled with sleep deprivation not knowing what you should be doing,  but chuck in another  kid and a job and sleep deprivation and housework and the shift from normal working hours to being on call 24/7 365 days per year  and a relationship and the maintenance involved with that, well, it&#39;s hard. Really hard.  Patience is stretched paper thin when dealing with the kids and the job because nobody catches a break,  so there&#39;s no patience or time left for a relationship. I&#39;m lucky with my husband in as much as we were together 20 years before we had kids so we know it&#39;s something we just have to work through and we are able to be honest about our feelings on this situation. He doesn&#39;t regret them and thinks it&#39;s the greatest thing he has ever done. I don&#39;t regret them, but I wouldn&#39;t have kids if I could do it again. You should be able to talk about your feelings in a safe space. You are definitely NTA and your wife absolutely is for betraying your trust and attempting to destroy your relationship with your child.</p>\n</div>",

You call the four-year old child a \u2018nightmare\u2019, but I\u2019m telling you: this was the risk you took on when you chose to have children. It isn\u2019t the kids\u2019 fault that you weren\u2019t prepared to take on that risk, and it really, really pisses me off to hear people on here talking about \u2018command z-ing\u2019 their disabled children.

I\u2019m not going to tell you that it\u2019s somehow OK to talk about your child as if he\u2019s not even a person because he makes your life harder. \n\nYour wife: telling your kids that was nothing short of emotional abuse. God, how awful. And what\u2019s even worse is, she\u2019s not wrong. So not only did she say a horrible, unforgivable thing, she can\u2019t really take it back. She told a horrible, ugly truth that she never should have told in a way designed to hurt your kids. \n\nYou wanna know who deserves sympathy here? It isn\u2019t you, with your resentment palpable even through the screen that I have no doubt your kids can see. It isn\u2019t your wife, who\u2019s basically just traumatized your kids for life.

If there are already problems in a marriage, even if they seem small, kids will MAGNIFY them, not solve or cause them. If there are problems with your character (lack of patience, lack of selflessness, lack of moral fiber, lack of empathy, etc), kids will MAGNIFY them, not cause or fix them.\n\nIf you were selfish before kids (and it seems like you probably were), then having kids will just make that MORE apparent to you and everyone in your family. Your kids didn\u2019t make you selfish, they just made it more evident. \n\nIf you lacked patience before kids, then you having kids (especially a special needs kid), then that problem is just made that more evident. \n\nYour marriage almost CERTAINLY had problems before having kids (no marriage is perfect!) and having kids will just make them more obvious, no create them.\n\nKids are ALWAYS innocent. Kids DO NOT CAUSE ADULT PROBLEMS. Adults are responsible for seeing what is problematic, both in their relationships and with themselves, and working on those problems. It is not fair or even true to say, \u201cKids ruined my relationship.\u201d No they didn\u2019t. Adults neglecting their marriage, not working on their own issues, and not working on things like adults ruined their marriage. Kids don\u2019t ruin adult sex lives - adults not making their sex lives and marriage a priority ruined their sex lives. \n\nIf your marriage sucks, that\u2019s on you. If you lack patience and aren\u2019t working on gaining any, that\u2019s on you. If you resent your kids ruining your single guy good time, that\u2019s on you.

If there are problems with your character (lack of patience, lack of selflessness, lack of moral fiber, lack of empathy, etc), kids will MAGNIFY them, not cause or fix them.</p>\n\n<p>If you were selfish before kids (and it seems like you probably were), then having kids will just make that MORE apparent to you and everyone in your family. Your kids didn\u2019t make you selfish, they just made it more evident. </p>\n\n<p>If you lacked patience before kids, then you having kids (especially a special needs kid), then that problem is just made that more evident. </p>\n\n<p>Your marriage almost CERTAINLY had problems before having kids (no marriage is perfect!) and having kids will just make them more obvious, no create them.</p>\n\n<p>Kids are ALWAYS innocent. Kids DO NOT CAUSE ADULT PROBLEMS. Adults are responsible for seeing what is problematic, both in their relationships and with themselves, and working on those problems. It is not fair or even true to say, \u201cKids ruined my relationship.\u201d No they didn\u2019t. Adults neglecting their marriage, not working on their own issues, and not working on things like adults ruined their marriage. Kids don\u2019t ruin adult sex lives - adults not making their sex lives and marriage a priority ruined their sex lives. </p>\n\n<p>If your marriage sucks, that\u2019s on you. If you lack patience and aren\u2019t working on gaining any, that\u2019s on you. If you resent your kids ruining your single guy good time, that\u2019s on you. Grow up and get to work or do the easy thing and walk. It happens all the time. But stop blaming your kids for your crappy life and outlook.</p>\n\n<p>ESH.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Throwaway Account \n\nNTA - You did not say it to your kids, and your wife is a horrible person for telling them.\n\nI can't say I regret him, no way; I am crazy about him. We have an incredible relationship and he's not the typical shit-head teen (yet). He's a great kid, we have the same sense of humor, he respects me, and we are so close. But sometimes I wonder how my life would be if I never met his Dad and I could use my income to do things like travel, actually have time for a social circle, return to university and get a degree in neuroscience, and not just live my day with gym, work, cook dinner, clean up, rinse and repeat \u2014 day after day. \n\nI am a single parent after my son's father was in a car accident when he was barely four months old. He suffered a TBI and was in a coma, then the brain injury unit, then lived in a brain injury facility, then had out-patient care for months. He became a horrible parent who was terrible to my son, used his injury as an excuse to not even do simple tasks like washing a dish (of which he was competent), and sponged off of me. It was like having a toddler and a teenager. After 3 years, I couldn't take it anymore, I divorced him, and he now lives in a different state. Which frankly, is a blessing. I'd rather be a sole parent than a co-parent. His entire family is toxic and horrible to be around.\n\nMy son is now 14, and I've been single ever since barring one long-term relationship that didn't work out. He has ADHD and severe depression with suicidal ideation and has engaged in self-harm, so I always worry about him. Being the only one who emotionally and financially supports my son, all the appointments, errands, cooking healthy meals daily, chores, and just making sure all of our needs are met can be so tiring and occasionally overwhelming. Day in and day out of everywhere I go, someone wanting something from me and my son isn't even high maintenance. \n\nMy son doesn't really have a relationship with his Dad because his Dad is emotionally abusive and doesn't have the tools to be a decent parent. My family lives two states away, and even if they lived nearby, they would be practically useless as they aren't the involved type. I have a great career in tech and have flexible hours and work for a great company, but it can be demanding work. I'm an introvert, so I tend to be a homebody when I have some downtime and as a consequence, I don't have a social circle or a support network. \n\nAnd I know this is so vain, but ten years ago when I was in my early 30s I looked like I was 25. I've put on weight despite trying to eat healthy and go to the gym as often as possible. Another bonus is I'm starting to show my age. Not to mention the stigma against single mothers and people who believe we are just vampires looking for someone to nail down and saddle with our problems. I gave up on trying to date a couple years ago, not worth the effort.\n\nBut enough whining, it felt good to get that out. Suck it up buttercup! It certainly could be a lot worse.\n\ntd;dr NTA, parenting is hard, I don't regret my child but can get overwhelmed and sometimes wonder what life would be like if it were different.",

But sometimes I wonder how my life would be if I never met his Dad and I could use my income to do things like travel, actually have time for a social circle, return to university and get a degree in neuroscience, and not just live my day with gym, work, cook dinner, clean up, rinse and repeat \u2014 day after day. </p>\n\n<p>I am a single parent after my son&#39;s father was in a car accident when he was barely four months old. He suffered a TBI and was in a coma, then the brain injury unit, then lived in a brain injury facility, then had out-patient care for months. He became a horrible parent who was terrible to my son, used his injury as an excuse to not even do simple tasks like washing a dish (of which he was competent), and sponged off of me. It was like having a toddler and a teenager. After 3 years, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, I divorced him, and he now lives in a different state. Which frankly, is a blessing. I&#39;d rather be a sole parent than a co-parent. His entire family is toxic and horrible to be around.</p>\n\n<p>My son is now 14, and I&#39;ve been single ever since barring one long-term relationship that didn&#39;t work out. He has ADHD and severe depression with suicidal ideation and has engaged in self-harm, so I always worry about him. Being the only one who emotionally and financially supports my son, all the appointments, errands, cooking healthy meals daily, chores, and just making sure all of our needs are met can be so tiring and occasionally overwhelming. Day in and day out of everywhere I go, someone wanting something from me and my son isn&#39;t even high maintenance. </p>\n\n<p>My son doesn&#39;t really have a relationship with his Dad because his Dad is emotionally abusive and doesn&#39;t have the tools to be a decent parent. My family lives two states away, and even if they lived nearby, they would be practically useless as they aren&#39;t the involved type. I have a great career in tech and have flexible hours and work for a great company, but it can be demanding work. I&#39;m an introvert, so I tend to be a homebody when I have some downtime and as a consequence, I don&#39;t have a social circle or a support network. </p>\n\n<p>And I know this is so vain, but ten years ago when I was in my early 30s I looked like I was 25. I&#39;ve put on weight despite trying to eat healthy and go to the gym as often as possible. Another bonus is I&#39;m starting to show my age. Not to mention the stigma against single mothers and people who believe we are just vampires looking for someone to nail down and saddle with our problems. I gave up on trying to date a couple years ago, not worth the effort.</p>\n\n<p>But enough whining, it felt good to get that out. Suck it up buttercup! It certainly could be a lot worse.</p>\n\n<p>td;dr NTA, parenting is hard, I don&#39;t regret my child but can get overwhelmed and sometimes wonder what life would be like if it were different.</p>\n</div>",

I have never changed my mind. \n\nPeople ask me about it. A lot. It\u2019s been happening for years. I\u2019ve always been honest about how I feel. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like kids, it\u2019s just not what I want out of my life. Usually I\u2019m told that I just don\u2019t understand, or that I\u2019m too young and that\u2019s why I feel this way, I\u2019m assure that I\u2019ll change my mind when I\u2019m more mature. Your basic \u201cI know better that you\u201d massively insulting and unacceptable response. \n\nLately though? Lately I\u2019ve noticed a shift. I still get the \u201cyou\u2019ll change your mind\u201d bullshit but more and more I\u2019m getting another response. It\u2019s coming from women who have kids. Women who are also in their 30s. Maybe are women I don\u2019t even know that well. Their response? Some version of \u201cGood for you, I wish I hadn\u2019t\u201d. \n\nThe first few times it caught me off guard. That\u2019s not something you expect to hear from a mother. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it at first. Now though? It\u2019s happened enough times that I\u2019ve had tome to think about those responses and I\u2019ve come to understand and feel for this women. They\u2019re saying something they aren\u2019t supposed to say. They\u2019re expressing feelings they aren\u2019t supposed to have. They're doing it to me because they\u2019ve identified me as someone who might understand them, that it might be safe to share this with me, **because it isn\u2019t safe for them to share these feelings**. Because they aren\u2019t supposed to feel that way. It\u2019s the same reason you\u2019ve used a throwaway. \n\nBecause it isn\u2019t safe. \n\nBecause people wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not okay for mothers to feel that way. \n\nBut more and more, I think it is how a lot of people feel. It is normal It is okay. It should be safe. Feeling like maybe this isn\u2019t the life that you wanted doesn't mean you love your children any less. It doesnt mean you\u2019re a bad person or an unloving mother. It means you\u2019re a human who\u2019s wondering what life would be like if you\u2019d chosen differently. \n\nI just wanted to share that for anyone who needed to hear it. I don\u2019t think OP is the asshole, I think a lot more people agree with him than would even admit it.",

Your basic \u201cI know better that you\u201d massively insulting and unacceptable response. </p>\n\n<p>Lately though? Lately I\u2019ve noticed a shift. I still get the \u201cyou\u2019ll change your mind\u201d bullshit but more and more I\u2019m getting another response. It\u2019s coming from women who have kids. Women who are also in their 30s. Maybe are women I don\u2019t even know that well. Their response? Some version of \u201cGood for you, I wish I hadn\u2019t\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>The first few times it caught me off guard. That\u2019s not something you expect to hear from a mother. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it at first. Now though? It\u2019s happened enough times that I\u2019ve had tome to think about those responses and I\u2019ve come to understand and feel for this women. They\u2019re saying something they aren\u2019t supposed to say. They\u2019re expressing feelings they aren\u2019t supposed to have. They&#39;re doing it to me because they\u2019ve identified me as someone who might understand them, that it might be safe to share this with me, <strong>because it isn\u2019t safe for them to share these feelings</strong>. Because they aren\u2019t supposed to feel that way. It\u2019s the same reason you\u2019ve used a throwaway. </p>\n\n<p>Because it isn\u2019t safe. </p>\n\n<p>Because people wouldn\u2019t understand.</p>\n\n<p>Because it\u2019s not okay for mothers to feel that way. </p>\n\n<p>But more and more, I think it is how a lot of people feel. It is normal It is okay. It should be safe. Feeling like maybe this isn\u2019t the life that you wanted doesn&#39;t mean you love your children any less. It doesnt mean you\u2019re a bad person or an unloving mother. It means you\u2019re a human who\u2019s wondering what life would be like if you\u2019d chosen differently. </p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to share that for anyone who needed to hear it. I don\u2019t think OP is the asshole, I think a lot more people agree with him than would even admit it.</p>\n</div>",

Because yeah, life without kids is so much more free. </p>\n\n<p>We would never tell him that, of course, but too many people talk about how great being a parent is (or how great being pregnant is), and it\u2019s hard to find people willing to talk about how shitty it can be. How hard it is to find time for yourselves, how stressful it is to have to provide for a child who can\u2019t contribute anything financially for essentially 2 decades, and then will be looking to start their own thing. Shit - how stressful it is to essentially give up two decades of your life. </p>\n\n<p>So, OP - YNTA, but you\u2019re wife definitely is for telling your kid. WTF? Who the fuck does that?!</p>\n</div>",

The only thing that\u2019s selfish is when you bring them here thinking they\u2019ll be a cute little accessory and then ditching them to live like you\u2019re child free upon discovering how much work it is. Not having children is in NO WAY selfish. It\u2019s the opposite. \n\nI\u2019m a mother and I have zero regrets. I\u2019ve always known I wanted to be a mom. My friend recently told me she doesn\u2019t want kids and thought I would think she was nuts or deficient in some way. I told her she had to be kidding. The amount of emotional labor and sacrifice (mental, physical, financial, you name it) that goes into raising kids is extreme. There is a reason they say this is the hardest job there is. Even someone like me who has always been and still is sure of my decision to procreate has moments where I\u2019m like \u201cwtfffff have I done\u201d but I get over them quick because I was meant to be a parent and the sacrifice is worth it to me. But it is not for everyone and I don\u2019t understand why some people don\u2019t get that. I can\u2019t imagine what someone who was on the fence about it would feel like if they were doing this. Not everyone is supposed to be a parent! Ffs the world is populated enough. When I meet people who are sure of their decision not to have children, I don\u2019t sit there wondering why lol. I think a lot of child free people think parents don\u2019t understand them but the vast majority of us really really do.",

Not having children is in NO WAY selfish. It\u2019s the opposite. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m a mother and I have zero regrets. I\u2019ve always known I wanted to be a mom. My friend recently told me she doesn\u2019t want kids and thought I would think she was nuts or deficient in some way. I told her she had to be kidding. The amount of emotional labor and sacrifice (mental, physical, financial, you name it) that goes into raising kids is extreme. There is a reason they say this is the hardest job there is. Even someone like me who has always been and still is sure of my decision to procreate has moments where I\u2019m like \u201cwtfffff have I done\u201d but I get over them quick because I was meant to be a parent and the sacrifice is worth it to me. But it is not for everyone and I don\u2019t understand why some people don\u2019t get that. I can\u2019t imagine what someone who was on the fence about it would feel like if they were doing this. Not everyone is supposed to be a parent! Ffs the world is populated enough. When I meet people who are sure of their decision not to have children, I don\u2019t sit there wondering why lol. I think a lot of child free people think parents don\u2019t understand them but the vast majority of us really really do.</p>\n</div>",

Even though it's 2019 parenthood is, on average, enormously sexist. I've seen women go into parenthood thinking their situation is different but all of them ended up the same. I know there ARE exceptions. Some fathers are truly equal, and some are even the primary caregiver or the only caregiver. It does happen. But on average? The extreme majority? No. Studies have shown women (who work full time) do TWICE the amount of childcare men do - on AVERAGE. That's not counting emotional labour (planning, remembering birthdays and dr appointments, coordinating with other kids or events) nor does it count housework, which both also mostly fall on women, it's just the face to face childcare. For women having kids usually becomes basically a second full time job. That's why even women who didn't MEAN to get mommytracked at work usually end up doing so anyway as they're the one always expected to deal with the kid being sick from school, soccer practice, and whatever else while the man typically makes no sacrifices in his career. He makes sacrifices in his social life, but not nearly to the degree a woman usually has to. \n\nIf that's what you want in life, as a woman, you're in luck - having kids basically guarantees it. For some people, raising kids can be so fulfilling even when it's at the expense of everything else (work, social life). But if you want an egalitarian partner to raise kids with, it's not an easy find.",

When she came to me out of the blue and told me she didnt love me anymore and hasn't for years it gutted me. There was no chance to work on things, it was just...over. Just like that. I dont think I'll ever recover. It's been over 6 months since that day and it still hurts just as bad. The feelings of anger, abandonment, utter loneliness seem like they'll never go away. Please anyone reading this, hug your spouse, tell them you love them, reconnect before it's too late. No matter how much you think it is, love is not unconditional.",

        "body": "This is a large reason why I don't want kids. It's not that my partner wouldn't make a good dad, but it's doubtful he'd step up in the way I'd want or need. I already don't want kids, so the burden of taking on more than 50% of the work. He's an amazing partner and we're good about splitting things 50/50 all together, but we divide an concur. It's harder to do that with a kid. Even if he doesn't mean it that way, I know the chances are low we'd actually be splitting the actions and mental capacity to raise a kid 50/50.\n\nRight now we have a cat together and while I'm traveling for work he does a great job keeping her alive, but I do the actual keeping her alive.

All your hopes and dreams become the back burner to rent and food and child care. You stop being you and become a care giver. For a long long LONG time.\n\nMy son turned 14 yesterday. As you hear so much, it goes by in the blink of an eye.... Except it kind of doesn't. Not when you're doing it alone. Not when everyday is a struggle for years and years on end. Not when you're just getting older and the days look the same and you have no personal growth because you're too tired and poor to invest in yourself... Everything goes to your child.\n\nBut to be honest, yesterday kind of hit me hard. 14 seems incredible, it seems impossible I did this. If he knew what I've been through, I don't know... He only knows a pretty privileged life that I've provided. I've shielded him from a lot of the pitfalls of single parenthood... We live in a wealthy area (spent YEARS searching for an apartment here so we could live in a nice city!) and I've made personal sacrifices that he'll never know or realize so that he can have normal. Normal car, normal school, normal life. Just no dad and honestly many kids are in the same boat so it's not terrible.\n\nIt's not what I would have chosen, it's not what I expected, it's not... It's hard to explain how you love this person very much but in the process you've ruined what would have been your life. Maybe you'd have traveled or your career could have been anything! Maybe you'd have dated or gotten married or maybe you'd buy a gypsy or join the fucking circus. You'll never know because life abruptly forked your life path making that first path blocked, forever.\n\nYou grieve a person that you could have been and never will ever get that time or person back. You make the most of your days with your child and new life but you never forget that you didn't choose this and it's something you must live with.\n\nAll that to say, I understand. I am you, ten years in your future. It's gotten harder, easier, harder again. It is only very very recently that I've looked back at baby pictures and cried. Cried because I did my best and I so wish I could just have him at that age now. Now that I'm older and settled and would be so much more capable and better equipped. I missed out because I could not fully appreciate it then and no one can tell you that \"someday you will\". For me, I wouldn't tell you that. You will grieve the person you could have been for a very long time and then you will reach acceptance and wistfully wonder, what if I could just do this now instead of having to have missed out then? I don't wish to go back to those days but I wish I could have those days back and then have my son right now. It's tough and no one to talk openly to about it without being judged.",

I missed out because I could not fully appreciate it then and no one can tell you that &quot;someday you will&quot;. For me, I wouldn&#39;t tell you that. You will grieve the person you could have been for a very long time and then you will reach acceptance and wistfully wonder, what if I could just do this now instead of having to have missed out then? I don&#39;t wish to go back to those days but I wish I could have those days back and then have my son right now. It&#39;s tough and no one to talk openly to about it without being judged.</p>\n</div>",

She goes to a center with nurses and caretakers on hand that teach her how best to care for the newborn, nutritious catered meals three times a day, screen visitors, can take care of the newborn and wheel it in only when the mom wants (great for PPD, so I'm told), amidst many, many other functions. The most lavish of them resemble five star hotels and have yoga and fitness coaches to help the new mom get back on her feet.\n\nOr she might stay at home and her mom/MIL will come and do the same thing for her -- minus the professional advice/care of course.\n\nThis kind of service and month is completely expected and accepted in society. In fact, it's a bit of an outrage if the new mom doesn't get it (unless she didn't want it, of course). When I used to work locally, there were private rooms for new mom to pump breastmilk if they wanted. A coworker did that often when she came back from maternity leave and not an eye was batted. Meetings were scheduled around her and people knew what was up when her desk was randomly empty at 3pm.\n\n[edit] To me, that's also what it means to have a social net/commitment from the surrounding society.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I see a lot of European responses and wanted to jump in with something possibly unique from the Asian perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the usual monthly monetary help, free education, healthcare, maternity leave etc, I see a lot of emphasis on taking care of the new mom in Taiwan. </p>\n\n<p>The month immediately succeeding childbirth is one wholly focused on recovery for the mom. She goes to a center with nurses and caretakers on hand that teach her how best to care for the newborn, nutritious catered meals three times a day, screen visitors, can take care of the newborn and wheel it in only when the mom wants (great for PPD, so I&#39;m told), amidst many, many other functions. The most lavish of them resemble five star hotels and have yoga and fitness coaches to help the new mom get back on her feet.</p>\n\n<p>Or she might stay at home and her mom/MIL will come and do the same thing for her -- minus the professional advice/care of course.</p>\n\n<p>This kind of service and month is completely expected and accepted in society. In fact, it&#39;s a bit of an outrage if the new mom doesn&#39;t get it (unless she didn&#39;t want it, of course).

But I also DON'T think most guys who do this are evil or just don't care. I think they don't realize it's happening and fall into bad habits.\n\nI think you absolutely should not give up on it, and I say this as someone who doesn't want kids - but it's something to keep in mind. The biggest issue I see in couples with and without kids is \"woman as household manager\".

There are ways to prevent this happening and they mostly involve a ton of communication and both partners being honest and not defensive. \n\nI do not know a single couple where the woman is \"lies on couch, eats bonbons, and yells at her hard working husband to do everything\" - I do however know couples who are more or less even and those with the imbalance described above.  I wonder if part of this is socioeconomics in that the \"eats bonbons\" stereotype is more associated with the upper class/rich people and I don't know any of those, lol.
