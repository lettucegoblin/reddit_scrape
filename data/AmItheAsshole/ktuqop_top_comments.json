I am a Pediatric Doctor and she's an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. \n\nMy wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. \n\nI had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. \n\nPredictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am a Pediatric Doctor and she&#39;s an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p>My wife has a tendency to say things like &#39;Money doesn&#39;t matter&#39; and that &#39;material things don&#39;t matter&#39; and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she&#39;s right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn&#39;t be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven&#39;t said anything up until this morning. </p>\n\n<p>I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual &#39;money doesn&#39;t matter&#39;. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. </p>\n\n<p>Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I&#39;m wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Money does solve a lot of problems. It can buy comfort. \n\nBut I really don\u2019t believe it can buy happiness. Kids who grow up financially privileged may even face a certain kind of barrier to happiness in that they often become adults without learning the fundamental skills necessary for self-actualization (eg personal accountability, the ability to tolerate discomfort/hard work in the interest of a greater goal, being rewarded in exchange for making a positive contribution, etc). And that\u2019s not even going into all the problems money *can\u2019t* solve so easily (like trauma, abuse, chronic mental / physical illness, disconnection from others, etc). \n\nPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m saying we should all try harder to pity all the poor little rich people with their rich people problems - It\u2019s the responsibility of those with privilege to understand how much harder life is for those without, not the other way around. I just think comfort and lack of struggle shouldn\u2019t be equated with happiness. \n\nMy perspective may be skewed by personal experience, though. My childhood best friend was *ridiculously* rich - like, her birthday party every year was flying a bunch of friends to Anguilla on a private jet. Her reward when she stopped biting her nails in third grade was a meet and greet with Ricky Martin. Whenever I played at her house and we made a mess, her parents would send someone out to *buy me new clothes* instead of throwing my stuff in the washing machine. That level of wealthy. As she got older, she worked really, really hard to lead a meaningful life because she believed other people were more deserving than she was. \n\nShe committed suicide at 17. I know she experienced some sort of trauma in middle school, but she also had access to the best psychiatric care in the world. Her parents grew up pretty poor and they definitely thought they could buy her happiness - they set out to give her everything they didn\u2019t have, but they ended up throwing money at problems that couldn\u2019t be paid off. I really do believe that on some level, growing up at the top of the financial hierarchy (having access to anything she could ever want or need without having to work for it) left her feeling completely directionless, like she had nothing to aim for and like nothing she ever did could really matter. I remember her crying when she got accepted to an Ivy League school because, even though she was first in our grade and had worked hard her whole high school career, she believed that her family\u2019s name/tax bracket would have gotten her the spot regardless. \n\nTLDR: comfort \u2260 happiness and I didn\u2019t realize how much I ruminate about my dead friend",

I was 29 and just found out I was pregnant and my husband was starting a new job that was a massive pay cut in the short term but would be way better in the long run and the pay cut was fine because I was working. Well, I had a perfect storm of events that caused a sinus infection to travel through my blood and settle in my spine. I made the mistake of being a woman who was also pregnant because when the pain was so debilitating that I truly couldn't move, I was told that it was because I was \"pregnant and pregnancy can be uncomfortable\" by 2 separate ER doctors. I was 6 weeks pregnant...there was no way *that* was causing this pain. Well, because of that it festered until I was in really bad shape at 13 weeks and was stuck in the floor of our condo for hours until my husband got home from work, thankfully my OB took it seriously and met us at the ER. It ended up being a years long issue but I couldn't work and was in the hospital for months then home with a health aide. That pay cut that was fine because I was working? Suddenly not fine because I couldn't work and add in huge medical bills AND a newborn? We were totally and completely fucked. I had a disability lawyer and went to court for SSD and they acknowledged the issues, the pain and the impact of had on my life but said that \"the timing of my illness along with becoming a mother was too coincidental\" and it got denied. My lawyer said he'd been doing this a long time and getting a lawyer used to be a slam dunk but now it's 50/50 and judges are leaving left and right because they're forced to deny 50% of cases. I could've appealed but I didn't have it in me. My husband is in a really good (read: much better paying) step in his career, it's almost been 6 years and we're finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel but there were many, many months we didn't know where our food would come from.",
