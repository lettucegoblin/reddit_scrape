No amount of punishment, therapists, or sit down talks could stop the rage I felt playing any competitive sport/game and losing. It's reactionary, and most likely completely involuntary and unwanted. You're just filled with white hot rage and next thing you know a prized possession is smashed on the floor and you're filled with shame.\nAll that to say that these issues are serious, and need to be worked on, but most likely your son has very little control over these tantrums. Only time and acquired maturity will fix these things, and until then its important to support him and be understanding.\nYour son needs to learn, and he will, with time and the good supportive parenting that you seem to be giving him. But its important that he feels understood when dealing with this big problem. The outburst of laughter, while probably unwanted on your end, might have left him feeling even more ashamed and powerless with this issue he's been trying to deal with for some time.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>ESH</p>\n\n<p>Ill preface this by saying in no world should you even consider rebuying the chair.</p>\n\n<p>As a teenager I struggled with many of the same issues your son had. No amount of punishment, therapists, or sit down talks could stop the rage I felt playing any competitive sport/game and losing. It&#39;s reactionary, and most likely completely involuntary and unwanted. You&#39;re just filled with white hot rage and next thing you know a prized possession is smashed on the floor and you&#39;re filled with shame.\nAll that to say that these issues are serious, and need to be worked on, but most likely your son has very little control over these tantrums. Only time and acquired maturity will fix these things, and until then its important to support him and be understanding.\nYour son needs to learn, and he will, with time and the good supportive parenting that you seem to be giving him. But its important that he feels understood when dealing with this big problem. The outburst of laughter, while probably unwanted on your end, might have left him feeling even more ashamed and powerless with this issue he&#39;s been trying to deal with for some time.</p>\n</div>",

Let me guess: Was it Halo or Modern Warfare?</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a whole wide, engaging world of videogames, and multiplayer shooters are among the most competitive and stressful of the lot. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other modern <em>and good</em> games he could be playing that are less intense and less-likely to trigger the same kind of outburst.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you very directly described them as &quot;online multiplayer shooters&quot; suggests you have a good grasp of what you are talking about, so this isn&#39;t a case of &quot;clueless parent doesn&#39;t know what their child is doing&quot; and I think it might be beneficial for you to sit down with your son and discuss what he likes and enjoys with gaming, and then work with him to figure out games that he might enjoy that won&#39;t fuel his destructive impulses.</p>\n\n<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It just seems like this part should have already happened before he smashed an expensive piece of furniture. Or even allow multiplayer, but only for a certain amount of time per day, and only cooperative games. Games where you work with other players to achieve goals against computer-controlled opponents tend to be far lower-stress than ones where you directly compete against other players.</p>\n</div>",

This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. \n\nI was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.\n\nAfter talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.\n\nHowever, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he \"really liked it\" and \"it would only be fair\", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely unable to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \"fair\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\n\nThis obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say \"but I need a chair!\" or \"What am I supposed to do now\" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.\n\nHe's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the past few years I've moved from shooters to other games like rpg's, mmo's and other better gaming experiences. The only way I can describe the reason I broke them is when something went wrong, or when something made me mad I had a sudden rush of energy that I had to expel instantly, whether it was slamming my hand on my desk, hitting something expensive or squeezing something, as long as it got it out. Pretty sure I would've ripped a stress toy in half in some situations. But I never expected my parents to replace the stuff I broke, I always tried to replace it myself (this was when I was  13 to 15) like I said, recently I've learnt that I should stay away from multiplayer competitive games (for the most part).\nAll that being said, I'd say NTA, it was probably harsh to laugh so hard but still wrong of him to expect you to pay again to replace it.",
