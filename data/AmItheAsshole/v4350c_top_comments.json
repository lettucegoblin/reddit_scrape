Day of ceremony, he and stepmom were supposed to come. I even stopped by their house prior to the ceremony. Shocking, he was a no show..... My ceremony was a half hour away from home. He had two children with stepmom. Was able to fly halfway across the country to watch my brother graduate from boot camp. Unfortunately your dad's behavior towards you is not going to change, which sucks. Been NC with \"bio dad\" for about 12 years now and he literally lives a block away from me. Just realize that his behavior is not your fault. Congratulations on your graduation \ud83c\udf93",

I waited outside for like 2-3 hrs before my mother finally decided to call him. She handed me the phone after talking with him so he could tell me. She wasn\u2019t going to deliver the bad news for him. Excitedly I asked, \u201cWhere you at, Dad?\u201d He replied, \u201cI forgot. I can\u2019t take you. Maybe some other time.\u201d Its the same response my sisters had always warned me about. I held back my emotion with tears welling in my eyes and just told him straight forward, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,(first name)\u201d and hung up immediately. I had always called him dad even though he wasn\u2019t in my life. At 10 years old, I told myself, \u201cDon\u2019t rely on this man.

My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.\n\nDad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.\n\nWhen I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.\n\nIn 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.\n\nDad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Op ur dad has constantly let u down and not only missed important times in ur life in favor of his step kids again and again but made promises he didn\u2019t keep and even asked for money back! And it was just for a kids birthday party! Lil kids party\u2019s don\u2019t need to be expensive! Their dad never put op before his step kids, op should ask them that like when have u ever put me before them? It was always op dealing with their dad abandoning plans, using money that was suppose to go to op towards his step kids, changing plans to do something the lil kids wanted to do and would enjoy instead of what op wanted to and would enjoy. \n\nI don\u2019t see how the step mom and step kids  couldn\u2019t realize with it happening over years for a long time and noticed how the father\u2019s relationship with op has changed from being close to not as close since he\u2019s constantly neglected op and put them on the back burner with his time, attention and money going towards them instead of his actually son . They and op\u2019s dad just don\u2019t want to face the fact that they are responsible for how op and his dad\u2019s relationship has evolved to from them constantly putting themselves before op every time. They don\u2019t want to take accountability that all that they did has ended up with op his actual kid cutting off contact with the dad because of how he failed him. I mean like the dad couldn\u2019t work out the times and stuff to see both of them in the hospital? \n\nNaw they don\u2019t want to admit it\u2019s because of them and now are picking at straws to make op the bad guy so they feel better about the dad not being invited or wanted at his graduation and being cut out of op\u2019s life where he wouldn\u2019t be invited to anymore of his major events like for college and wedding. It\u2019s manipulative & gas lighting to make op feel bad and go back to them only to once again go along be treated unequally like u don\u2019t matter like his other kids and do whatever their kids want. \n\nI mean what teenager would want to go to a kiddie park or kid play area (where most places wouldn\u2019t let op play but watch because of their size and age) instead of going on a hike or movie. Like no that isn\u2019t better then what their plan was and WHY did op & his dad HAVE TO GO WITH THEM to those kiddie things?! Their mom could\u2019ve taken them to do that by herself while op and their dad did their own thing instead of watching the kids play from the sidelines!!!\n\nI see now he does have bio kids with her but that changes nothing, he kept putting his new family 1st and constantly put them before op and did it before he had kids with her. Op had big events where the dad was to pay half and he was asking that op missed out on them so the money could go to throwing his step kids a huge birthday party, lil kids don\u2019t need expensive parties like just throw it at home with guests! He knew op missing out on these events would hurt them & cause them to feel they were missing out and such but didn\u2019t care because he cared more about throwing a huge party for his new family! \n\nNo they are trying to make op the bad guy so they feel better about being cut off from op\u2019s life. The step mom is just as bad and it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t care about op and how each decision effected op negatively as long as her kids were happy & spoiled. She just doesn\u2019t want her husband to blame her and now using whatever she can to turn this around and blame op. Wtf telling op to handle & talk about this like a adult since they\u2019re 18?! They\u2019ve been handling this for years and now that they\u2019re 18 they no longer can be forced to go or have a relationship with the dad. \n\nThey made their bed now they gotta sleep in it and have no one to blame about this but themselves. And who can blame op if they did make a scene like this was the last straw after constantly being treated like their feelings of being sad & neglected like they don\u2019t matter etc about it, big events or such didn\u2019t matter with them constantly coming in last place every time to their dad\u2019s new family\n\nOp cut them all out and block them all, I think they dont think ur serious like with how they said let\u2019s talk and handle this like adults, which is downplaying all they did while making it seem like u were overreacting or such. Let them see ur serious about cutting them all out. Be prepared to see them still go to ur gradation thinking they can and u will just accept it but don\u2019t talk to them or anything and just walk away like u don\u2019t even know them. They  can\u2019t force u to say or do anything and probably think u won\u2019t call them out there or anything since it\u2019s in public. They been playing favorites and neglecting u so they don\u2019t get to act like they haven\u2019t been and also act like ur overreacting or being dramatic like ur blowing this up over nothing. \n\nCutting them out would be cutting out the toxicity in ur life and not letting them continue to neglect, treat u horribly, let u down and they put themselves ur dad\u2019s new family over you like u don\u2019t matter or existed. Stop all communications so they see ur serious, they can\u2019t pretend they did nothing wrong I mean u were never put 1st, when did ur dad put u 1st before them??? Like He couldn\u2019t even go on a hike with u and do the kiddie park another day!?.

I've never said anything against him, he did all the hard work himself.\n\nand it is hard work to alienate a child because they're so resiliant and desperate for that relationship. they forgive everything. it's not fair. but my ex is up to the task.\n\nlikewise my eldest. her dad disappeared when she was 2 - he was stealing from my house when he would have visitation so I put my foot down and it all became so much drama for him. this was after this 30yr old man had bankrupted 19yr old me. so he left. for years. I never said a bad word against him. only told my kid that her dad loved her so much that he didn't want her growing up around fighting. I never told her what a greasy manipulative con artist he was. but I always said that hey, when you're old enough, when you want to find him, I will help.\n\nand I did.. when she was 16 she asked and I tracked him down through centrelink (our welfare system). she met him twice before she came home and said *he's a liar isn't he*.. and I snorted my drink out my nose laughing and said yes.\n\nmy ex was a brilliant con artist, he would never talk shit about me. thats too easy. he would talk me up, create this fantasy about how I was a saint and how he had learned many lessons, he was a changed man because of what he went through losing his kid!\n\nbut the idealized version of me (my kid knows me, we are all quite open about our limitations lol), the fact that he never tried to make contact, never sent support, gave my kid money and then hinted that he might need a few bucks back, ambushed her first meeting with his entire extended family, promised the next time they would go out to the waterpark, brought his new gfs family of 7 and basically ignored her for 4hrs... I'm glad my 16yr old could spot the fuckery that lead to my downfall before she invested too much hope. I didn't have to say a thing. 16yrs of silence and this guys behaviour over 2 days spoke for itself.\n\nand that ambush.. that was basically what getting me pregnant was. this guy had conned his whole family out of money to buy a cafe, destroyed their retirement, was literally AWOL from the army. he thought a baby could leverage him back into his family's good Grace's. he used my kid when she was 16 to try to do it again. disgusting.",

She\u2019s a bi-polar narcissist who is now in a major health decline and God forgive me but I just want this chapter over so I can move on. I guess it\u2019s just good to know that you all see that and understand that we\u2019re not bad people for not visiting or caring.</p>\n</div>",
