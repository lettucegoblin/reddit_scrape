One day as I was walking up to my apartment a group of black ladies stopped me and asked me if it was the British flag. I said, &quot;no, that&#39;s the Confederate flag.&quot; And she was just like, &quot;that ain&#39;t right!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It was a bizarre experience I&#39;ll never forget, I just kept thinking how strange it was I had to explain that to a group of black women what flag that was. Granted, I don&#39;t live in the South, and I don&#39;t know where they were from either. But I definitely don&#39;t think they were from a Southern state or they probably would have not had to ask me, a white guy, which flag it was.</p>\n</div>",

Ir seems to work and has kept tension down ever since the \"White Chalk Line of 2017\" incident nearly brought them to blows. I expect next week one of them to cause a ruckus with their weekly get together of friends (probably the History Professor, you know they debate things) that causes the prized ficus to be smashed and a new journey of discovery.\n\nAll here on BBC 5.",
