Because it's part of a big, big conversation about gender, all kinds of caregiving labor, and basic quality of life.\n\nMothers, in many ways, are instilled with the belief that motherhood is suffering, *should* be suffering, that suffering makes them better mothers. It's the rationale behind the belief that you stay with a shit partner \"for the kids,\" behind abortion bans, behind \"breast is best\" feeding ideology even if formula is easier on mother and child, behind the general notion of shaming mothers for having a sense of identity beyond motherhood.\n\nAnd it extends into other types of caregiving, professional ones (which by no coincidence are largely performed by women). Teachers striking for livable pay and safe conditions are told they're being selfish and they should think of the kids. Nurses are shamed for being unable to keep up with impossible staffing ratios.

Though they really shouldn&#39;t have gotten married in the first place. \nMy mom kept pushing me and my siblings to marry sooner instead of being &quot;engaged to be engaged&quot; for years leaving room for temptation and sin. I don&#39;t know about my siblings, but for me I was pretty much &quot;I can see the relationship you and dad have after marrying less than a year after meeting and only dating for 6 months. That&#39;s not the relationship I want. I want to marry someone who actually likes me and doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m stupid.&quot; We&#39;ve been married for 16 years and together for 19 and I can very proudly say that our relationship is nothing like my parents&#39;.</p>\n</div>",
