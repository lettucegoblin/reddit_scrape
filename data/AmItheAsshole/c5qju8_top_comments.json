Contributions can be made to the account by any family member and for 33/50 states, those contributions are state tax *deductible* to the contributor.\n\nThat's not the most exciting part about it though.  The exciting bit is all the gains made in the account are  federal *and* state tax-free when withdrawn provided it is a qualified distribution, which basically means any expenses for college, like tuition, room & board, books, computers, etc...\n\nI say this because you can create the 529, give your mother & aunt the information to contribute to it, and not have to worry about any identity theft issues with disseminating anyone's social security number.  They get an account, and per the rules of the account, nobody but the beneficiary can withdraw, and then only for educational expenses.\n\nIf you're interested I suggest you head over to /r/personalfinance.  Those guys can hook you up with what you need to know.  There's more to this than I've mentioned, mainly because we don't know what state you live in: 529 plans vary from state to state.  Indeed, some states offer a variant whereby you buy educational credits now, and current prices, and you can attend college with them by paying **credits** instead of tuition.  What's the difference?  Well if the class costs $1,000 a credit in 2019 and $3,000 a credit in 2039 when your kid goes to school, it's kind of nice to have bought the credits, right?  200% returns over 20 years is pretty damn good!  Anyway point is your options will vary from state-to-state so you'll need to do some of your own research.\n\nOh, and P.S. - NTA.  *Duh-doy*.",

All of this requires use of the Minor&#39;s social, as it&#39;s the primary way to tie the funds to them.</p>\n</div>",

They said the $0.00 charge was to see if the account was active, and the other two was someone else using my card.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s all squared away as of yesterday, and I already got my replacement card.</p>\n\n<p>But normally I don&#39;t look at that account online all that often. It was just accidental it was the same day it happened.</p>\n\n<p>But as far as family goes, we all want to think we can trust relatives but the company I worked for had a thief a few years ago who tried to get us by playing with the bank deposits. He got caught, but while it was all going on we discovered he&#39;d stolen his own parents&#39; and his sibling&#39;s identities and charged thousands of dollars to each of them.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d rather have a stranger steal than family.</p>\n</div>",

But, you don\u2019t know who\u2019s around her or has access to her information. I can\u2019t speak for every bank, but most banks will let you open accounts for children where family can deposit into it and they are blocked from any other access or information. If it\u2019s an online or brick and mortar bank, if you set this up, watch your mail! You\u2019ll almost always have paperwork that needs signing and it\u2019s super important to sign that stuff!\nHonestly most fraud comes from an outside source, due to a skimmer on a gas pump, ATM or website for example. After that fraud comes from a family member, sometimes by complete accident. And rarely it\u2019s just an error. If I deal with 20 cases in a day, about five or six will be fraud caused by a family member. About 90 percent of calls to a bank are fraud related so it\u2019s a nonstop ordeal.\n\n\nGlad to hear it all worked out!",

I live across the country from my brother and wanted to set up a 529 for his daughter. It was always hard to figure out what gifts to send her as kids grow and change interests so quickly.  \n\nI had the idea to open this account and make deposits for all special occasions and then she could use it for her education when she was 18. I wanted to open this account specifically for her from me and my husband so she would be able to see and understand the gifts we would be giving her over the years.  I did not want other people having access to it for that reason. Kids can have multiple 529s so there is no reason not to have a separate one. \n\nInitially my brother and SIL agreed and liked the idea, but when I asked for her social security number to open the account they refused and were extremely cruel about it. I've never done anything to make them not trust me. I simply wanted to do something special for her (my brother and I never received this type of help and both struggled to complete our education). \n\nWhen I calculated the contributions plus interest on the website,  this pettiness on their part has cost their daughter roughly $15,000. She now gets toys and clothing which I'm sure are tossed aside as soon as she opens them. People, and parents specifically on reddit are so over the top on this issue. I've had my identity stolen twice. It might be a pain to straighten out but there is no lasting damage or responsibility, especially for a minor.  Not worth destroying relationships over, and treating close family whom are trying to do something wonderful for your child like an enemy. \n\nMy niece will now have no college fund (her parents are not financially responsible) and perhaps I can explain to her why that is the case when she is an adult.\n\nEdit: thanks for the downvotes. Screw me for wanting to help my family, right? I'm such a horrible person!",
