It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nI have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I didn&#39;t want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a &#39;pussy&#39;. </p>\n\n<p>Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, &quot;damn M0shka you famous now&quot; (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He&#39;d say stuff like &quot;His posts suck. They&#39;re not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He&#39;s a &#39;photographer&#39; who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it&#39;s still terrible. I&#39;d say he&#39;s more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). </p>\n\n<p>Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn&#39;t met him since the post) and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t get Nat Geo&quot;. To which he got angry again and said, &quot;I&#39;d rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I&#39;m doing is making real art and it&#39;s something your robot brain won&#39;t ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you&quot;. He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, &quot;Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You&#39;re a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You&#39;re not going to amount to anything in life so just --- <em>I get cut off here</em>&quot; </p>\n\n<p>His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? </p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "If you choose to apologize, I would only apologize for the timing/location of your actions, but not the actions themselves.\n\n\u201cThe party was not an appropriate place to express those opinions. I want to apologize for saying them there. I certainly could have chosen a better time and place to say those things.\u201d\n\nAlso, I\u2019m married to a pro photographer who went to one of the best photography programs in the world. She\u2019s really fucking good and her circle of friends includes photojournalists for top news agencies, magazines, and some pretty prominent artists.\n\nI remember going to a wedding with some of them. When the wedding photographer told me he had ambitions to do more, I suggested he talk to this group. He seemed like a nice young man at first.  I thought I\u2019d make his day by introducing him, especially since one of them is fairly \u201cfamous\u201d (in the photography world).\n\nBut instead of asking why he should talk to them, or who they were, He just starts talking about how great he is, what an artist he is, how his work is amazing and even got praise from [fmaoua photographer] who was actually sitting there and douchebag didn\u2019t even realize it. And [famous photographer]\u2019s face was priceless, like \u201cwho the fuck is this idiot? I don\u2019t know him or his work.\u201d  The jackass is handing over his phone and showing his work. And everyone\u2019s trying to be nice, give truly helpful critiques and suggestions in a nice way, and he\u2019s telling them they just don\u2019t understand photography.  They\u2019re not artists. They don\u2019t get it.\n\nI stopped him and suggested he talk less and listen more.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If you choose to apologize, I would only apologize for the timing/location of your actions, but not the actions themselves.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe party was not an appropriate place to express those opinions. I want to apologize for saying them there. I certainly could have chosen a better time and place to say those things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Also, I\u2019m married to a pro photographer who went to one of the best photography programs in the world. She\u2019s really fucking good and her circle of friends includes photojournalists for top news agencies, magazines, and some pretty prominent artists.</p>\n\n<p>I remember going to a wedding with some of them. When the wedding photographer told me he had ambitions to do more, I suggested he talk to this group. He seemed like a nice young man at first.  I thought I\u2019d make his day by introducing him, especially since one of them is fairly \u201cfamous\u201d (in the photography world).</p>\n\n<p>But instead of asking why he should talk to them, or who they were, He just starts talking about how great he is, what an artist he is, how his work is amazing and even got praise from [fmaoua photographer] who was actually sitting there and douchebag didn\u2019t even realize it. And [famous photographer]\u2019s face was priceless, like \u201cwho the fuck is this idiot? I don\u2019t know him or his work.\u201d  The jackass is handing over his phone and showing his work. And everyone\u2019s trying to be nice, give truly helpful critiques and suggestions in a nice way, and he\u2019s telling them they just don\u2019t understand photography.  They\u2019re not artists. They don\u2019t get it.</p>\n\n<p>I stopped him and suggested he talk less and listen more. But the guy was just so full of himself he couldn\u2019t talk about anything but his own awesomeness. </p>\n\n<p>I so wanted the group to smack him down and let him know he was actually talking to [famous photographer] and others who held the \u201cdream job\u201d he aspired to get.

Your exact choice of words weren't great, but the actual message needed to be said, and if anything you waited about a year too long to do it.\n\nI've known plenty of people like John, and tolerated some of them (and their friends) for far too long. They fall into this weird valley between /r/iamverysmart, /r/im14andthisisdeep, and /r/niceguys. There's probably a word for this exact type of person - they're shockingly common - but I don't know it.\n\nWhat John needs to be told is exactly what you already told him, but using completely different words. Unless something's phrased *exactly right*, people living in John's valley not only disregard it - they actively choose to believe the opposite is true. If you say something in anger, or swear at all, or use certain \"pleb words\" (one of which happens to be \"mooching\", in most cases), or mispronounce anything, they'll think that not only are you wrong - but the direct opposite of what you're saying is the real truth.\n\nIt's difficult to explain the logic, because it's so difficult to comprehend, but at its heart it's deeply childish: If you're saying these mean things, it must *only* be because they're not true. They're so not-true that they stand in direct opposition to the real truth: \n\n>John is an artist on a whole new level of photography, that Nat Geo didn't want his photos because they're *so cutting edge* no respectable journal could safely publish them without stigma. That he's made it so far in life with no qualifications and a relatively low-labour, low-skill job is actually further testament that he's right:\n\n>You don't *need* to go to college to succeed. You can \"game the system\" (wherein \"the system\" is \"capitalism\", broadly speaking) by getting an easy job, and living in a shared house with people you can at least tolerate, ideally who actually like you. Life is cheap, you have spare money, *and* spare time to spend it in.\n\nAnd, *in a sense*, he'd be right. If someone can be *happy* living like that, and the people they live with are happy with it too, honestly, good for them.\n\nBut John isn't happy. No-one in John's valley is happy for long. Reasons vary: clinical depression, unfulfilled goals, low self-esteem - people in John's valley almost always have rock-bottom self-esteem. This \"I'm the greatest\" thing is a projection, because from their peerspective, that's how successful people behave. And they're not wrong there either, they just...lack the success to to build the \"I'm great\" pretense on top of.\n\nThey're very much children playing at being adult. Not just in terms of holding childish ideologies or having a childish snap-response to adversary as \"life isn't fair, fuck everything\"; they're *emotionally* children. Literally. They never emotionally progressed beyond childhood. This is a real, psychological phenomenon - and John's valley is where people like that tend to fall.\n\nThis got...way more metaphysical than I intended.\n\nTL;DR: Yeah, you were an asshole, but not because John and his entire family didn't deserve to be told; because your language means John now has more reason to stay where he is and you had the perfect opportunity to tell *everyone* why John is where he is and what he (and everyone else) needs to do to get him out. And honestly if you don't understand this concept of John's live from his perspective, you had no way of knowing there was a better way to say it. So really, you would have been a *worse* asshole by pretending everything was fine. IMO, you chose a valid path.

John sounds like those fucking losers from Clerks, judging everyone while their own lives are pure garbage.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just wanted to add this. Could you have handled the situation better? Yes. Could you have picked a better way to confront him and stand up for yourself? Yes. But at the end of the day, he is in the wrong, 100%, not you. People have their breaking points and you held it in as long as you could in order to try and form an actual friendship with the asshole. He didn&#39;t want that. He saw you as an easy and convenient punching bag. You can&#39;t really be blamed.</p>\n</div>",

You can guess what strategy I faced.

I shifted schools again because the new one was better in all aspects and my mother had a job there so commute was easier. Now my mother worked there a year before I came there and had already told teachers how good I am at studies so expectations were already high. On top of that, I was put in \"competition\" against another kid who joined the school same time as me. Let's call him Jack. Now Jack LOVED maths. He practically breathed it. He was so into it that he completed courses before the class as a hobby because he just loved solving questions. Now for whatever reason, my mother thought it would be a good idea to brag about him in the house THE ENTIRE TIME. We were friends but tbh after hearing how is better than me every day and being reminded that I am not as good as him yet got to me. I legit wished him harm and started doing the exact shit that John did to OP, trying to show how he is not as great as he thinks (as I thought), trying to show his downfalls, ridiculing him out of spite. \n\nBut then after we had a verbal fight I started thinking. This guy has been nothing but good to me. If anything, he hasn't even responded violently to my harmful words. That's when I realized how shitty I was being. Needless to say, I apologized to him and we're great friends now.\n\nFunnily enough, the same thing happened the next year. A new student who the teachers tried to make me compete against. Fortunately, I was so over that shit I didn't do it again and once more, he's another great friend who'll probably do something great in the future.",

They don\u2019t care if you made them feel uncomfortable because you\u2019re uncomfortable - only the fact that you made them feel uncomfortable is what matters to them.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s an impersonal lesson I have to keep in the front of my mind at all times. </p>\n</div>",
