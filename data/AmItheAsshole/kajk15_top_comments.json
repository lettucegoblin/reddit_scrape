That she can&#39;t eat vegan chick&#39;n nuggets, because although they are allergy safe and tasty, dad thinks vegans are stupid hippies. ITS FOOD FOR GOODNESS SAKE. She&#39;s a kid. She wants to eat normal foods, and if she can eat vegan substitutes, why deny her?</p>\n\n<p>You and your husband are both TA. Your husband for ruining you daughters only friendship over food he isn&#39;t even eating, and you for not sticking up for your daughter. You not cooking him meat is not the stand you think it is.</p>\n</div>",

He thinks she\u2019ll just make more friends and \u2018boys have cooties anyway\u2019\n\nHe's \"not nasty\" but \"it took me a while to realize they were the villains in their anti vegan stories. Unfortunately like I said he whined to his brother and and even he thinks vegans are over sensitive\" and \"he hates vegans.\" He's \"not nasty\" but he picked a fight with people who did nothing wrong. He's *hostile* to people for their dietary choices, which isn't his business. You need to come to terms with the fact that, based on his past behavior, based on his harassment of these people, based on what he said to you and how little he cares about his daughter being lonely, your husband *is* a petty, mean, hateful asshole.\n\nAnd let's be real here, he doesn't believe \"boys have cooties\", he *is* a guy himself, why would he be the one saying boys have cooties? It's not weird just because he *is* a \"boy\", it's also weird because he's too old to be that childish. That's something kids say to other kids in kindergarten. But I guess, because he has cooties, you better separate immediately, you wouldn't want to catch them from him...\n\n>He isn\u2019t sexist at all, in my opinion. He did/does his share of taking care of her and does work around the house too. Unfortunately because of where he\u2019s from he doesn\u2019t realize that he was being offensive. What he did was totally normal to him and families like his.\n\nSo he cooks as well? And therefore could make his own meat dishes? Or is cooking specifically your task? Seems odd to me that this is *your job* to do *his way*, it sounds like you were assigned that task. If you're a SAHM I get that, I'd just be damned if I took attitude about it personally.\n\nJust because his parents are assholes doesn't excuse him being an asshole, at some point you have to separate yourself from your parents and live your own life. You may learn bad habits from them but you can teach yourself new habits as an adult. Unless he's been living under a rock, he can't possibly have missed the push for equal treatment and *against* sexist language/behavior. He really needs to pull his head out of his ass.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sorry to be <em>that person</em> since so many other people upvoted this but the comments you made right before this really make me wonder if you <em>do</em> &quot;know better now&quot;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He\u2019s not nasty I swear. He thinks she\u2019ll just make more friends and \u2018boys have cooties anyway\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He&#39;s &quot;not nasty&quot; but &quot;it took me a while to realize they were the villains in their anti vegan stories. Unfortunately like I said he whined to his brother and and even he thinks vegans are over sensitive&quot; and &quot;he hates vegans.&quot; He&#39;s &quot;not nasty&quot; but he picked a fight with people who did nothing wrong. He&#39;s <em>hostile</em> to people for their dietary choices, which isn&#39;t his business. You need to come to terms with the fact that, based on his past behavior, based on his harassment of these people, based on what he said to you and how little he cares about his daughter being lonely, your husband <em>is</em> a petty, mean, hateful asshole.</p>\n\n<p>And let&#39;s be real here, he doesn&#39;t believe &quot;boys have cooties&quot;, he <em>is</em> a guy himself, why would he be the one saying boys have cooties? It&#39;s not weird just because he <em>is</em> a &quot;boy&quot;, it&#39;s also weird because he&#39;s too old to be that childish. That&#39;s something kids say to other kids in kindergarten. But I guess, because he has cooties, you better separate immediately, you wouldn&#39;t want to catch them from him...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He isn\u2019t sexist at all, in my opinion. He did/does his share of taking care of her and does work around the house too. Unfortunately because of where he\u2019s from he doesn\u2019t realize that he was being offensive. What he did was totally normal to him and families like his.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he cooks as well? And therefore could make his own meat dishes? Or is cooking specifically your task? Seems odd to me that this is <em>your job</em> to do <em>his way</em>, it sounds like you were assigned that task. If you&#39;re a SAHM I get that, I&#39;d just be damned if I took attitude about it personally.</p>\n\n<p>Just because his parents are assholes doesn&#39;t excuse him being an asshole, at some point you have to separate yourself from your parents and live your own life. You may learn bad habits from them but you can teach yourself new habits as an adult. Unless he&#39;s been living under a rock, he can&#39;t possibly have missed the push for equal treatment and <em>against</em> sexist language/behavior. He really needs to pull his head out of his ass.</p>\n</div>",

My ex husband would text my friends from my phone to start fights.  He prevented me from seeing my best friend after his father died because he didn\u2019t want me to \u201ccatch bad luck.\u201d  He refused to write thank you letters to the people who attended our wedding, even to those who gave us 1k+ wedding gifts because he wanted to save money on postage.\n\nDid he physically bar me or prevent me?\n\nNo, but he maintained control in other ways.  I wasn\u2019t allowed to have cash, I couldn\u2019t have a credit or debit card, he hid the car keys, checked my email, and followed all of my texts and phone calls via our mobile account.  He would threaten to kill himself, he would throw things of mine away because I \u201cdidn\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d  Since I didn\u2019t have car keys, I relied on him for all transportation and he would often leave me in the rain until he was finished with his video games and \u201chad the time\u201d to pick me up.\n\nHe would say the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and then tell me I was being unfair if I was still angry about, say, being left in the freezing rain while 6 months pregnant.\n\nHe controlled my entire life and to stand up to him was to risk \u201closing everything.\u201d  The devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\nThe worst part was that when I reached out with a question that was written in a style very similar to OP on a pregnancy forum, I was shredded apart by the mothers there.\n\n\u201cGrow a backbone!  Don\u2019t tolerate that!  Wow, I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d Etc...\n\nWell, when I did stand up to him he got cray cray loco.  He had thrown things before but the first time it got physical was when I stood up to him and told him to stop treating me this way.\n\nI had to call the police just to get away.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if OP is here.  \n\nIt\u2019s a tough place that most people do not understand.  Apologizing and making excuses is honestly a sign that a person is being abused.\n\nYou know their behavior is wrong.  You want it to stop but they don\u2019t listen to you.  You are always the one who is wrong and the one who causes fights.\n\nI don\u2019t think OP\u2019s husband can respect their lifestyle because in his mind they are wrong.  The end.  \n\nAnd then OP is probably cooking two dinners.  One for him and one for their child.\n\nUgh.  My heart goes out to you, OP.  I would put some distance between you and your husband and speak with a therapist.",

They\u2019re not force-feeding him tofu. \n\nI am vegan, and I also come from a conservative southern family. I went veg at age 9 and vegan at 20. My uncles and cousins poke fun at me sometimes but would never be nasty about my choices. They\u2019re just like, \u201cWhat\u2019s in these cookies? Oh, flax seeds? What are those?\u201d with the occasional \u201cpinko hippy\u201d jest thrown in. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand being so angry about and personally offended by someone else\u2019s food choices, ESPECIALLY when those choices have a lower impact than one\u2019s own.

The recipe calls for a decadent frosting made with chocolate chips and silken tofu (don\u2019t knock it til you try it!). However, I usually make it with raspberry frosting (just fresh raspberries, vegetable shortening, and confectioner\u2019s sugar).\n\nEdit for grammar",
