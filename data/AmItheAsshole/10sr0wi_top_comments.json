I had a lot of responsibility young because of a parent's illness and my dad working a lot of overtime. I did some of this household management stuff as a teen and I didn't mind it-- my family needed it, my mom hadn't planned to get very ill. I even took a gap year to help while my mom was recovering. But when I started college, I moved out, and nobody gave me grief about it-- nobody in the family accused me of abandoning them because that is a NORMAL transition in life. If she had relapsed I would have taken a semester or two off because that would be extenuating circumstances, but normal jobs are NOT. Helping out when you're part of a family is fine, but it's your parents' responsibility to figure out how to balance work and home and maybe cut back on some hours if they need to, or ask the other adult children still living at home to pitch in if they aren't pursuing careers.",

Their nudging only made that happen one year sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t look back or regret your decision. (P.S. I&#39;m so impressed with your efficiency and just make-it-happen approach!) But also (I hope) harbor no ill-will to the family. The more you treat this as &quot;I was always going to eventually move out. It&#39;s just one year sooner than planned.&quot; the easier it will be for both them and you to not view the move as some big conflict.</p>\n\n<p>I do think your parents will need to address the fact that they can&#39;t just keep dividing the total chores among a shrinking number of children. It won&#39;t be sustainable.</p>\n</div>",

Why is it your child\u2019s responsibility to clean up after you? Why is the whole family\u2019s worth of dishes in the sink long enough that you need to tell a 10 year old to wash them??

Are they too lazy to do something if they aren\u2019t assigned that task? Is it some weird power play to not clean up after yourself because its assigned to another sibling to wash your dishes?? Its seriously just so fascinating to me that families legitimately just assign arbitrary tasks to each child instead of just teaching them to take care of themselves.

I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  \n\nBoth of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  \n\nMy dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  \n\nOver Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  \n\nMy parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  \n\nI went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  \n\nI packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  \n\nI'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  \n\nI just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  \n\nMy oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  \n\nMy parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  \n\nI'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    \n\nI feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The adults in your life should be doing a lot more than just providing money. You've have a crash course in managing a household so I imagine you're an incredibly responsible person. Please take care of yourself and your mental health.

It's 20 years later, and it still makes me panicky to think about it.\n\nOne of my punishments - I was 23 and living at home, which she had always said was allowed until we got our feet under us - for being unemployed was that I had to pay $50 a week in rent and do more chores because I was part of the household. Thankfully, I found something, and a few months later I was able to move out, but my life was absolutely miserable until then.

No one had done the dishes since I left. It took less than an hour of me being home for my mom to ask me to do them. Both sides of the sink were full.

But it was entertaining to hear them complain about the other not doing this or that cleaning thing and saying they don't have the time. Or talking about how much it sucks to feed the dogs in the cold during the winter. It's strange how it took their adult kids moving out for them to finally learn what being an adult responsible for your own household looks like.\n\n\nMy husband and I talk often about sharing household labor. I will never out my kids in the position I was in. Every night after dinner my parents and my brother would go watch TV together whil I had to stay in the kitchen and do the dishes from the day.
