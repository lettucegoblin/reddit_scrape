When she passed away last year and the Will was shared with the family, absolutely everything went to hell. We had attorneys and lawsuits and all kinds of shenanigans. I'm not overstating when I say the last year of my life has been the worst by far - and I've been through some shit. \n\nALL of that drama, and more importantly me being placed squarely in the middle of it, would have been avoided if my grandmother would have just told my mother ahead of time what her intentions were and why. Most of the damage between my parents and I will never be repaired, nor do I want them to be at this point. There's a point of no return in every kind of relationship, even with parents. \n\nI genuinely hope that you do not have a hard time with your father/step-mother when the day comes your grandparents' wishes have to be carried out. More importantly, I hope you have many, many more happy years with your grandparents.",

My uncle is helping my grandma with her estate and he\u2019s told me I\u2019ll be set but my mom is essentially using what would be her inheritance every time my grandma bails her out of credit card debt. \n\nGlad it worked out for you OP!

It has been trickling down to me and my two siblings, and my dad vaguely mentioned one year that when my grandmother passes that we'll each be getting a large chunk.\n\nHowever, my dad remarried years ago, and his new wife is very much \"what's in your family is also mine\", and she has 3 much older kids (like in their 40s) from a previous marriage. For example, when one of her kids had a child, it was my dad's \"first grandchild\". Pics of her kids are all over the house, and in a lot of places where me and my siblings' used to be. She's exceptionally bossy and I think she makes a lot of decisions in the household. She also really does not get along with my grandmother.

Sorry, can\u2019t talk now, love you, bye. \n\nNo sorry, can\u2019t come over this weekend to help fix the ~~lemon~~ car, too much to do.\n\nWhen the guilt tripping starts, hang up the phone or leave the area. If you can\u2019t leave, become only barely responsive \u2014 the noncommittal \u201cmm.\u201d is your new best friend. You just have to get that one fingernail exactly perfect and it takes you as long as they\u2019re still talking. The tree outside the window behind them is absolutely riveting and you simply don\u2019t have any focus to spare, except to say \u201cmm.\u201d every few moments. If they demand a response, \u201cthat sounds really difficult.\u201d or \u201csounds like you\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d \n\nNote the periods in all of these suggestions. Use that tone. The finality is important. \n\nAnd let the silence hang. Part of how guilt tripping works is by using the human need to fill the silence, to respond, especially when someone is feeling something negative. The best counterattack for when someone is using their own negative feelings as a weapon is to let them dwell on those feelings.\n\nAnother thing you can do is simply change the subject. Their dishwasher died? Oh that sucks. Hey I wonder if it\u2019s really going to snow tomorrow. Maybe we\u2019ll get a white Christmas this year after all. I hope it doesn\u2019t get so cold this year. Oh you\u2019re having to wash everything by hand now? Yeah that\u2019s rough. Maybe get some paper plates to tide you over until you can get a new one. So did you see the rest of that tv show we were talking about the other day? How\u2019d you like it?\n\nJust blandly acknowledge what they say so that they can\u2019t get mad at you for not listening, and then go on to other topics immediately. And ignore the little jabs, like when they mention dishwashers every other sentence in order to get you to buy them a new one so they\u2019ll shut up about it. Just make your escape as soon as you can, and find excuses for why you can\u2019t come back or talk on the phone for a while.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Be unavailable. When they start asking first say no, then if they keep on, discover that you have something you forgot or need to do. Sorry, can\u2019t talk now, love you, bye. </p>\n\n<p>No sorry, can\u2019t come over this weekend to help fix the <del>lemon</del> car, too much to do.</p>\n\n<p>When the guilt tripping starts, hang up the phone or leave the area. If you can\u2019t leave, become only barely responsive \u2014 the noncommittal \u201cmm.\u201d is your new best friend. You just have to get that one fingernail exactly perfect and it takes you as long as they\u2019re still talking. The tree outside the window behind them is absolutely riveting and you simply don\u2019t have any focus to spare, except to say \u201cmm.\u201d every few moments. If they demand a response, \u201cthat sounds really difficult.\u201d or \u201csounds like you\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Note the periods in all of these suggestions. Use that tone. The finality is important. </p>\n\n<p>And let the silence hang. Part of how guilt tripping works is by using the human need to fill the silence, to respond, especially when someone is feeling something negative. The best counterattack for when someone is using their own negative feelings as a weapon is to let them dwell on those feelings.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing you can do is simply change the subject. Their dishwasher died? Oh that sucks. Hey I wonder if it\u2019s really going to snow tomorrow. Maybe we\u2019ll get a white Christmas this year after all. I hope it doesn\u2019t get so cold this year. Oh you\u2019re having to wash everything by hand now? Yeah that\u2019s rough. Maybe get some paper plates to tide you over until you can get a new one. So did you see the rest of that tv show we were talking about the other day?

I'm fine with mom and dad being excluded, but to single out one grandchild as a way to dig in at the their son and their daughter-in-law is pretty gross behavior.  I could get if they didn't want it to be misused and so purposefully left the dad and step mom out and made the grandchild the executor of the trusts to make sure none went to dad and step mom, but this was a dick move on the grandparent's parts.

My MIL passed away a few years ago, she really didn't have a penny to her name but it was an accidental death so the $10k life insurance escalated to $100k. My wife was listed as the sole inheritor because her mom felt she was the most responsible and wanted her to use the money to cover stuff like death/funeral expenses. After all the expenses there was obviously alot more than my MIL had expected (90K+) so my wife just divided 4 ways between the 4 kids and told them to divided their portion up however they saw fit between themselves and their kids . 1 Sister was irate and felt like she deserved more because she had help out the MIL on occasion (they live in the same town, while 1 sister is not all there and my wife and 1 brother live out of state).

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Money makes people stupid. My MIL passed away a few years ago, she really didn&#39;t have a penny to her name but it was an accidental death so the $10k life insurance escalated to $100k. My wife was listed as the sole inheritor because her mom felt she was the most responsible and wanted her to use the money to cover stuff like death/funeral expenses. After all the expenses there was obviously alot more than my MIL had expected (90K+) so my wife just divided 4 ways between the 4 kids and told them to divided their portion up however they saw fit between themselves and their kids . 1 Sister was irate and felt like she deserved more because she had help out the MIL on occasion (they live in the same town, while 1 sister is not all there and my wife and 1 brother live out of state). They haven&#39;t spoken since (going on 2 years now). So short story even if you divide up money in a way most normal people would find &#39;fair&#39; (equal shares) some people still going to feel like they deserve moar.</p>\n</div>",

I know people aged everywhere from their 20s to their 70s who would have their lives changed permanently by 75k, myself included because with that amount i could go to school and get a job that allows me to have a higher standard of living and to save for retirement myself instead of needing someone else's money for it.
