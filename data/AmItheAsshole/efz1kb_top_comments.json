So, slowly over the course of 8 years, I went from 80KGs (176.3 pounds) up to 107 KGs (235.9 pounds). I work in a foundry, making moulds from sand, melting metal, swinging 14 pound sledgehammers for a couple hours every morning, to using a 230mm (9\u201d) grinder for hours a day. I\u2019d sweat heaps and work hard all day everyday, but I still put on weight. Over the last year, I\u2019ve been to the doctors a lot, had my health examined, blood work done and MRIs taken, turns out I had a brain tumor in my pituitary gland that was over producing prolactin. This hormone causes low libido, weight gain and lactation, it\u2019s not a necessary hormone in men, and I was self conscious about my low libido and large man boobs and the fact that, I as a male, was lactating. Since I\u2019ve been on medication to shrink the tumor and a low carb diet to watch my weight, I\u2019ve dropped 40KGs (88 pounds). I am no longer lactating, my breast tissue has shrunk considerably, though their still big and noticeable, I am much happier. My doctor thinks this absurdly large weight loss over 12 months is border line dangerous, but all my physical exams have come back great, and the weight loss is slowing down immensely, that past few weeks I\u2019ve stabilised and I now weigh 67 KGs (147.7 pounds) and I am so much healthier and happier than I used to be. I hate fat shaming of all sorts, and your step sister deserved what she got. It\u2019s about time she got some of her own abuse thrown back at her, though I do think you went a little overboard, I can understand that you just snapped and let fly. I would make a small effort to apologise later, but give it a couple weeks to a month to let your emotions settle down. Maybe write a small letter explaining how you feel and post it to her and your parents. Make sure to detail everything she put you through and how your one outburst pales in comparison to years of mental torture and emotional abuse. You could even turn this into a r/pettyrevenge story, by posting your letter, to hers and/or your social media and having all her friends and coworkers find out just what kind of person she really is.\n\nEdit: Your age has nothing to do with abuse. You\u2019ve been the better person for years, never biting back or retaliating.\n\nEdit2: grammar.",

I work in a foundry, making moulds from sand, melting metal, swinging 14 pound sledgehammers for a couple hours every morning, to using a 230mm (9\u201d) grinder for hours a day. I\u2019d sweat heaps and work hard all day everyday, but I still put on weight. Over the last year, I\u2019ve been to the doctors a lot, had my health examined, blood work done and MRIs taken, turns out I had a brain tumor in my pituitary gland that was over producing prolactin. This hormone causes low libido, weight gain and lactation, it\u2019s not a necessary hormone in men, and I was self conscious about my low libido and large man boobs and the fact that, I as a male, was lactating. Since I\u2019ve been on medication to shrink the tumor and a low carb diet to watch my weight, I\u2019ve dropped 40KGs (88 pounds). I am no longer lactating, my breast tissue has shrunk considerably, though their still big and noticeable, I am much happier. My doctor thinks this absurdly large weight loss over 12 months is border line dangerous, but all my physical exams have come back great, and the weight loss is slowing down immensely, that past few weeks I\u2019ve stabilised and I now weigh 67 KGs (147.7 pounds) and I am so much healthier and happier than I used to be. I hate fat shaming of all sorts, and your step sister deserved what she got. It\u2019s about time she got some of her own abuse thrown back at her, though I do think you went a little overboard, I can understand that you just snapped and let fly. I would make a small effort to apologise later, but give it a couple weeks to a month to let your emotions settle down. Maybe write a small letter explaining how you feel and post it to her and your parents. Make sure to detail everything she put you through and how your one outburst pales in comparison to years of mental torture and emotional abuse. You could even turn this into a <a href=\"/r/pettyrevenge\">r/pettyrevenge</a> story, by posting your letter, to hers and/or your social media and having all her friends and coworkers find out just what kind of person she really is.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Your age has nothing to do with abuse. You\u2019ve been the better person for years, never biting back or retaliating.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: grammar.</p>\n</div>",

Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.\n\nWhen I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was \"cooler\" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like \"fatass\" and \"chubster\". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset?  \nI got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips.  \nAt 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).\n\nBy the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, \"He's still pretty big\", \"Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness\", \"Maybe lose a little more around that gut\". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.\n\nNow here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, \"Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?\" I flipped out. I yelled, \"Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?\"  \nShe said back to me, \"Defensive much?\"   \n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?\" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. \"Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!\"  \nShe started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, \"Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!\"  \n\"But you're way older!\" she whined.\n\nI left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dumb parenting</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m just going to also add: why parent doesn\u2019t want to have a good kid? Why does a parent put up with their kid being so rude? It\u2019s so much nicer for all your mom friends to come up to you and say that your kid is so sweet and well behaved. If not because you genuinely want to bring up your kids well, just do it for the bragging rights.</p>\n</div>",
