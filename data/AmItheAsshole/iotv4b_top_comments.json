Hopefully you guys did this official when you adopted Lucy and not just verbal because looks like your sister thinks she can play dolls with your family (ie: put all the responsibility on you and tell you how to be/raise a family to her liking, your opinions don&#39;t matter to her). You should make sure she knows her place.</p>\n</div>",

I'm guessing the adoption was legal (as in, no father protesting/wanting his kid)? Was it a race issue (which would make your ex a complete a-hole)? So weird.~~ Edited since this was answered in a comment (seems awfully far fetched to me). \n\n> When I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time\n\nWhy did you even act like she got a say? She doesn't and never did. Neither did Lucy. Why even consult her?\n\nHaving your sister there weighing in like she has parental rights/any kind of input (and grilling Lucy about a sibling) might be confusing to Lucy regardless of the sabotage. You need to have better boundaries (they should have already been in place).

The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.\n\nWhen Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.\n\nWhen I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.\n\nMy sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.\n\nShe keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.\n\nWe had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said \"auntie keeps turning the wifi off\". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.\n\nWhen we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone \"forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter\" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.\n\nSince leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Its possible she&#39;s remembering that she used to get priority on things when you were a baby &amp; she&#39;s projecting a little.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s crossed a line by not listening to what Lucy wants though &amp; I&#39;d be concerned as to what else she might do, especially give her previous tendency to tell people what she knows they want to hear (Lucy&#39;s pre-birth description, yes I&#39;m fine with the idea of siblings).

You remind me of the people who told us that home schooling would make her socially awkward. She&#39;s not the least bit socially hampered. She has plenty of cousins and has no problem making friends. You can&#39;t tell how every case goes based on others. She literally just said she&#39;s glad she doesn&#39;t have siblings. If people want multiple kids, or one kid, or no kids, that&#39;s great. But who are you to judge. That&#39;s one of the problems with our society. Too many judgy people.</p>\n</div>",
