When I worked in fast food a guy used to come in and if he couldn\u2019t see me he\u2019d ask another worker if I was in that day. Even at 15 they understood that it was creepy and invasive, and on more than one occasion told him I wasn\u2019t on when I was just out the back. They always told me when this happened so I knew what was going on. Report your manager, because that is a huge safety violation which could have gotten you stalked, harassed or assaulted. Her crocodile tears wouldn\u2019t save you from a potentially dangerous situation</p>\n</div>",

Because she used to be a nurse at an all women\u2019s prison in Michigan, she knew how to quickly break away and did so. We later found out that they were human traffickers targeting middle aged to elderly women. \n\nI fear that this could be the potential case, but knowing how wild my imagination goes I hope it\u2019s just paranoia.\n\nEdit: this may have been on local news because the police found the perps 1 hour later after the whole ordeal and I did fail to mentioned that she had 3 dogs with her at the time and one of them bit the low life in the Achilles heel to protect her. After my mother got all the dogs back in the car, she sat there for a minute and called a family friend completely confused as to what had happened. He then asked her why is she calling him first instead of the police. She proceeds to do so and started describing the guy wearing a heavy parka (it was early November and was about 40 to 50 degrees F) and drove a tan pickup that was rusting to all hell and mentioned about the dog bite incident with them.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>In November 2019, my mother was leaving a Starbucks when some guy grabbed her. Because she used to be a nurse at an all women\u2019s prison in Michigan, she knew how to quickly break away and did so. We later found out that they were human traffickers targeting middle aged to elderly women. </p>\n\n<p>I fear that this could be the potential case, but knowing how wild my imagination goes I hope it\u2019s just paranoia.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this may have been on local news because the police found the perps 1 hour later after the whole ordeal and I did fail to mentioned that she had 3 dogs with her at the time and one of them bit the low life in the Achilles heel to protect her. After my mother got all the dogs back in the car, she sat there for a minute and called a family friend completely confused as to what had happened. He then asked her why is she calling him first instead of the police.
