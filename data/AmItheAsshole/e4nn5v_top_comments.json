I hope your husband is on board with her being banned from your home.  \n\n\nIf you need to respond to any of your inlaws (other than her, she'll just keep lying), let them know calmly what happened (try to express only your hurt, not your anger).

The most charitable option is to believe she is an airhead, which means her judgment cannot be trusted alone in your space.  The least charitable (and most likely, in my opinion) is that she is a manipulative and malicious person who wants to both hurt you, and make you look irrational.  Tell them an expensive and likely irreplaceable item was damaged, and to prevent further accidents or hurt, you've decided it's best for family events to be hosted at someone else's home.  I completely understand your anger, and think you and your husband are entitled to it, but I think it might be a good idea to respond to her manipulation more carefully so as not to let her make all the rest of your in laws think you're the crazy one.
