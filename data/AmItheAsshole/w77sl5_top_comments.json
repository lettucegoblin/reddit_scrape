This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nI'll start this off by saying that I, f32 have been with my husband Bob, m39 for 3 years, married for one. His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of \"you work too much\". Not true because sometimes I do make myself available but yet find myself excluded. \n\nLast week. His mom invited us for a celebratory dinner at the restaurant after she completed her recovery. I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I'd be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. \n\nThing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chair had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. \n\nI was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom was watched with their eyes popping out of their head like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. \n\nI had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way put. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront if her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn't his nor his mom's fault guests arrived \"before\" me and took all the available chairs.

His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of &quot;you work too much&quot;. Not true because sometimes I do make myself available but yet find myself excluded. </p>\n\n<p>Last week. His mom invited us for a celebratory dinner at the restaurant after she completed her recovery. I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I&#39;d be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. </p>\n\n<p>Thing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chair had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. </p>\n\n<p>I was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom was watched with their eyes popping out of their head like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. </p>\n\n<p>I had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way put. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront if her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn&#39;t his nor his mom&#39;s fault guests arrived &quot;before&quot; me and took all the available chairs. I told him he could&#39;ve saved me a chair!!!!!. he said that I could&#39;ve just left instead, And reminded me that I was a guest&quot; and that I shouldn&#39;t expect this level of entitlement to be &quot;accepted&quot;.

They often use incremental changes to get what they want slowly and so that you are less likely to notice. \nThe Book \"why does he do that\" by Lundy Bancroft (free copy below) is a great resource for you to learn about the different types of tactics that abusers use and will help you to see if your current relationship is following any of the patterns described.\n If you don't see your relationship being discussed either as one of the architypes or as bits and pieces of any of the other types then you're not worse off by having the knowledge.  If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.\n I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see.
