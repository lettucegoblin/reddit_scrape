I swear i'm smarter than this made me sound haha\n\nAs an American, most guys I know whether from their 50s to their 20s are circumcised. It's just old fashioned ideas that are so built into the culture it's never questioned imo. I'm not a parent but when I first got married I really wanted kids and did tons of reading. It was only then (online and in some books) I really understood circumcision, and my husband and I came to the decision we wouldn't do that if we had kids. He doesn't resent his parents but he does wish he hadn't had it done to him as his was a little botched, not to an extreme degree but still. but no one I knew ever talked about it really, so I had no idea until I began to read all the child related material. and that's the situation for many parents right now\n\ni remember when I began to talk to my mom about what I read, she told me about having to get that done with my older brother and being there with the doctor, while she's holding her little baby down while he's screaming, it actually was traumatic for her and some thing that she really regrets. My mother in law also regrets it and cried telling me about her experience with it. But it's just what everyone at that time was doing. \n\nanyway sorry to ramble lol, my point being that here in America we definitely need to speak up about it and spread education. And along those lines, not call parents who did circumcise their babies assholes or other derogatory names. that isn't gonna do anything but possibly make other parents less likely to ask questions.",

Cancer is just a cruel and random disease. It isn&#39;t a battle. Cancer is like a suicide attack, it tries to take you down which will also ultimately kill itself, it&#39;s random and you can&#39;t do much to stop it, but sometimes there&#39;s survivors. But people who die from cancer didn&#39;t die because they didn&#39;t fight hard enough. I&#39;m so sorry about your mom. Sending you internet hugs from another cancer patient.</p>\n</div>",
