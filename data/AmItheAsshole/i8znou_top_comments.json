She had already dumped each of her three children on whomever was nearest at hand in her search for yet another meal ticket so... yeah.  I grew up spending more and more time with them (my mother was maternal only in the sense that she gave birth) and was hurt by how little interest he had in my actual person and feelings.  I noted that he doted on her, catered to her, and would move the stars to keep her from sulking but my actual *needs* we're an inconvenience best ignored.  I once made the mistake of asking him how he could place anyone so far above his only child and this was his response: \"She is my WIFE.  She will be in my life forever.  You're going to grow up and get married but SHE will always be with me.  When you have a family of your own you'll understand.\"  \n\nI don't know if your father ever voiced this to you but it sounds like he absolutely *thought* it.  \n\nNow you have grown up.  You have a spouse and a child of your own and (hopefully) you know just how wrong that sentiment is.  And he is, contrary to his plan, without the woman he chose and catered to.

I&#39;m going to share a personal experience not because it&#39;s the same but because I think it might clarify your situation and maybe bring you comfort in your decision, if not his. </p>\n\n<p>When I was young my father remarried a woman who... well, let&#39;s just shorthand it to say she likely wouldn&#39;t have married him if she&#39;d known he would start asking for more visitation once he had a wife.  She had already dumped each of her three children on whomever was nearest at hand in her search for yet another meal ticket so... yeah.  I grew up spending more and more time with them (my mother was maternal only in the sense that she gave birth) and was hurt by how little interest he had in my actual person and feelings.  I noted that he doted on her, catered to her, and would move the stars to keep her from sulking but my actual <em>needs</em> we&#39;re an inconvenience best ignored.  I once made the mistake of asking him how he could place anyone so far above his only child and this was his response: &quot;She is my WIFE.  She will be in my life forever.  You&#39;re going to grow up and get married but SHE will always be with me.  When you have a family of your own you&#39;ll understand.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if your father ever voiced this to you but it sounds like he absolutely <em>thought</em> it.  </p>\n\n<p>Now you have grown up.  You have a spouse and a child of your own and (hopefully) you know just how wrong that sentiment is.  And he is, contrary to his plan, without the woman he chose and catered to.  This is not your fault.  </p>\n\n<p>He made his choice.  </p>\n\n<p>You protect yours.</p>\n</div>",

He lived in an apartment less than 5 minutes from where I was staying with my mom, and she used to literally have to BEG him to spend time with me.

They will guilt trip and whine about being mistreated but, when confronted with their transgressions, will make all sorts of excuses and call it a mistake, but never apologize. They do absolutely nothing to correct the situation and try to guilt trip the kids and gaslight them about their behavior.\n\nMy dad, who chose to abandon us when I was 13 because we neglected to answer a letter he sent after 2 weeks (during the busy first few days of school starting.) He wrote us off with a \"Happy Thanksgiving, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year\", and did nothing more than call us once a year on Christmas for years. He only came around again when my brother got married because he wanted to play proud father. When he got older, he just couldn't understand why we didn't run to his side every time he wrote us a 5 page letter about how much he was suffering and how it was all our fault. I had an on/off relationship with him our whole lives because he acted like he was father of the year and we had no right to be angry or distant. This is from a guy who was so selfish that he used the savings bonds we kids had to buy himself a shot gun. He was also given some silver quarters by his mother to give to us ($10 each face value) and he scammed us by paying us $10 for them. Yet, he was the victim. NTA",

They will only interact when they have nothing left, so they expect their neglected children to pick up the pieces. They will guilt trip and whine about being mistreated but, when confronted with their transgressions, will make all sorts of excuses and call it a mistake, but never apologize. They do absolutely nothing to correct the situation and try to guilt trip the kids and gaslight them about their behavior.</p>\n\n<p>My dad, who chose to abandon us when I was 13 because we neglected to answer a letter he sent after 2 weeks (during the busy first few days of school starting.) He wrote us off with a &quot;Happy Thanksgiving, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year&quot;, and did nothing more than call us once a year on Christmas for years. He only came around again when my brother got married because he wanted to play proud father. When he got older, he just couldn&#39;t understand why we didn&#39;t run to his side every time he wrote us a 5 page letter about how much he was suffering and how it was all our fault. I had an on/off relationship with him our whole lives because he acted like he was father of the year and we had no right to be angry or distant. This is from a guy who was so selfish that he used the savings bonds we kids had to buy himself a shot gun. He was also given some silver quarters by his mother to give to us ($10 each face value) and he scammed us by paying us $10 for them. Yet, he was the victim. NTA</p>\n</div>",

And he's going to know it's okay to be single. Bonus, if you wait as long as I have, he's going to critically look at the relationships around him and spot the toxic ones pretty well. At least that's what my kids do. Plus, you guys will be really close and it will be your decision what morals and values to impart on him.\n\nBeing a single mom can suck sometimes but it's a lot better than a lot of the relationships I've seen between blended families.

Once I got mad enough,  I no longer cared about consequences.   Had pretty severe anger issues growing up.   On the plus side,  learning control that has given me good bit of self control.   Takes a lot to provoke me anymore.  I mean,  I'm still not going to take any shit from anyone,  but I'm a lot less likely to escalate the situation to a physical confrontation.   An especially useful feature after I became a legal adult,  heh.",
