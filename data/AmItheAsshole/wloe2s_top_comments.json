It's not something that bodes well for working out a future together.  \n\n**You have addressed this multiple times with her.**  She keeps on going back to it, knowing how it bothers you, knowing that it makes it difficult for you to know what she really means.  She's doing it on purpose.  She knows that this upsets you, and keeps on doing it.  \n\n**I think you did the only thing you could have done.**  You walked away from a situation where she made it very clear that she wasn't going to consider you and your needs, only her own wants.  She did this in a time and place and in front of people where she thought she could get away with it and you would have to \"take it\". \n\n**Her behavior was that of manipulators,** people who are teaching us that they want to be in control over us.\n\nIf she loved you, she would stop doing this \"joke\" that she knows isn't a joke to you, simply because it distresses you.\n\n*She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke.*\n\nThis is more manipulation.  **She's blaming you, for what she did.**  That's not just manipulation, it's abuse.  \n\n**It's not a joke.**   She calls it a joke, but it's not a joke.  \n\nThe situation was uncomfortable, not because you left, but because **she did something to you that hurt you, again, knowing it would hurt you,** and she did it during that moment.  She did it in front of other people, thinking she would get away with it and you would have to \"take it\" to be polite, to \"be nice.\"  This is manipulation, purely manipulation. \n\n**The situation was difficult because of her behavior, not yours.**\n\n**You did the right thing.  You protected yourself from her bad behavior.**  \n\n**If she cared, she would be apologizing to you, accepting responsibility for her wrong behavior, and getting herself some help to change her behavior.  Instead, she's blaming you for objecting to her wrong behavior.**  That's abuse.  \n\n*my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.*\n\nThey support her, when she does something that she knows hurts you.  **They aren't people you can trust to do the right thing.  Neither is she.  She knew it was wrong, knew it would hurt you, and she did it anyway.**  If she will do this, at such a moment, what else will she do if you marry her?  How else will she hurt you?  **You did the right thing, protecting yourself from her hurting you yet again.**  \n\nYou didn't humiliate her.  You protected yourself.  She humiliated herself, by doing this hurtful thing to you.  AGAIN.  \n\nPlease keep on protecting yourself.  You deserve someone who will truly love you, not hurt you repeatedly, and then blame you when you object.",

She&#39;s doing it on purpose.  She knows that this upsets you, and keeps on doing it.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>I think you did the only thing you could have done.</strong>  You walked away from a situation where she made it very clear that she wasn&#39;t going to consider you and your needs, only her own wants.  She did this in a time and place and in front of people where she thought she could get away with it and you would have to &quot;take it&quot;. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Her behavior was that of manipulators,</strong> people who are teaching us that they want to be in control over us.</p>\n\n<p>If she loved you, she would stop doing this &quot;joke&quot; that she knows isn&#39;t a joke to you, simply because it distresses you.</p>\n\n<p><em>She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is more manipulation.  <strong>She&#39;s blaming you, for what she did.</strong>  That&#39;s not just manipulation, it&#39;s abuse.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#39;s not a joke.</strong>   She calls it a joke, but it&#39;s not a joke.  </p>\n\n<p>The situation was uncomfortable, not because you left, but because <strong>she did something to you that hurt you, again, knowing it would hurt you,</strong> and she did it during that moment.  She did it in front of other people, thinking she would get away with it and you would have to &quot;take it&quot; to be polite, to &quot;be nice.&quot;  This is manipulation, purely manipulation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The situation was difficult because of her behavior, not yours.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You did the right thing.  You protected yourself from her bad behavior.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>If she cared, she would be apologizing to you, accepting responsibility for her wrong behavior, and getting herself some help to change her behavior.  Instead, she&#39;s blaming you for objecting to her wrong behavior.</strong>  That&#39;s abuse.  </p>\n\n<p><em>my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.</em></p>\n\n<p>They support her, when she does something that she knows hurts you.  <strong>They aren&#39;t people you can trust to do the right thing.  Neither is she.  She knew it was wrong, knew it would hurt you, and she did it anyway.</strong>  If she will do this, at such a moment, what else will she do if you marry her?  How else will she hurt you?  <strong>You did the right thing, protecting yourself from her hurting you yet again.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>You didn&#39;t humiliate her.  You protected yourself.  She humiliated herself, by doing this hurtful thing to you.  AGAIN.  </p>\n\n<p>Please keep on protecting yourself.  You deserve someone who will truly love you, not hurt you repeatedly, and then blame you when you object.</p>\n</div>",

It consists of her saying \"No\" quickly to anything I ask.\n\n I know it sounds silly, but I ask her to get a glass of water for me, she says no and after 1 minute, I'm almost getting up, she says she's joking and gets some water. I ask her to wash the dishes, she says no.... I say I LOVE YOU, she says no... I ask her to take her clothes, she says no. Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is \"addicted\" to doing it.\n\n I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me). And there are things that are serious and I need her to answer seriously. And if she says no to everything jokingly, I can't tell when she's saying a real no (it's already happened). \n\nI keep saying this is boring and I don't like it, she stops doing it and goes back to doing it after a week. After a brief discussion because she played this prank in front of our friends (Me asking \"love, can you get me some medicine?\" and she with No kidding), she stopped doing it for 1 month. \n\nYesterday, we welcomed my parents, in-laws and our 2 best friends to our house. Everyone knew that I was going to propose to her and I called them, because we always planned this proposal with our loved ones attending, participating in this special day. \n\nI asked her to marry me and she said a quick NO and I was so grumpy/panic/upset (everyone looking in shock) for 30s for her to laugh and say she was joking, finally saying YES. \n\nI was so embarrassed and\u2026disappointed? I put the ring box back in and said I'd take it out to cool off. I didn't even let her say anything. \n\nShe kept texting me (no answering calls), saying it was just a joke and that I knew she always did that. She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke. \n\nWell, I slept in a hotel and I'm still in it. \n\nMy parents supported me, but my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.\n\n I just really think there's time for jokes and that moment wasn't clearly, she knew I didn't like it and decided to do it anyway. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yeah right.Eventually i lost all respect and ended the relationship after 2.5 years. I couldnt and wouldnt take him seriously and quite frankly the disrespect towards me was making me feel grossed out by him. Emotionally and physically.

Coming at this from an autism angle, I\u2019ve had periods where I obsessively tell the same \u201cjoke\u201d over and over again, or make the same comment as a knee-jerk response to a setup, and it wouldn\u2019t really matter if it annoyed other people or even ME, because I couldn\u2019t stop it.
