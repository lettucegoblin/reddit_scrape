She was blatantly racist, and literally her only reason for DEHUMANISING you was \"aesthetics\".

So again: what possible, reasonable justification could there be for asking you to show her any kindness or compassion at all. She clearly has none for you, and *her entire upset isn't even that she is ashamed of being racist, but that she is ashamed that people know about it*. So she hasn't even learned anything from any of this; certainly not empathy or compassion. \n\nAnd just for argument's sake, say you hadn't seen the message. Did she think that months from now, paging through wedding albums with your boyfriend's family, or visiting her and seeing framed photos, that you wouldn't notice that you'd been COMPLETELY PHOTOSHOPPED OUT of group photos that you'd posed for? Or that she wouldn't have to explain?\n\nNope. All she's seeing are reasonable consequences for her own hateful behaviour.

She\u2019s my long term boyfriend\u2019s (m32) sister. They\u2019re white and I\u2019m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn\u2019t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who\u2019s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over \u20ac 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend.

The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don\u2019t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she\u2019s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I\u2019m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she\u2019s in. \n\nI texted back are you kidding me?\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded in rage when I did it but even now I\u2019m calm I still don\u2019t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this.

To this day she\u2019s the only person I ever knew who could go toe to toe with me in fighting games.</p>\n</div>",

Negative and positive stereotypes and ideologies that are spread and reinforced by one's community as well as the entertainment industry, advertising, etc. Since everyone is exposed to those ideas and has theoretically internalized at least some of them, what matters is not how you think, but how you act and communicate. Discriminating vs. non-discriminating. Especially after you're made aware that it's wrong.\n\nI kind of wish \"racist\" had not become such a strong word. \nIt draws a direct connection between racism and being a fundamentally bad person. Using it causes that denial reflex and makes it harder to openly discuss, learn, and grow. You can't fix a problem when you pretend it doesn't exist. Sure, if a person is aware and still chooses to behave and speak that way (OP's SIL), then by all means, expose them. But jumping straight to writing someone off as racist doesn't acknowledge that racism is rampant and that an individual can make progress despite it. And it doesn't allow room for those who are in the process of learning and trying to actively change but may stumble due to naivete. Obviously it's not an excuse, and it's not any given person's responsibility to educate them, but I think we should be a little more forgiving so people aren't so scared to talk about it and possibly make mistakes.\n\nMy question is if OP's boyfriend isn't respecting her enough as a person to take her word that something is racist.",

Discrimination is a part of our existence as brown people and it sucks. When this conversation comes up elsewhere, if later down the line, let&#39;s say years into the future you&#39;re married and something worse happens at work or outside or in a parking lot or at a gas station, is he going to &quot;uncomfortably&quot; step outside of the conflict again and dismiss it all away again? Leaving you to fight for your right to exist alone? Sounds like a nightmare to find yourself in where you expected a partner. Your kids won&#39;t be benefited by this either. \nConditional acceptance and conditional support in your existence is not okay. That is the bare minimum. Being dark skinned and discriminated against is part of your life that he should easily be vehement about defending you from. Not ignore it and dismiss it for his &quot;comfort.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like confronting racism in the world is too &quot;uncomfortable&quot; for him, but somehow he still wants to be dating you without admitting that&#39;s a problem in the world. That sucks and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re dealing with that.</p>\n</div>",
