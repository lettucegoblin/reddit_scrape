I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Unless maybe it came from a genuinely concerned parent, spouse, close friend with an empathetic approach and familiarity with their situation). But the problem occurs when people start thinking that they have the right to just make offhand remarks and shame acquaintances/strangers\u2014as if their diet gives them some kind of moral high ground. There is no moral high ground in choosing healthier life choices\u2014it is all in your own best self-interest. People (like OPs coworker) hide behind the excuse that they\u2019re actually concerned for a person\u2019s health to give them a free pass at commenting on someone else\u2019s body or diet.</p>\n</div>",

It's not called that but they are genuinely putting lots of deliberately different people in their ads - a couple they're running at the moment has a mum and child in a bikini and the mum has a new mum tum (unlike the usual models) and a pale skinned red haired woman who has huge brown freckles over her body and they are portrayed in a positive light like the usual models.

It would be as well to include in that account the record over a number of days that has happened before. Blowing up at work always causes trouble for the one who blew up - no matter what the provocation - so to minimise the blowback, I'd suggest the OP be prepared for trouble and have a full and historical account of what has been going on in case their worker takes it to the next level.\n\nNot only should OP get the same respect that her co-worker obviously expects for herself, but her efforts to eat healthily and remain healthy are highly commendable.
