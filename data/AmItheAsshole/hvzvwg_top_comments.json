You&#39;re life partners FFS. You&#39;re the mother of his child.</p>\n\n<p>He should not have been looking the other way whilst his friend has been racist towards you.He should have believed you when you loooked like you were in pain. And he should NEVER have declined his heavily pregnant partner&#39;s phone call.</p>\n\n<p>If a friend is being an AH towards my SO? They won&#39;t be a friend for long. Ditto for SO.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe she wants him, or maybe she&#39;s just one of those friends who can&#39;t stand when their friend gets a partner and they don&#39;t have that friend&#39;s attention any more - but she&#39;s been unfair to you. And that&#39;s on top of the racism.</p>\n\n<p>This all sounds like a lot of stress, and perhaps some relationship or individual counselling might help you process it all and work out how to communicate and work together to parent. You don&#39;t have to decide whether to forgive him or take him back, now. But he is still the parent of your child. Take time, look after yourself and your baby and surround yourself with people who support you.</p>\n</div>",

You  actually sent this text to his best girl friend and didn&#39;t tell him about it and then went to a hangout with her??</p>\n\n<p>Those are never talking to or seeing this person again kind of words and apparently Michael didn&#39;t even know you felt this way or sent this?</p>\n\n<p>I mean that is what mature communication is all about. If there is someone so toxic that they will never be allowed near your child then that is the end,  You break off all ties and never see them again immediately. If your husband is unaware of this yet you are speaking for him then you have a serious issue with communication. If somehow your husband know that this person is someone so toxic that you felt this way but then somehow this text was a surprise then he is insane.</p>\n</div>",

Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only \"friend\" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\\*\\*\\*\\* and a c\\*\\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\\*\\*\\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.\n\nAITA for not wanting to forgive him??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
