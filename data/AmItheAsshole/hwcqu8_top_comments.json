She just looks up to you and I find it even cute. </p>\n\n<p>Tell you parents to chill as you could\u2019ve snapped a picture of a fake tattoo :D</p>\n</div>",

She doesn't want to be mimicked 100% on every detail, that's her right as an individual person. Then we have the adults who are demanding OP give up her self identity and chop off her hair because her sister chose too. That's mental abuse. If she wants to help guide her sister, then that's great! However it's not her responsibility. \n\nTo op, You have a right to existence, you have a right to your own unique expressions. You should not have to cut your hair because your sister as an individual made a choice.\nShe looked you in the eyes and lied herself claiming \"coincidences\". She's not 3,6,10, or 13.

Did this probably hurt her feelings maybe a little bit but your emotions shouldn't be ignored considering your feeling overshadowed. I've been in a similar situation and mentally it killed me.

        "body": "NTA. This was brilliant and ultimately harmless, even if your sister is annoyed and feeling dumb right now. I (25f) deal with the exact same shit from my younger sister (21f) and have for years, and it is completely infuriating. The speech patterns and gestures/body language can\u2019t be helped to some extent, because that naturally happens between family members (I catch myself sounding just like my mom all the time), but the repeated aesthetic/style/lifestyle copying is completely a choice on her part. With me and my sis... I got a rib tattoo, and she got a rib tattoo. I pierced my nose, she pierced her nose. I love Tyler the Creator/Odd Future (have for years) and wear Tyler\u2019s brand Golfwang, and all of a sudden (after seeing me in a hoodie I got) my sister \u201cloved\u201d Golfwang too, despite the fact that she learned about Tyler for the first time after asking me what brand I was wearing. I get a pair of sneakers, she gets the same pair of sneakers. She goes to the same small college that I did, and declared the same niche major. It sounds kind of silly, but the last straw was her getting her septum pierced after I got mine pierced, so we both have the double nose piercing. I love my sister and we are really close, and I appreciate that she looks up to me, but it\u2019s irritating as shit that she has such difficulty doing her own thing. This is a boundaries issue. Your younger sis wants to be sister-twins, and you don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s important to frame it as such (a boundaries issue). It\u2019s important to respect other people\u2019s boundaries.\n\nI think your hair prank was an amazing way to reveal and confront this issue, and ultimately will be good for your sister, as I suspect she\u2019ll find that she actually likes the haircut, which will show her that it is possible to take pride in how she looks without having to \u201cmatch\u201d with you. I think it finally started to click with my sister when I sat her down and talked about the importance of developing her own style, and the importance of being confident in how SHE acts and looks as an independent person. I stressed that it\u2019s important that everyone have the chance to explore their OWN path, and that includes older sisters who are figuring out their lives too and don\u2019t want to be copied (lol). Maybe talking to her about the issue this way could help (using an extra loving/encouraging tone instead of an angry/annoyed one, even though you\u2019re entitled to the latter). Your sister is totally unique, with her own special gifts (even if she doesn\u2019t see them right now) and that\u2019s amazing. Anything you can do to shift her focus to HER strengths will help build her confidence to try her own thing. \n\nI do think this is partially a maturity issue that will fade at least a little with time (it\u2019s definitely improved since my sister has entered her 20s), but it\u2019s annoying asf to feel infringed upon in that way and then be gaslit/dismissed by your family about it. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re still at college physically - obviously covid has thrown a wrench in things, assuming you\u2019re in the US - but being away from my sister physically and generally entering young adulthood when she was still a teenager meant our styles naturally diverged. Your age difference is large enough that I suspect this will happen for you too. I work an office job (and spent most my waking hours there before I started working from home) so i stopped buying as many crop tops (lol) and started investing in turtlenecks and trousers. My sister had no reason to buy (or wear) business professional blazers, so she stopped copying my clothes as much, for both financial and social reasons (lol). My sis is still in college, so her clothing needs are just different from mine. As you enter a different chapter in your life, I think you\u2019ll see a similar divergence. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what your life trajectory is, but I want to reiterate that no matter where you end up (proximity, career, whatever), you forcing her to adopt an independent style here was, is, and will continue to be good for her. It\u2019s not healthy for younger siblings to religiously follow the footsteps of their older siblings at the expense of their own personal development and identity. Ignore your parents. In a way, you forcing your sister\u2019s hand was an act of love, albeit \u201ctough\u201d love in her eyes. The long term consequences of this will only be positive. I feel for you, have been there, and am still there (albeit less often, thankfully).",

I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are splitting images of each other.\n\n\nHonestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??\n\n\nI have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.\n\n\nOne afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. \n\n\nI received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.\n\n\nI went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. \n\n\nShe was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.\n\n\nOur parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place).

We're close in age and so wewere often in the same age groups for activities. But she would copy me so much. It was so hard to have my own identity or do my own thing.\n\nI have been trying to clean out my room and have found some old diaries that I kept very sporadically, but a fairly common motif was \"my sister gets everything I want when I finally get it and spent so long begging.\"\nI had to beg for months to get my ears pierced, my sister decided she wanted them while I was in the chair, and she got them that day. I got my hair cut into a bob, and then she wanted a haircut and all the way the I made her promise over and over not to copy me. The hairdresser ended up calling me over to model my haircut for her. The list goes on. Fortunately this didn't last forever, and she got over this phase by the time we were in high school. \n\nIf you look a lot alike, odds are a lot of the same things will look good on you both, so I could see this happening occasionally,  but I completely understand your pain. It's not that the idea to get something just happened to come from her sister time to time- she actively wanted this style because you had it, otherwise she wouldn't be mad that you didn't actually do it (maybe at the lying part, but still, it's something she wanted to confirm first that you actually cut and dyed it) your parents wouldn't insist you chop it to match. \n\nYour sister is 16, and not much older than I was when I wrote an entry I made about my sister getting to come to dragoncon when I need to go with my parents for years and years, and once I'm going she decides she wants to go. So while I think that you're justified in being upset and her only motivation was to look like you (with a super distinctive style that she doesn't independently like!) - I don't think I can bring myself to say that she's TA.\n\nLike a lot of commentors, I'm here wondering \"Wtf is with your parents?\" - tbh I see them as the major TAs here, even if the conflict is directly with your sister. It seems to me that they're similarly invested in you two looking the same for some reason. I mean... Why the \"cut your hair the same way to make amends!\" bit? Would they find you shaving your head, as opposed to a matching bob, an acceptable alternative? \n\nAnd why do you need to make amends on that scale to begin with? It's one thing to say you owe her an apology- you did lie in the hopes that she'd do it- but to say you owe it to her to match, something there just feels really off. They should be encouraging her to find an identity of her own, and distinctive means of expressing that, rather than enforcing the idea that you two should be identical.",

I don't think that means she sucks. At all. I think it means she's not perfect. Like everybody else to ever walk planet Earth.\n\nQuite frankly I see OP as being the only one here being treated like she doesn't have feelings. She has asked her sister to stop. Not insulted her for doing so. Not mentioned calling her \"annoying\", only feeling annoyed (which she of course has a right to feel). If you are able to constantly mind people's feelings even when they don't mind yours (ignoring you) you are unique. OP not being that saintly does not mean that she sucks.\n\nYou say that OP took a very immature path. I agree. However, being ignored by both parents and sister does, for many, lead to feelings that don't just go away. You think that the mature thing to do would be to continue letting this happen, to continue talking and getting no results... until when? Until she begins to resent her sister for ignoring her? Until she begins to resent her parents for the same reason? Until that resentment rears its ugly head in a way that will be much harder to repair?\n\nPersonally, even if that is the mature option, it's not a wise one, because the only way to avoid a terrible outcome with that plan is to never ever be offended when your family ignore you. I know nobody capable of that. But according to you, if we ever feel that way, we need to \"grow up\".\n\nHow was what she did \"shitty\"? She knew what her sister would do - doesn't mean that this sister didn't have a choice. Like all of the other times, she chose to make it. By herself. Ignoring OP's wishes. There was no \"had to\".\n\nSo, forgive me for the repetition, I can see why OP gave herself a break from respecting her sister's wishes instead of her own.

The parents are the real failures for not making idividuality look appealing to the younger sibling. Considering their reaction, they&#39;ve probably been encouraging this behavior for a while. I would even be willing to bet they took her to get that weird hairstyle (since she&#39;s still a kid) knowing full well where the sister got the idea.</p>\n</div>",
