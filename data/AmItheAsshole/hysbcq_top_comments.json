We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.\n\nA week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.\n\nI immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery.

No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.\n\nI feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. \n\nBosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss.

I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Pal, you did what any well adjusted, reasonable person. You were kind enough to get tested and accept giving a chunk of your liver to someone who was only your partner&#39;s &quot;friend. How did he repay that kindness? He tried to frame your loved one for a serious crime without solid evidence and without trying to talk with her first. The moment he tried to ruin her life and by extension, your life, he forfeited the kindness you showed. If you had given gim the transplant anyways I would consider you a saint. A really dumb one but a saint anyways. But you&#39;re not one;you&#39;re a normal human being and you didn&#39;t owe him anything. Specially not a chunk of your body and specially not after such a dick move.</p>\n\n<p>You are not a murderer by any means. Stop telling yourself that and think you needed to be there for your SO, not in a hospital bed when her life can be ruined by the prick you&#39;re helping. Those people calling you a murderer are full of shit, are talking from emotion or both. Don&#39;t give the attention they don&#39;t deserve. Keep a record of the reports and court veredict in that case and file for a restraining order snd/or a cease and desist. Stop feeling bad for that guy; what really matters in your life is your girlfriend and your integrity. No one who threatens that deserves your pity.</p>\n\n<p>NTA. And by the way, it&#39;s not pettiness even downplaying the events to absurd levels. Everything there  was serious, really serious, and you acted in support for someone you care for and in a reasonable way given the circumstances</p>\n</div>",

The footage was 15, 10 seconds clips of her going to it, taking some bills and walking away. The footage was too grainy to make out bill size, and our lawyer said it didn&#39;t provide context and had been cut to make her look bad, that if the full clip had been played it would have shown her handing the bills to a customer/vendor, and that the footage never showed her putting the money in her pocket or bag, which is usually what is needed to prove it was her stealing. Gf couldn&#39;t even tell from the footage which customer she was dealing with at the time, that&#39;s how mundane the interaction was.</p>\n</div>",

They're difficult, they're heard to recover from, they take permanent lifestyle changes to maintain.  Especially if the man's wife was already stealing from him, I doubt she'd have been the kind of supportive partner he would have needed.  There's an awful good chance your partner could have ended up in jail, you could have ended up with serious health complications trying to recover without a good support system and he might have died anyway since his wife was only interested in getting money and getting out with it.\n\nAlso side note even if it hadn't been the boss or his wife accusing you, if you were scheduled to do an organ donation and you had a major life event happen then it would make sense to reschedule it.  Obviously that's more difficult when you know the recipient but there's a reason that donor health comes first in the process.\n\nEdit: For reference 25% of liver recipients die within 5 years of receiving a transplant and those are the people who were already selected to have the best possibility of outcome.

Liver transplants are not a 100% fix. They&#39;re difficult, they&#39;re heard to recover from, they take permanent lifestyle changes to maintain.  Especially if the man&#39;s wife was already stealing from him, I doubt she&#39;d have been the kind of supportive partner he would have needed.  There&#39;s an awful good chance your partner could have ended up in jail, you could have ended up with serious health complications trying to recover without a good support system and he might have died anyway since his wife was only interested in getting money and getting out with it.</p>\n\n<p>Also side note even if it hadn&#39;t been the boss or his wife accusing you, if you were scheduled to do an organ donation and you had a major life event happen then it would make sense to reschedule it.  Obviously that&#39;s more difficult when you know the recipient but there&#39;s a reason that donor health comes first in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: For reference 25% of liver recipients die within 5 years of receiving a transplant and those are the people who were already selected to have the best possibility of outcome.  <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842\">https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842</a></p>\n</div>",
