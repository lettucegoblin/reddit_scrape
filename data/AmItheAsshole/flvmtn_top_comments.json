She doesn\u2019t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. \n\nSo yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me.

Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.\n\nShe came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*.

If you were trying to provoke him, you wouldn't have told her in the first place.\n\n3.) She has brought other guys over before which you haven't had a problem with (even with the way you dress). You've never complained about them hitting on you because they didn't. You never hit on them (I'm assuming) because you respect your friend. She obviously has some level of trust for you. For her to have such an explosive/negative reaction to you saying something *this one time* is absurd on her part.\n\n4.) You were trying to protect your friend from a guy who obviously has little to no loyalty to her if he's willing to hit on you as soon as she leaves the room. That's a good roommate/friend thing to do. If you were to hide it from her or flirt back, then *you* would be in the wrong. As far as either of you know, you're not the only one he does this with behind her back (he could even be going further with others). Telling her now (being only 4 months in) was better than her finding out later (and possibly in a worse way). \n\nOverall, it sounds like she's in denial about this and doesn't want to accept that her boyfriend would do something like that.

I\u2019ll respect your choice in this guy as a partner and try not to talk to you about this anymore.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That will likely do more for your credibility as well. Then, you just be a good friend to her and let her make a mistake. Be there for her when it blows up. Never say \u201cI Told You So\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Also, you bring the heat to the boyfriend, especially if his behavior makes you uncomfortable. When he hits on you, say flat out \u201chey what you just said makes me uncomfortable and I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t do it again\u201d. Be an asshole if there\u2019s nobody around. \u201cWhat would Lauren think of that question? Gross\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>If he doesn\u2019t respect it, then his behavior will have escalated to predatory harassment and then you have a whole other level of problems on your hands. But just try to be direct with him and see what happens. It may be uncomfortable, but my guess is it\u2019s probably less uncomfortable than fighting with your roommate. Good luck, I\u2019m sorry that situation really does suck!!</p>\n</div>",
