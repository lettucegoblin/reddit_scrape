Terrible. </p>\n\n<p>I wholeheartedly agree with everyone saying he just feels like you&#39;re raising a bar and it&#39;s bringing up insecurities. He feels you&#39;re making him look bad in front of his girlfriend by being...a stand up considerate dude. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s dumb and he&#39;s going to look like an even bigger AH if he ever tries to explain this to anyone...which he&#39;s probably aware of and this is likely making him even more butthurt. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully he figures his issues out. Dude has clearly never had to deal with a shitty roommate. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d swap almost every roommate I&#39;ve ever had COMBINED for you. I&#39;ve lived with some bonafide horror shows...he doesn&#39;t know how good he&#39;s got it!</p>\n</div>",

I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also wonder how it is less useful when there is already a word that means exactly what you\u2019re intending it to mean, therefore one could argue that it becomes less useful when its meaning is modified/construed to mean the opposite of its intended usage. That\u2019s just an opinion, though, and I respect that yours is different. No hurt feelings here lol. \n\nI wasn\u2019t really being pedantic or trying to be scathing/condescending to the commenter to whom I responded. They used the word, said they enjoy learning things, and I thought it was a prime opportunity for them to learn a little something more about a word they had just used. I\u2019m not here trying to police anyone\u2019s use of a word that they enjoy. There will, however, inevitably be at least a small few who hear/see the word and understand it by its original definition, so it\u2019s not a terrible thing to know.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I must disagree with you on the description of factoid\u2019s original definition as \u2018something less useful.\u2019 If something is commonly thought to be true but is not, it narrows the explanation of what has occurred down into a single word, which I think is pretty nifty, myself. I also wonder how it is less useful when there is already a word that means exactly what you\u2019re intending it to mean, therefore one could argue that it becomes less useful when its meaning is modified/construed to mean the opposite of its intended usage. That\u2019s just an opinion, though, and I respect that yours is different. No hurt feelings here lol. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn\u2019t really being pedantic or trying to be scathing/condescending to the commenter to whom I responded. They used the word, said they enjoy learning things, and I thought it was a prime opportunity for them to learn a little something more about a word they had just used. I\u2019m not here trying to police anyone\u2019s use of a word that they enjoy. There will, however, inevitably be at least a small few who hear/see the word and understand it by its original definition, so it\u2019s not a terrible thing to know.</p>\n</div>",

Not only is he the hottest guy on the planet of earth, but he can do literally everything, AND fix cars too?? Almost 19 years later and he is hubby now, still the hottest man on the planet, and I have never paid a mechanic since the day I met him lol. He&#39;s the 8th wonder of the world and I love him so much.</p>\n</div>",
