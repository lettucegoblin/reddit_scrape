THEY could have been calling your parents that morning and reminding them, and THEY could have volunteered to pick your parents up on the way to the service if it was soooooo important to them.</p>\n</div>",

My only requirement was that she be at my car on time (let\u2019s say 6:30pm).  I told her I wouldn\u2019t wait more than 5 minutes for her, and made that VERY clear. She agreed. She said she didn\u2019t like being late, either. First time, she was right on time. Second time she was 15 minutes late. I told her that next time if she was more than 5 minutes late I\u2019d be going without her. She stated she understood, and that I was being \u201cunreasonable\u201d though she acknowledged that she had agreed to my requirement and knew I was doing her a favor. The third time, 5 minutes arrived without her there. I left. She arrived at the meeting 30 minutes late, and was furious with me. I pointed out that she had agreed to the arrangement.

My only requirement was that she be at my car on time (let\u2019s say 6:30pm).  I told her I wouldn\u2019t wait more than 5 minutes for her, and made that VERY clear. She agreed. She said she didn\u2019t like being late, either. First time, she was right on time. Second time she was 15 minutes late. I told her that next time if she was more than 5 minutes late I\u2019d be going without her.
