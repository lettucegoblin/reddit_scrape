I don\u2019t think anything is too sensitive because, c\u2019mon, it\u2019s a Gmail address. Intended recipient is one letter less than my address that I\u2019ve had for years. Every time, I email back they have the wrong address. It\u2019s tapered off, but it took a couple of years. I just didn\u2019t want the dude to get in trouble for missing something. But because my email ended up in other people\u2019s distribution lists, it took FOREVER. \nWell. Not the same situation as OP, I suppose.</p>\n</div>",

He hasn\u2019t messaged us about it or anything. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know, maybe it was because I dislike how lazy this guy was being about changing his shipping info to his new address. That or now I was being put in a position of having tell him to come get his stuff that he knows he bought. And it was annoying at this point. Maybe if one of these things never got to him, because his stuff isn\u2019t my responsibility, maybe he\u2019ll actually update his shipping info.</p>\n\n<p>So I opened it and kept what was inside. It was at least a month after this that he showed up on my doorstep asking if we had seen a package. I said I hasn\u2019t seen anything. He said \u201cthat\u2019s odd, because it was shipped here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I told him well, we\u2019ve had our packages stolen in the past, when we didn\u2019t go get them/let them sit outside all day. </p>\n\n<p>Before going he said, \u201cWell, someone got a nice gift then.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>And then his packages magically never showed up at our house again!</em></p>\n</div>",

It should be to avoid even the slightest possibility of being brought into court or even having to talk to a cop about it. I mean, that would be my goal. Even if there is clearly nothing illegal, a cop could come by to let OP know someone complained and basically say, \u201cyou\u2019re not breaking any law, but cut it out.\u201d And who knows what could go down once a cop is at your door? Well, unfortunately a lot of people do know. And it ain\u2019t good.\n\nThe only benefit OP got from doing this is that he finally got in contact with the guy, but apparently the guy isn\u2019t going to do anything different. Continuing to do it gains him nothing but satisfaction.
