Well they didn&#39;t believe it until you spent 3 weeks lying to them. What else could they believe at that point? </p>\n\n<p>Your girlfriend broke up with you because you tortured her mental state thinking her boyfriend was risking his life over some stupid beliefs. Can you take a second and place yourself in her shoes, the person she loves is killing themselves and won&#39;t listen to reason. On-top of that you ruined probably more than one date making embarrassing requests and claims. All for your entertainment at her expense.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re an asshole, you&#39;re not funny.</p>\n</div>",

She stayed with her boyfriend because she cared for him and was certainly worried about him. Breaking up with someone who changes their diet is stupid.</p>\n\n<p>But breaking up with someone because they placed a joke over their relationship with you? That\u2019s understandable. OP could have said \u2018nah, I ate earlier\u2019 to the server. He could have made the moment more respectful for his GF. But he didn\u2019t. The joke was more important and was worth embarrassing his girlfriend over.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like dating someone who starts wearing diapers because they\u2019ve started to get irregular bowel movements. You might stay with them because it\u2019s not their fault. That\u2019s the <em>adult</em> thing to do. But then you find out that when your SO shat themselves in public it was because they thought it was funny to embarrass you? Hell yeah, I\u2019d dump that asshole.</p>\n\n<p>The joke was hilarious, but you ruined your relationship by placing it over her.</p>\n</div>",

When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \n\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \n\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Strikes me as more of a \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d type of thing, especially since OP himself said that his friends know he\u2019s the kind of person who hard-commits to jokes, which strongly implies he\u2019s done stuff like this before.\n\nAlso a bit weird that OP didn\u2019t include *anyone* in his prank until after he stopped. Like, who is the audience for the \u201cjoke\u201d at that point, besides OP himself? He\u2019s just acting weird as fuck for 3 weeks and the at the end was like, \u201chaha jokes on you I was only pretending!\u201d \n\nI mean, personally, I think what OP did is absolutely hilarious to read about in a reddit post, but putting myself in the shoes of his friends/family while this prank was going on, I can absolutely see why they didn\u2019t find it particularly funny. It was just an inside joke where OP was the only one on the inside. Not super hilarious.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Or, from a different possible perspective,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy did your relationship end?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe had a habit of making \u2018jokes\u2019 that nobody but him found funny, and was too immature to break off the joke even when it was abundantly clear that nobody was laughing but him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hard to assign blame without context, but it would surprise me <em>immensely</em> if this was the sole reason OP\u2019s gf broke up with him. Strikes me as more of a \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d type of thing, especially since OP himself said that his friends know he\u2019s the kind of person who hard-commits to jokes, which strongly implies he\u2019s done stuff like this before.</p>\n\n<p>Also a bit weird that OP didn\u2019t include <em>anyone</em> in his prank until after he stopped. Like, who is the audience for the \u201cjoke\u201d at that point, besides OP himself?
