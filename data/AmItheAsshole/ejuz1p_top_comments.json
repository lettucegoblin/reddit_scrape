Seems to me they obviously knew it would not be well received since they not only didn't run it by you, but also sat back and waited for you to find out by him just showing up. Also, even IF you were in the wrong, causing a scene at the service is neither the time, nor the place, to address the issue. Your aunt should have had enough respect for your mourning and waited until after the fact, to express her feelings about the situation. Though at the end of the day, none of it is about her.\n\nEither way, no matter what the answers to any of the questions are, I am truly sorry for your, and your siblings' loss and hope this whole fiasco hasn't hindered your ability to begin the morning process.",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, dude starts asking for money from people, or bad-mouthing your mom, yeah kick him out ... but booting him for just showing up: YTA.</p>\n</div>",

He only crawled back to her because he had nowhere to stay and no one to take care of him. While she did take him back, it\u2019s a very weird set up. He sleeps in the garage and is only allowed in the house when she is there. I think she took him back to prove a point and treat him like shit.\n\nI am not saying she deserved to die, but I do not feel sorry she did. My point is they both ended up in shitty situations.
