But she was 19 and he was 21 so...yeah.  spoiler alert, I never spoke to her again, even though they broke up a few months later.

Hopefully she will be able to find it in her heart to forgive, but she is only human - imo It would be natural for her not to. Its not like the sister and ex deserve forgiveness, given how they have no remorse about thier actions. Op would have to try painstakingly hard to go the extremely high moral high ground. I probably wouldn't be able to do it myself.\n\nEdit: one more point. You were a bit harsh in your original comment. For example, saying things like 'suck it up' and 'some details most have been ommited, since people in happy marriage don't usually cheat'. I think that was a bit mean. Not everyone who was cheated on was in a terrible marriage. Some of them just married terrible people. Or the cheater themselves were normal people who made a huge mistake. Not everything is black and white, and to imply that the terrible circumstances op was in was partly thier fault is... not the best way to express your opinion.\n\nThank you for keeping this discussion civilised, have a nice day.",
