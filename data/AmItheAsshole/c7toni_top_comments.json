You have no place in someone else's marriage, and even if she's your sister, you have no reason to go this far to out a lie except for doing so out of spite. \n\nAlso, perhaps she wasn't lying. Perhaps your show-up of her (which likely wasn't a very good job, if it took very little time) embarrassed her, and since you wouldn't drop the subject, she admitted it even though it wasn't true. Perhaps it was true, but either way, doing something like that is just straight up trying to humiliate someone else, as well as completely ignoring the possibility that you do things at a faster pace than her. \n\nAnd once again, reddit jumps to extremes immediately. The sister isn't manipulative and abusive because of one lie she told. She isn't a horrible person for wanting a break from doing something she dislikes. \nPerhaps you all should think about why someone might lie about something like that, and why they might change their mind from wanting to do all the chores? Perhaps it was getting too stressful to always be the one doing everything, especially when it comes to something she doesn't like, but she didn't want to admit it because she had wanted to be a stay-at-home wife in the first place. \n\nEveryone on this sub likes to preach about how unhealthy marriages are from these, but they're only small snapshots of them, and if you honestly think every marriage is going to be perfect at all times, you're delusional. You could know exactly how a perfect, completely healthy marriage should be, but the fact is that humans are emotional, often times reckless, and not everything is black and white, especially when different personalities or even mental illnesses come into the mix. Mistakes are going to be made at one point or another.\n\nI swear to God the people on this website think they're all saints or something, and act like they're all emotionless robots who would never do something stupid out of anger/insecurity/embarrassment/fear/etc. Newsflash: That's what humans do. What makes it abusive or unhealthy is if it happens multiple times and the person doesn't recognize they did something wrong.",

Your sister and husband could have agreed to the house keeper both knowing what it was all about, but choosing not to acknowledge just because, and that's their choice honestly.\n\nBut also on the surface your sis does seem manipulative/entitled, but again that's her choice and if her husband is willing to put up with it then it's his problem.

What if your sister secretly has OCD and just can't handle the chemicals and cleaning?  I've been made fun of for not cleaning certain things or not wanting to use chemicals because I have OCD and I freak out.  I doubt this is the case with your sister, but it just popped in my head.

On a lesser magnitude, your sister\u2019s husband is also an asshole for not recognizing you were manipulating him to win sibling rivalry points. And perhaps your sister was an asshole too, for making too big a deal of how she\u2019s getting a cleaner in an attempt to make you jealous.\n\nStill want to thank you though, for reminding me how much I love MY sister. We squabble, but would never act like this. Recently I was having a hard time getting my apt in order, so my sister spent three full days of her visit helping me clean and organize.

Then, he is acting all innocent about his intentions. OP is a major asshole. He lied through the entire post to get people on his side. I live in an apartment, and if I did a quick job, I might could do everything in 2 hours. It would be more like 3 to do a really good job and disinfect and wipe down ALL surfaces. Shitty toilet water sprays even on the walls. You have to wipe all items on the sink area down, b/c again, shitty fecal spray. You have to wipe the cabinets down for the same reason. No way anyone did all of that in two bathrooms and cleaned all of the windows in 30 minutes. He is a big fat lying liar</p>\n</div>",

It\u2019s the same logic as getting your car washed: sure, you can DIY, but they can do it better (likely) and more efficiently (definitely). And yet people at the car wash don\u2019t get this amount of side-eye.</p>\n\n<p>My husband and I are childfree and we both work from home. Right now, we split house chores 50/50-ish, but we\u2019ve already agreed to outsource cleaning once we move to a new place. Nothing\u2019s stopping us from doing it ourselves; we just feel that the service is worth the time we\u2019d be saving. It doesn\u2019t make either of us a lazy shit.</p>\n</div>",
