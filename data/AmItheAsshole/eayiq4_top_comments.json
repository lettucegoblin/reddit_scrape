Through no fault of her own in this instance, your dad showed homophobic traits and played obvious favorites between your boyfriend and your siblings partners. I can see why she would be visibly upset because this is an upsetting and sensitive situation, but your dad has a history of serial dating and showed no respect towards your long term relationship. He was rude and there comes a point where family ties do not make up for lack of decency. Your siblings may not see it the same way because 1) none of them are in a gay relationship (I'm assuming, also assuming you identify as male), and 2) because depending on how much they grew up around your dad they may not see his actions as being as offensive as they actually were. 10/10 support what you said to him and definitely don't think you should go to the wedding. When your dad learns how to respect you and your relationships for what they really are, then maybe he can start to have a real relationship with his child, but until then he can wallow in his shallow lifestyle. If your step mom (the fiancee) continues to be a good person towards you guys, then obviously you would reciprocate, but unfortunately she's along for your dad's ride. Hopefully she improves him somehow.",

She doesn't deserve to be verbally beat up because someone doesn't approve of her life choices.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You have no idea if the fiancee was going to speak to father later. Many people do not confront people in front of others, certainly with close family members. I find it hot-headed and usually a bad idea to jump into a family fight when it is happening. She is new, she is feeling things out. This could have been the first time she heard anything like that from him and was processing it. It would be cool if we all said the perfect thing at the perfect time, but some of us have to wait to make our move.</p>\n\n<p>And to others saying she deserves it because she will be the 5th wife...yeah, no. She doesn&#39;t deserve to be verbally beat up because someone doesn&#39;t approve of her life choices.</p>\n</div>",

It's her wedding, too, and she put herself in the crossfire by not sticking up for respecting others. She could have said she wanted to talk about it later, or just dissented, but I'm guessing she was too afraid of the asshole to ever do that. She felt she should keep her mouth shut and follow her partner's decision, which may be a reason why she is the fiancee. I feel for this person, but that relationship is a choice, and it kind of makes her an asshole, too. I'm inferring a lot, but why, if the fiancee was so woke, would she not stand up for her beliefs?",

Two of them always made a point to talk about plans or going to concerts when I was around, but never inviting me or just flat out saying I could not come. \n\nIt never really bothered my tbh because those two were SO HARD to work with, down from their work ethic to just personality reasons. So it wasn't like my feelings were getting hurt, but one day my friend \"S\" from work pointed out how rude they had been since I started and we kinda joked and laughed it off and went about the day. \n\nWell it was getting close to closing that night and we were all sitting around and talking. Me, S, and the two problem girls all together. They sat whispering on the side so S and I started making plans for the weekend on what to do. \n\nWe decided we would go camping out at my family's land, invite some friends, watch movies, and just relax around good people and good times. We had chosen the day to go and what time. I told her I would pick her up and we would wrangle together some more people and stay out there for a day or two. \n\nThe other two girls overheard and wanted to come too. They didn't even ask if they could, just asked when I would meet to pick them up too. S and I looked at each other and I said exactly what they had said to me the last time the whole workplace went out...\"sorry, this was just a friend's get together and I don't really know you. Maybe next time. \" I'm sure you can imagine their faces.\n\nI got tired of all the drama and quit after just nearly 6 months of working there. That many young women together was not working well for anyone. They would talk about their best friend behind their back the moment they left the room. Very toxic people. \n\nI still keep in touch with S by the way and we still joke about what happened that day and the way the other 2 reacted. It was funny but caused a lot of issues at work after that. Which led to the reason of me quitting.\n\nEdit: some spelling",
