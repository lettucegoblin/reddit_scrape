He sounds really entitled and not willing to compromise on anything which will lead to much worse problems with him down the line.\n\nMostly the biggest red flag is his not listening to you though. You're absolutely right about the age difference and loving situation thing. It's also really gross to call you a \"young hot\" thing and then get upset when you call him on behavior related to your age difference. You're the one at a disadvantage in your age related power dynamic, your views should really be given equal if not more weight than his.\n\nI was in similar age gap relationships when I was in my early and mid 20's and have found that dudes who want that kind of relationship are very plentiful. Dropping the disrespectful ones and finding cooler ones to hang out with/have sex with/enjoy some of the financial stability and better living situations they have is MUCH better than hanging onto the bad ones. (I don't even mean that in a sugar baby way, just having sex with someone in a nice quiet and private place is a perk of putting up with someone who ultimately almost certainly won't take you as seriously as someone their own age, statistically speaking)\n\nAlso, an hour round trip is not a long time to go to spend with someone? I've had partners who were willing to travel much longer than that for \"hot young\" tail, and vice versa when I thought the older person was worth it. Like 1-3.5 hours one way, traveling as a disabled person, if I liked the person enough for that. This dude balking at a 30 minute drive is telling you via that attitude that he doesn't value time with you overly much tbh. Age gap relationships can be really weird when you're that young, the older person really needs to put more effort into making themself worth your time if they want to keep you around.",

You&#39;re the one at a disadvantage in your age related power dynamic, your views should really be given equal if not more weight than his.</p>\n\n<p>I was in similar age gap relationships when I was in my early and mid 20&#39;s and have found that dudes who want that kind of relationship are very plentiful. Dropping the disrespectful ones and finding cooler ones to hang out with/have sex with/enjoy some of the financial stability and better living situations they have is MUCH better than hanging onto the bad ones. (I don&#39;t even mean that in a sugar baby way, just having sex with someone in a nice quiet and private place is a perk of putting up with someone who ultimately almost certainly won&#39;t take you as seriously as someone their own age, statistically speaking)</p>\n\n<p>Also, an hour round trip is not a long time to go to spend with someone? I&#39;ve had partners who were willing to travel much longer than that for &quot;hot young&quot; tail, and vice versa when I thought the older person was worth it. Like 1-3.5 hours one way, traveling as a disabled person, if I liked the person enough for that. This dude balking at a 30 minute drive is telling you via that attitude that he doesn&#39;t value time with you overly much tbh. Age gap relationships can be really weird when you&#39;re that young, the older person really needs to put more effort into making themself worth your time if they want to keep you around.</p>\n</div>",

And the floors creak when people move. \n\nI've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.\n\nAnd the sound of the girls in the apartment to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. \n\nI know when I play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. So I'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. \n\nSo... When my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. Which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and I said no. \n\nFor example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. He wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her TV. I said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. \n\nAt 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. I said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. \n\nAt 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. I offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.\n\nHe had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. \n\nI got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him \"you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! I don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... Hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!\" \n\n(The 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)\n\nHe got irritated and asked why I was bringing age into it, and I said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! And he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.\n\nHe got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when I'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with \"ok boomer\" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a \"rich person apartment\" he could pay for it. \n\nAITA for what I said to my boyfriend about my apartment?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The soundproofing is so good I\u2019ve literally never heard a neighbor from my apartment except from the front door when someone is in the shared breezeway. \n\nWhen we lived in the Midwest before we owned a house because it was reasonable for our situation there.

I\u2019m in a bigger city and we\u2019re only here short term (two years) so we have an apartment, but it\u2019s a very nice apartment that\u2019s pet friendly and has tons of dogs. The soundproofing is so good I\u2019ve literally never heard a neighbor from my apartment except from the front door when someone is in the shared breezeway. </p>\n\n<p>When we lived in the Midwest before we owned a house because it was reasonable for our situation there. In a city it just makes more sense to rent a lot of the time regardless of whether you could technically afford a house.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>TBH this. I own two condos. The housing market in my brother&#39;s area is really hot and he would have to take out a massive loan to be able to afford a condo in that area, so I offered to sell my condo (which my family was using as an occasional weekend getaway) to help him finance his, and we&#39;ll have his condo in both of our names (same last name). I know my situation is pretty unusual but it could just be the family finances.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, he is a massive asshole and normal 35 year olds don&#39;t date 22 year olds. I&#39;m around that age and I&#39;d find anyone around me dating a 22 year old super creepy.</p>\n</div>",
