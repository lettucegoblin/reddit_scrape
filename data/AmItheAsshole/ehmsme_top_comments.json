It would throw most people. </p>\n\n<p>So I think finding a way to tell him appropriately is a good thing if there is a reasonable chance he will find out in other ways.</p>\n</div>",

Dad is the title you earned from time and respect. I have 2 biological kids with my wife. But I'm also dad to about a dozen other kids and always will be. This was a role I was willing to accept. The mentor, the role model, dad. I am the father figure for so many of my kids friends who come around often. To some of my coworkers, their kids call me uncle because of the relationships I've built with my employees. Some of the younger ones jokingly call me dad. \n\nIt's not an insult to be called dad, it's not weird to be called dad. But one thing you will have to realize that telling this child the truth will shatter his whole world. This discussion will damage him far beyond any form of repair, especially if you try to get him to stop calling you dad and your wife mom. \n\nSometimes a sacrifice must be made, and a lie maintained for the better of another. \n\nIf you do go through with this, one thing must be clear. You may be his older brother and your wife his sister in law, but you must keep being mom and dad. His relationship with you and the other kids in this home depend on it.",

Hope you're getting child support from the asshole bio parents.\n\nThis actually is not very common. Both of our teens were adopted as infants and when we were in the early stages, everything we read said to discuss it as early as possible. The general advice from everyone familiar with adoption is that you should absolutely never wait until a child is \"old enough.\" By that point it is too late. You want it to always be something they have known and don't want it to be some big reveal. We started talking about it when our kids were still infants. Not because they could understand but because it got us comfortable talking about it. In both of our cases it wasn't something we could have hid anyway (transracial adoptions are fairly obvious) but there is no reason to keep it a secret. By preschool they were answering questions from curious peers about the racial difference (my son's go to line was \"He's white because I'm adopted but he's still my daddy\") and as teens my kids say that adoption is like their eye color. It's just a fact of life and not something they think about unless it's mentioned. \n\nI do agree that OP isn't the asshole. He was a young kid when he became his brother's guardian and fully stepped up when no one else would. He did what he thought was best and I won't fault him for that, but I wanted to address that misconception in case any people here hoping to adopt see this and think this is still the best recommended practice. The teen years are generally considered the worst time for a kid to find out about their adoption status and OP should have a therapist with a background in adoption and trauma help navigate a potentially devastating reveal.",

        "body": "My son is 8. His biological father sexually assaulted me. His dad has been in his life since before he was born and we have been married since our son was 7 months old. We have always been a family of 3. That being said, we've told my son since he was very little that families are formed in different ways and that he is not biologically related to his dad- well before he could really understand what that meant. He knows- as in- if the topic were to come up, he might say something like \"oh that's funny that you think I look like my dad because we're not biologically related\"- but he still hasn't connected the dots that there must have been another human involved with his creation at some point. I dread the day. I refuse to make it a mystery- because I will not allow him to glamorize this unknown person - imagining there's a great person out there for him to someday meet- but I am going to have to explain it to him at some point, some day. \n\nI guess I'm waiting for him to connect the dots and to ask.. we're going through ivf trying to have another child, and so our son (almost 9) understands the basics- that there's an egg and sperm, that it takes both a male and female - etc etc. I'm assuming at some point it's going to come up in question. I know I can't avoid telling him that the other DNA he has comes from a monster, but I don't want to make him feel bad - unfortunately - my pregnancy with him already left me disabled. \n\nHe's joked that he \"broke me\" and he's aware that if I'd never had him, I would probably still be a healthy police officer- but I worry that when he knows the truth, that he may feel some guilt. :-/ \n\nI'm glad that you shared this though. I didn't want to wait until he was 12/13 and feel like I was suddenly dropping it on him.

His dad has been in his life since before he was born and we have been married since our son was 7 months old. We have always been a family of 3. That being said, we&#39;ve told my son since he was very little that families are formed in different ways and that he is not biologically related to his dad- well before he could really understand what that meant. He knows- as in- if the topic were to come up, he might say something like &quot;oh that&#39;s funny that you think I look like my dad because we&#39;re not biologically related&quot;- but he still hasn&#39;t connected the dots that there must have been another human involved with his creation at some point. I dread the day. I refuse to make it a mystery- because I will not allow him to glamorize this unknown person - imagining there&#39;s a great person out there for him to someday meet- but I am going to have to explain it to him at some point, some day. </p>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;m waiting for him to connect the dots and to ask.. we&#39;re going through ivf trying to have another child, and so our son (almost 9) understands the basics- that there&#39;s an egg and sperm, that it takes both a male and female - etc etc. I&#39;m assuming at some point it&#39;s going to come up in question. I know I can&#39;t avoid telling him that the other DNA he has comes from a monster, but I don&#39;t want to make him feel bad - unfortunately - my pregnancy with him already left me disabled. </p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s joked that he &quot;broke me&quot; and he&#39;s aware that if I&#39;d never had him, I would probably still be a healthy police officer- but I worry that when he knows the truth, that he may feel some guilt. :-/ </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m glad that you shared this though. I didn&#39;t want to wait until he was 12/13 and feel like I was suddenly dropping it on him. Even if he doesn&#39;t fully &quot;get it&quot; right now, he can never claim we didn&#39;t tell him or that we kept it a secret.</p>\n</div>",

To me, that\u2019s plain common sense. Your analogy to President Trump doesn\u2019t quite fit here - no, I\u2019ve never run a country, but as my quality of American life and I are directly affected by our president\u2019s/government\u2019s choices, that *does* give me the right to opine in those matters.\n\nSecondly, the manner of how OP\u2019s brother/son was adopted is not what\u2019s up for discussion here and is a diversion from the true topic at play (though not intended, I believe). The thread here has detracted from specificity to OP\u2019s case to when adoptees in general should be informed of their adoption status - *that* is my concern here.\n\nLastly, in response to your final, more meta concern: I am actually trying to find a way to message the r/AITA mod team as a whole and request they remove future posts centering on anomalous adoption in deference to subs better fitted to handle them.

Your analogy to President Trump doesn\u2019t quite fit here - no, I\u2019ve never run a country, but as my quality of American life and I are directly affected by our president\u2019s/government\u2019s choices, that <em>does</em> give me the right to opine in those matters.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the manner of how OP\u2019s brother/son was adopted is not what\u2019s up for discussion here and is a diversion from the true topic at play (though not intended, I believe). The thread here has detracted from specificity to OP\u2019s case to when adoptees in general should be informed of their adoption status - <em>that</em> is my concern here.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, in response to your final, more meta concern: I am actually trying to find a way to message the <a href=\"/r/AITA\">r/AITA</a> mod team as a whole and request they remove future posts centering on anomalous adoption in deference to subs better fitted to handle them. Because you\u2019re right: my attitude here <em>is</em> hypocritical for this sub. However, this post shouldn\u2019t have been on this sub in the first place.</p>\n</div>",
