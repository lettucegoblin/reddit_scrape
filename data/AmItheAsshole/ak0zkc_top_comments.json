Your date didn\u2019t think it was rude of you to want to, in general, give some nice feedback. \n\nWhat was rude was:\nA. You asked to see the manager, and the waitress clearly communicated that she was worried this would be a complaint, and instead of reassuring her and saying \u201coh no! Everything was great, I want to tell your manager!\u201d You just repeated that you wanted to speak to the manager..... that poor waitress probably had a whole panic attack on the way over to get him. \n\nB. You made it some big song and dance to give positive feedback. Positive feedback is nice, and if your server was particularly exceptional, and you happen to run into the manager on your way to the restroom, or he walks by your table, pointing out how great your server is might be a nice thing to do. But making it into some big production (and please refer to part A for how that all went...) was really sort of arrogant. \n\nAlso (and this piggy backs on part A)- you used your position as a customer to exercise power over the waitress. Which is a huge red flag for your date. You knew your waitress would need to go get the manager if you asked. You know that when someone asks to speak to a manager there\u2019s usually a problem. You knew that this waitress was worried that you were going to make a complaint about her. Instead of considering how she felt you decided to continue to exercise your power as the customer by ignoring her question, and giving her the exact same command a second time. \n\nYour date saw in you a very manipulative little blip. A momentary red flag that told her you understand positions of power, and whether your intentions are good or bad, you intend to exercise your power with little regard to those at your mercy. \n\nYour date also saw a man who uses a certain type of gesture to impress a woman. \u201cLet me exercise my power and then ultimately compliment the little guy.\u201d It was all one big flex for you, and mildly patronizing for the waitress, you made her feel helpless and then gave her a pat on the head. Not caring how that waitress felt having to go get her manager, and making it this big show, demonstrated a severe lack of class. Zero regard for others, doing good deeds intentionally with an audience. It\u2019s just all bad.... it\u2019s all red flags. \n\nEDIT- it seems like others are really covering the basis here with everything I said in my comment. So I guess I\u2019ll offer a little advice to you. \n\nIf you like this girl, like you *actually* like this girl, and *genuinely* want to be with her and you want to fix this you need to do 2 things:\n\n1. Admit to yourself that you fucked up during this date. Reflect on that. Try and understand how that waitress felt. Evaluate your thought process when you were going through it and realize that either you were trying to be a big shot, or you had absolutely 0 foresight and ended up looking like an ass. And then fix whichever one of those you conclude to be the problem, and promise yourself you\u2019re going to be a little more conscientious from now on. \n\n2. Call your date, and tell her you fucked up. Admit that you wanted to impress her. Tell her you really like her, you wanted to impress her, and you don\u2019t know why you thought that situation was acceptable. Admit to fucking up. Admit that you wanted to compliment the waitress for her service and went about it horribly and ended up using her as a pawn in your quest to do a good deed. And tell her that you understand how big of a tool she must think you are now. Ask her for one more chance, a date, your treat, on her terms (whatever she wants to do- within reason, obviously, this isn\u2019t fair game to be made into a door mat). And hope that she sees some sort of redeeming quality in that. \n\nIn all honesty- if this is the only situation that you two have ended up in where she left thinking you were a big douche, you should be able to bounce back from it with some honest self reflection and a genuine apology/explanation.

It\u2019s just all bad.... it\u2019s all red flags. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT- it seems like others are really covering the basis here with everything I said in my comment. So I guess I\u2019ll offer a little advice to you. </p>\n\n<p>If you like this girl, like you <em>actually</em> like this girl, and <em>genuinely</em> want to be with her and you want to fix this you need to do 2 things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Admit to yourself that you fucked up during this date. Reflect on that. Try and understand how that waitress felt. Evaluate your thought process when you were going through it and realize that either you were trying to be a big shot, or you had absolutely 0 foresight and ended up looking like an ass. And then fix whichever one of those you conclude to be the problem, and promise yourself you\u2019re going to be a little more conscientious from now on. </p></li>\n<li><p>Call your date, and tell her you fucked up. Admit that you wanted to impress her. Tell her you really like her, you wanted to impress her, and you don\u2019t know why you thought that situation was acceptable. Admit to fucking up. Admit that you wanted to compliment the waitress for her service and went about it horribly and ended up using her as a pawn in your quest to do a good deed. And tell her that you understand how big of a tool she must think you are now. Ask her for one more chance, a date, your treat, on her terms (whatever she wants to do- within reason, obviously, this isn\u2019t fair game to be made into a door mat). And hope that she sees some sort of redeeming quality in that. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In all honesty- if this is the only situation that you two have ended up in where she left thinking you were a big douche, you should be able to bounce back from it with some honest self reflection and a genuine apology/explanation. </p>\n</div>",

You have an extreme lack of empathy and compassion based on your post and on your views on tipping. Please do some self reflection and practice putting yourself in another person's shoes. \n\n1. That server probably had a heart attack when you asked to see a manager with no explanation after working so hard to ensure you and your date had a wonderful evening. How hard would it have been to say, \"I just want to ensure your boss knows you're doing a wonderful job.\"\n\n2. Your views on tipping disturb me. I understand the feeling that you don't feel it should be your perogative to \"pay their wages\" but that is the system in this country. Until that system changes that is how you should follow it if you go out to eat. I myself am a server and I love me job because I love people and showing them a good time with excellent service and delicious food. However, serving can be very demanding and working your ass off for a shit tip frankly, fucking sucks. If you enjoy your service you need to pay for it. You're paying for my excellent service. It's the same as paying for anyone else's service. Please think about how you would feel if you weren't paid for your  hard work  and service. It would suck a duck right?  So reevaluate (SP?) yourself on this front.\n\n3. Your date. I am very proud of that woman for having the ability to call you out on your bullshit. If someone was blatantly showboating in front of you on a date you'd be pretty turned off right? I also want to ensure that when you say \"good listener\" you mean she listens to what you have to say, understands you, and replies with an answer showing she listened. By your explanation it sounds like you like that she's quiet and that can show a misogynistic view of women. I'm just going to ask you to also self reflect on your views of women and what you want in a partner. \n\nSo, you're the asshole. But you can be not the asshole in the future with a little self reflection, empathy, and compassion. Caring for others and wanting to help them isn't weak. It's very attractive and shows a strong sense of smarts and love. Do some learnin' friend. ",

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nNot a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager.

It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Not a clickbait title, that&#39;s actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.</p>\n\n<p>I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn&#39;t obsessed with herself. She&#39;s funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we&#39;ll get there.)</p>\n\n<p>Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn&#39;t really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten <em>excellent</em> service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best.

Good intentions (I guess) but there were a number of better ways to execute. 9 times out of 10 when a customer asks to speak to a manager it\u2019s bad news and this server probably knows this. So to ask her to speak to the manager not only once but when she asks if something is wrong and you just repeat your request it is easy to assume it\u2019s a complaint. Sure it ended up as a compliment and at the end of the meal the server went away happy, but for those 2 minutes she went to go get her manager she was more than likely scared she screwed up. It is easy to see why the girl you are on a date with would get annoyed. In her eyes you not only scared this poor server for no reason, but then you tried to look cool by making a big scene (having her, server and manager) all around for your praise. \n\nMy recommendation to you is next time just leave a big tip with a note that says \u201cyou were awesome\u201d or on your way out grab a manager and tell them about your service privately. Even a good yelp review will ultimately get to the manager and server and make them both happy. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think you as a person are an asshole (based off this story).
