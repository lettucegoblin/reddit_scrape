If they aren't going to listen in person, then you need to go higher up the chain, go as high as you need to to make sure your children are protected.\n\nMy niece is part M\u0101ori, and we've had to drum it in to her, at 4 years old, that if any adult tells her she doesn't need sunscreen she's to stand her ground and insist on it. If the adult still refuses, she needs to go find another adult.\n\nEven her M\u0101ori father was under the impression they didn't need sunscreen, because they're already brown. We were all shocked and immediately jumped to \"what about protecting yourself from *skin cancer*\".\n\nWe've had one incident with a reliever teacher not listening to my niece, and she went to another teacher who put sunscreen on her. The reliever got spoken to about it. I don't think she was necessarily coming from a racist POV, but had believed the myth, and genuinely didn't think that POC needed it. \n\nWhile I think that some people may be racist in their thinking on this subject, I think some people just genuinely believe this myth as they've had no cause to really think about how sunscreen doesn't just protect from being sunburnt - which is what the myth seems to be about, POC don't burn due to darker pigments in the skin?? - rather than thinking through the other consequences of not wearing sunscreen, like skin cancer. Maybe it *is* racial bias, honestly, I don't know because I'm white, but until my Brother-in-law said he didn't need sunscreen one day years ago, it was never something I'd ever actually thought about myself. I live in a country with a hole in our ozone layer, so we've been bought up our whole lives to \"Slip (on a t-shirt), Slop (on the some sunscreen), Slap (on a hat), and Rap (on some sunnies)\". I never considered whether M\u0101ori, Tongans, Cook Islanders or Samoans did the same, I hope they do, but after learning of the myths existence, I suspect a lot of them have bought in to the myth themselves due to my country having a *very* high rate of skin cancers, and a prevalence that these communities don't seek out medical attention.\n\nStand your ground Mama, keep fighting for your child and let's all work together to get this myth busted!",

Melanin can protect against some kinds of sun damage, but not all of them. And they're segregating kids based on the color of their skin? Making them sit in the sun if they're black?? Gross. If it's hot enough, anyone can get heat exhaustion or heat stroke, especially young kids, who are way more susceptible to the effects. \n\nMakes me wonder if they're protecting the white kids from sun exposure because if the white kids came home with visible sun burns, more parents would have visible evidence that the day care is not treating kids well. A black parent may not be able to get photographic evidence of a sunburn on their kid, depending on the amount of melanin in their kid's skin, because the redness may not be visible on skin with more melanin. But peeling, sensitivity and, later, hyperpigmentation would be evidence of a sunburn and sun damage. It makes me wonder if there are other ways that the daycare staff are neglecting children, ways that haven't been explicitly seen yet. It's so wrong that adults are hurting and neglecting children because of their own personal belief that black people don't need sunscreen. \n\nYour review just tells everyone how messed up these people are. I hope the racist staff gets replaced. If the problem goes all the way to the owner of the daycare, I hope they get shut down.

First, you should get all the other parents of Black kids together at one time and go into the office of the director and explain that if they don\u2019t start giving your kids sunscreen and stop separating them from white kids for any reason, you are all pulling your kids out that very day. You should also call your state\u2019s regulatory group and inform them of what\u2019s going on. Then you all should get an attorney and sue them for discrimination.

There were several instances of neglect and unequal treatment - it happens more than we as a society would like to admit - but I want to share one memory that this triggered. \n\nI went to a summer program once. I am white. However, I was one of the only kids who could not afford the \u201cextras\u201d (like tennis lessons or day trips or arts and crafts time). There was a noticeable difference in how I was treated. Notably, I was left at the pool one day, alone, in the direct sun, for 8 hours. The staff did not give me sunscreen, even though my mom had sent me with my own. The other children, whose parents were paying more for the program, were consistently supervised while at the pool. They got priority for other activities, so they were sent inside when they were tired of swimming. I was told that the other activities were \u201cfull\u201d so I should stay outside. I went home that night with a full body sun burn that made my mom question whether she should bring her 7yo to the emergency room. I still have skin damage from that burn over 20 years later. Even more, I still have psychological damage from that treatment. The sunburn was the most visible sign, but the people who treated me differently from my peers also allowed (and probably unconsciously encouraged) the other children to treat me differently. I was bullied at that program, often in a very physical way. I don\u2019t know that I ever admitted that to my mother until I was an adult, so don\u2019t necessarily expect your child to come forward with it either. \n\nThis kind of treatment from staff is very pointedly treating your child and children like her as \u201cother.\u201d It is symbolically important and is being witnessed by not only your daughter but the other children in their care. Even if they don\u2019t have the experience to contextual or what\u2019s happening, it can influence them. I would very much support you in any decision to publicize this behavior.

That\u2019s messed up that they did not give it after you gave an approved doctors note and filled out the form and sent her with sunscreen.  </p>\n\n<p>But there are a couple legitimate policies just to be clear to everyone because some people are flipping out at the wrong things, which takes away from the blatant racism they\u2019ve said. </p>\n\n<p>1) in my state, sunscreens were and probably still are considered a medication that needs to be approved and a form written out by parents with the specific name of the sunscreen (i.e. Equate SPF 50 or Tropical Banana SPF 30, to be applied as needed for exposure of skin to sun) </p>\n\n<p>2) you can never share sunscreen among kids because the state views it the same as sharing a medication among kids </p>\n\n<p>3) The only reason they should not have given it is if you weren\u2019t sending it along with an approved form/doctors note. There should be zero argument about this and their reasoning is racist.</p>\n</div>",
