She was the asshole the moment she argued something was more culturally right for a culture she is not a part of. She doesn&#39;t get to make that call.</p>\n</div>",

One of the words was \"Chanukah\". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to \"Hanukkah\". She said to my daughter \"you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?\" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.\n\nI told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.\n\nThe teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.\n\nMy husband says I overreacted.

Instead the teacher had to argue with the Jewish child and parent about something she clearly didn&#39;t know much about or have any lived experience with?? \nOn a deeper level, the teacher was basically saying &quot;I&#39;ll be inclusive of your culture, but only if it looks the way I want it to look&quot;. It&#39;s extremely infuriating. Like no, you&#39;re not Jewish and you don&#39;t get to &#39;correct&#39; me about MY culture, and then get the brownie points because you were trying to be &#39;inclusive&#39;?? Goys sometimes..</p>\n</div>",

I was SO humilliated, arrived home nearly in tears. My mom went to talk to the teacher and explain that there are red mountains in some parts of our country, and the teacher told her to let it go, that she was jus teaching me to be pushy when wrong.

And if nothing else, you stood up for your kid and that is IMO worth the whole thing alone, as I\u2019m sure it is to her.</p>\n</div>",

YOU NEED TO PAY BETTER ATTENTION\u201d.\n\nI was upset  because she ruined my journal and I wanted to show my family and because I damn well knew how to spell llama. \n\nI protested, quietly, at her desk during snack time that it was, in fact, spelled llama. \n\nShe argued with me loudly, so everyone was staring (and I wasn\u2019t a popular kid) and I turned bright red and tried not to cry and just slunk back to my chair. \n\nMy mom got mad and asked for a meeting. She stood there with a dictionary and looked it up and showed it to the teacher. \n\nShe was all smiles and said did you know that she still has 3 entries left in her journal that she hasn\u2019t finished?\n\nMy mom was like, we can discuss that in a minute, but you ruined her story and she was right. \n\nShe got this mean look on her face and said some kids are careless and need extra notes to remind them to think before they just write anything. \n\nMy mom, practically snarling at this point said, \u201cmy daughter spelled LLAMA correctly. This is exactly how you spell it. You took your red marker and marked through EVERY SINGLE PLACE SHE WROTE THE WORD, telling her that she was wrong and ruining her story that she put a lot of time into. But YOU were wrong. SHE was RIGHT. We can barely even read the story now because you slashed all over it in red and I think you owe her an apology.\u201d\n\nAt that point mrs B was seething. Essentially she said that she was a teacher and just being a mom doesn\u2019t mean you know everything about your kid and she doesn\u2019t see how I act or most of my work (I was a quiet kid who was well liked by all of my other teachers) and so don\u2019t you come demanding an apology for nothing and that I should apologize to her for being so disrespectful about all of this. \n\nMy mom put her arm around me and said, \u201cthis is what it looks like when a person has so little to be happy about in her own life, that she has to try to feel smarter than kids.

It is a Polyenes language (I am not sure which). She wanted me to sing and put it online. I explained that while I want to learn the words and have fun with it, it can be insensitive to post such a thing because it doesn't seem like learning it seems like poking fun of the language. She told me she didn't think that was offensive. I explained she and I didn't get to make that call! It isn't my culture so I am going to approach it with openness and sensitivity. Sure, blurting out jibberish for the opening of the Lion King was fun, but I imagine anyone who speaks Swahili was rolling their eyes!",

We almost bought another house and moved at one point and backed out of the last minute, etc. So for three straight years, I kept thinking I was going to move and telling my friends I was moving. When the house finally did sell I was in third grade and had already been enrolled for the next school year.

It kept getting listed and unlisted because my mom didn&#39;t want to sell.  We almost bought another house and moved at one point and backed out of the last minute, etc. So for three straight years, I kept thinking I was going to move and telling my friends I was moving. When the house finally did sell I was in third grade and had already been enrolled for the next school year.

Which is the day after All Hallows\u2019 day (saints day). Souls day, hallows day. And hallows eve is a three day celebration thats been happening across several cultures, for thousand years. And those days have been influenced from similar days like pagans Samhain, where the souls of dead kin where to visit and living family members would set out tables of food and personal items for them. \n\nEven Mexican scholars debate the validity of Dia Muertos as being completely separated from All Saints day or Todos los Santos, that\u2019s usually celebrated in Spain or Latin America. Most of the modern characteristics of Dia Muertos didnt begin until the Mexican revolution in the early 1900s, which completely transformed Mexican culture and government. Yet the same traditions that happen in Mexico for Dia Muertos, before and after the revolution, were the same traditions people across Europe and Latin American did for saint day, or souls day or even Samhain.  Christians and Muslims in the Middle East have been celebrating Thursday of the Dead, though they celebrate in spring and it ties in to older mourning practices. Even in the Philippines they celebrate Todos Los Santos, where their celebrations and rituals are held in cemeteries to honor their dead kin and leave candles by their doors at home in case those dead kin follow them back from the cemetery. \n\nThese same traditions and celebrations have been observed from literally all over the world, from Africa to the Middle East to Asia to Latin America. While they may have different meanings and days to different cultures, they all influence each other and even stem from each other, like Dia Muertos. \n\nThese days and celebrations/observations may have different names (and maybe even dates) to different cultures or parts of the world, but they\u2019re all pretty much the same. The all celebrate the dead in some way and recognize the season/time of year/harvest. So what one person may consider a Halloween thing, another person sees it as a Dia Muertos thing and another person could see it as a Souls/Saints day things. \n\nFurther more, calling something creepy is not necessarily a bad or negative thing. Creepy can have so many different meanings in many different contexts. Also depending on the person using it and the person hearing it. Creepy is associated with uneasiness, uncomfortable, uncanny, dismal, or even disgust/repulsive. Which is where the miscommunication comes from, her saying that skeletons are creepy could mean she finds them uncomfortable or even scary. But it seems as you took that as calling the skeletons (and therefore Dia Muertos) as gross/disgusting. Which is why you called it insensitive and she most likely didn\u2019t agree with you.  Neither of you are wrong, but in the same sense, neither of you are right. \n\nBottom line; Coco can be an amazing movie for children to watch and learn how different cultures/countries have their own meaning and celebrations for   certain holidays and times of the year. In my house we watch it every Halloween (or around that time of the year) and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",
