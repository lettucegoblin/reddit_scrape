Also the things you listed sound like minor annoyances because she\u2019s a bit absent minded, but clearly they were a bigger deal to you then you let on or discussed with her.

If you can\u2019t sit down, pause, and communicate with your partner what\u2019s going on and how you feel and your immediate reaction to someone you\u2019re getting ready to marry is gtfo of my house and life then the marriage was doomed from the start.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>ESH. It\u2019s clear you were looking for a way out and boom the dog gave you the out you needed. She was at her bachelorette party, she was careless about the dog and that was a big mistake. But it was a mistake. If you had said she purposely gave the dog edibles and liquor to drink I\u2019d say you\u2019re totally justified. But that wasn\u2019t the case and dogs are like kids they get into things they shouldn\u2019t very quickly. It sounds like you left the dog at the house because you assumed she\u2019d want the dog there but if you both knew she\u2019d be getting effed up (which HELLO bachelorette party) then why would either of you have the dog over there for her to look after? Locking it in the room all night seems ridiculous when you could have taken the pup with you. Also the things you listed sound like minor annoyances because she\u2019s a bit absent minded, but clearly they were a bigger deal to you then you let on or discussed with her. Now your grasping at other things to justify your rash decision. If you can\u2019t sit down, pause, and communicate with your partner what\u2019s going on and how you feel and your immediate reaction to someone you\u2019re getting ready to marry is gtfo of my house and life then the marriage was doomed from the start. You\u2019ll both be better off.</p>\n</div>",

That's not only understandable, it's great - don't fucking marry people you know won't make good partners, spouses, or parents (since OP mentioned children in another comment).

Marriage is a commitment to act as a team - you left your teammate out of the loop, gave her no opportunity to fix her negative/worrying behaviours, then went for the nuclear option when she continued to behave in the way you'd already observed.\n\nIt's almost as though you waited for her to do something that would give you an excuse to leave without feeling like you were at fault. You describe her crying so much she can't speak so dispassionately - everyone around you seems to have more empathy for her than you, and you're supposed to be her life partner.\nShe was irresponsible. She was genuinely sorry. It wasn't her intention to harm the dog, she loves the dog and the dog is going to be ok! This definitely seems to be more about you wanting out of the relationship than anything she actually did or didn't do.\n\nEdit: OP's edits show they both need to communicate better, but doesn't change my overall judgement.\n----------------------------\n\nOP says he did raise her carelessness before this, but it still reads to me, based on the example he gives, that this wasn't open communication along the lines of \"I'm seriously concerned about X behaviour for y and z reasons and if you're not able to work on that it makes me question whether I can stay in this relationship\", because who comes out of that conversation calling their partner \"cute\"?! The fact he proposed despite this also supports that he wasn't communicating clearly.\n\nSimilarly, OP's ex-fiancee doesn't seem to be communicating clearly either. Crying so much she can't speak, plus observers of the relationship  concluding that OP is overreacting, seems to indicate she is sorry, but the fact that she hasn't directly apologised or contacted him says volumes about their relationship from both sides.\n\nNo one comes out of the revised scenario looking rosy, but OP is still the a-hole for blaming the break-up on her and this situation instead of a. having an real conversation about the issues before now and b. admitting this isn't about the dog.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!",

That got shot down fast. As much as I appreciate the sentiment and intention, I would not wish anyone the experience of watching an animal they love pass away - It is something that will haunt you. \n\nThe selfish part of me wishes I still had him, but the rest argues that he was in constant pain and that just isn\u2019t a life. And before anyone says \u201cGive him pain killers\u201d that isn\u2019t a solution, it\u2019s a bandaid - and a costly one.

IMO better to separate now when you realize it won't work out than drag it on until she makes a careless mistake that leads to a  tragedy.",

I had my first fish for a few year, but I wasn\u2019t his first owner, and I don\u2019t actually know his age. </p>\n\n<p>When I was 18, I had a house-mate who was actually the owner of the place we lived. One day when I came home from work, he had gotten a fish. I lived with them both for another six months before he sold the place. He was going to be moving out of state and taking a plane... so I offered to spare the fish the stress of travel and keep him! I\u2019m so glad I did, we had many great years together and we shared 5 homes &lt;3</p>\n</div>",

I always pictured someone hyperactive, chasing squirrels and bouncing off the walls. When instead, it was a disabling inability to function on all cylinders. It's like, you think you've got all your plates up and spinning but you keep forgetting about one. Then, everything comes crashing down. \n\nDoes this mean she gets an automatic pass? No. That being said, by abandoning her, you are reenforcing that she is a bad person who doesn't deserve patience and care. It's not your responsibility to fix her, obviously. But -- when you guys have talked about her recklessness, has it been positive? Or, has it been you just pin pointing everything that went wrong? \n\nPeople with ADHD hear those conversations a lot. Can't focus in school? Your teachers are calling home and calling you lazy. Trying to clean your room and find it overwhelming? You're dysfunctional. It eventually gets engrained into your head that you are a bad person no matter how hard you try. Then, out of fear of screwing up, you just stop trying. \n\nHoney catches more ADHD flies than vinegar. We aren't going to react well to negativity. Instead -- you could work on some positive steps together. Put sticky notes up in well trafficked areas with reminders and positive affirmations. (Like, \"Hey! Don't forget to take meat out of the freezer for dinner\" on the fridge and \"I am a really good cook\" on the cabinets). This will help her remember general things and also start to reinforce some positive reminders that she is good at things. Point out when she does something well. Work on finding a therapist and a doctor. Medication changed my life. \n\nBut, I get it. Not everyone wants to sign on to take care of a mentally ill person. If it sounds like too much work to be by her side and support her while she gets help -- it's best you let her go so she can find someone who will. \n\nPoisoning your dog isn't okay. \nHowever, since her inattention isn't a new thing, and you knew there would be drinking and drugs involved; why didn't you take further action to ensure the dog would be okay? I'm not a dog person, but I can't imagine shutting the dog in a room by itself while a party rages outside is going to be very soothing or fun for the dog. Regardless of having ADHD or not, heavy drinking and marijuana (especially marijuana) is going to make your brain unable to make rational, quick decisions. It's no friend to memory. \n\nI don't know, man. I think you should have thought about everything sooner. Why propose or continue the relationship when it seems like her problems have been a heavy burden? Marriage is about being there \"in sickness and in health.\" If you aren't ready to take that seriously, then don't do it.",
