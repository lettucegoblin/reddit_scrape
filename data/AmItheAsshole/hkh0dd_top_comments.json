She dosnt like that you are centre place for you husband. Not her. \n\nYour husband needs to grow a pair here and acknowledge that whatever Mary may have been allowed to get away with before.....that shit stops NOW. \n\nAsk how he would feel if you had a male friend that was allowed to insult him in his own home.while you went away on trips with him?  He needs to step in here...and speak to Mary, with you,  as a couple. You both need to make it clear, that non of this BS is acceptable. She is racist,  offensive, rude and being drunk is never an excuse. She is being nothing more than a toxic bully and that you both have no problem in removing her from your lives.  A friend would not do this to her friends wife.  A husband would not put his friend feelings before his wife.   Ask your husband which woman he has married. You are not playing mistress to her. She sounds like shes trying to play it to you though. Husband needs to stop enabling her behaviour and making excuses. Mary needs to step off entirely until she can learn to be respectful. Or not be welcome at all. Your house. Your rules. Do not let this go.\n\nEdit...just to add...what exactly do you think she would be like if you had children? They would have a mixed heritage....she going to potentially bully them too?  I can just see how this will keep going if you dont stop it....\n\nSecond edit...thankyou kind strangers for the awards x\n\n\nEdit 3: op I have just read your update. Im so sorry you had to find this out in such an awful way. You deserve so much better. Do not think the other wives and girlfriends wont be tearing her down over this, and your husband.  It will re evaluate the whole friendship group. Certainly no female in this group will trust her again. Sending you big internet hugs and I wish you a peaceful recovery from this.

You're \"trying to ruin your husband's life\"?\n\nThis is not a woman who likes you. Alcohol doesn't alter your opinion of someone. It just makes you more likely to blurt out something you shouldn't. \n\nI think this woman is jealous of your relationship with your husband. \n\nClearly, they have talked about you when you aren't there. I'm wondering what's being said that you DON'T know about. It's clear that he doesn't mind her behavior, since he continues to defend it and spend time with her. I feel like his \"talking to her\" may have been along the lines of,  \"Yeah, this is stupid, but you know how my wife is.\"\n\nAlso, I'm really, really disturbed by your husband's use of classic gaslighting and manipulation: \"You're too sensitive.\" Nope. You should NEVER have to debate with your partner whether or not you have the right to feel hurt by something. \n\nWhat's more, you are NOT being too sensitive. Her behavior is gross and you've been very tolerant. \n\nThe racism disturbs me, yes. The dynamic of their friendship disturbs me too, though. She verbally abused you until you broke down sobbing, and he defended HER? \n\nEven the half-hearted apology Mary offered you strikes me as a weak attempt to shut you up so she can keep being around your husband. She made you cry at a party you were hosting and \"half-hearted\" is the best she can muster? \n\nNTA. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Your husband needs to step up. It's a big red flag if he won't.\n\nEdit: Oh geez. Just saw the update. I was really afraid of something like this and I'm so sorry.

I had hoped it was just a case of someone seriously jealous that you got the guy she had secretly wanted (while potentially being in the mids of a mental break down or something like that) and that your husband is just blind to the fact that someone he is close to has a very nasty side to themself. This is so much worse. \n\nI hope you can take some time to heal from this betrayal. I am sending all the virtual hughs i can. After that, i hope that you can put your \"gypsy witch powers\" to good use and get some sweet payback. I'd personally start with talking to the wives of all the other guys in the friends group. Because while your husband and mary were able to use the close friends group as a cover to hide the affair from you, that would not have worked to keep the other guys ignorant. The wives might be very interested to know that their husbands were ok with covering something like that up.",

You aren't being too sensitive, but it DOESN'T MATTER!  Even if you were being too sensitive it is your husband's RESPONSIBILITY to have your back no matter what!!  So what happens when you get pregnant and are all weepy and sensitive due to hormones.  Is he just going to laugh and tell you to suck it up?  I had some really sensitive times when i was pregnant and no matter how ridiculous i was being, my husband was there trying to make things better.  And i mean ridiculous things, like i was in tears about the fact that my hair had gotten too long (by like an inch) and i was ugly and i was going to have to miss work because i couldn't be seen like that in public and the salon was already closed.  I was in the corner of our room just bawling my eyes out (yes, pregnancy hormones are real).  He held me, calmed me down, and went to his sister's house and watched her kids and fed them dinner so she could come over and cut my hair.  This is what a husband should do.  You need to have a serious sit down talk with him.  I agree with others that he should read these responses, but either way you need to talk.  It needs to be somewhere like the kitchen table or in the living room(not the bedroom) where you can sit facing each other.  No distractions.  No cell phones, no tv.  Tell him you want to discuss something that us really hurting you.  Not bothering you, hurting you.  Do not say it is Mary, because truthfully, it isn't.  It is your husband's failure to stop it that is the problem.   Tell him that you are very hurt by the fact that one of his friends is continually making derogatory and degrading comments about, even calling you a whore(and yes, im sure some super close friends may say that, but it is extremely obvious that you and Mary are NOT close like that), and that he seems to think this is ok behavior.  This person is making you feel like shit, and you could ignore that, but the fact that he thinks it is fine for this \"friend\" to treat the woman that he supposedly loves with all his heart in this manner is what hurts you the most.  Make him tell you why that is ok.  When he says you are being too sensitive, put it back on him.  Say, I'm not, but what does it matter if i am.  Im still hurt.  Why don't you have my back?  He should have been the first person to call Mary out on her behavior and put an end to it from day one.  Honestly, you need to ket him know that this is causing you to reconsider your relationship.  I know you have years invested in it, and you truly love him, but you two are going to have much bigger problems you will deal with in the future.  Love isn't everything.  The security in knowing you have someone who will fight by your side no matter what is a much bigger indicator of how the rest of your relationship will go than love.  I once had a teacher tell me something that has stuck with me for over 30 years:  Being in love is a feeling, LOVING someone is a commitment.  He doesn't sound too committed.",

That's not acting on sober thoughts, that's acting on drunk emotion. It's still not okay to get drunk to that point that you can't control yourself, but that's not at all the same as saying \"drunk words are sober thoughts\"",
