It was a hobby and I had the time for it.\n\nSo naturally I brought my goods to work since I didn't want to eat 3 dozen cookies by myself.\n\nEverybody loved them and I was happy until one day I overheard some co-workers talking about how it was weird that I baked so much. Weird? Maybe because I was a 27 year old guy at the time? I was surprised and annoyed. If it's so weird why are you stuffing your face with my weird cookies?\n\nAfter that I was like fuck this and completely stopped bringing baked goods to work. Of course those same co-workers asked why and I told them I just didn't think it was appropriate any more and that was that.\n\nAnyway I love the outcome to this story and wish you the best in all of your baking and non-baking endeavors!",

Idk why it was so important to them, but I stood my ground on it. The pandemic shut down retreats a few months later anyway so it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m still friends with the owner (she\u2019s a much better friend than she was a boss) and her business is actually doing better with the shift to online purchasing.
