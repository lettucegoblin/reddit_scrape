I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls. \n\nWell, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is \"Harry Potter\" themed. \n\nDue to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything).

I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said \"It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.\"\n\nI was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.\n\nI said \"I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together.

I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of \"chasing popularity and doing my nails\" maybe I would have more in common with them.\n\nI'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister.

I&#39;m sorry for that. </p>\n\n<p>I sincerely hope you have a family of choice you can turn to, because that&#39;s the fun part of being an adult.

Frankly, it means being the one who understands and takes the time to hear you when the world turns to shit as you get older, when your parents don't understand you and you need a place to just get away for a little while, when you have boy/girl problems you just can't talk to your parents about... that's where the \"cool\" aunt comes in.

And of course, lots of unstinting praise.\n\nSounds like the the OP is the iron child. If so it would be made clear to everyone in 100 ways that the OP's wants, needs and achievements are secondary.\n\nEvery family tends to have stereotypes - even when relationships are healthy, but in a golden/iron dynamic the stories are very repetitive - the story about the golden child is always positive and the iron child is always comparatively negative. \n\nFacts have nothing to with story that is told. In fact sometimes the gap between the narrative and reality is downright comical.\n\nI'm the iron child in my family, and in my case the story is that I'm incompetent and useless - this is despite the fact that I'm more successful than by golden sibling by pretty much any objective measure. It plays out in lots of weird ways, for example never being seen as responsible enough to host Christmas, even for the 7 years when I was the only person in the family with kids who were still young enough to believe in Santa.\n\nI hate to say it, but the golden/iron child dynamic is pretty difficult to change if you're the iron child. I've learnt to live with it. \n\nAll an iron child can really do is not internalise the bullshit and stand their ground.  \n\nThe OP can also make the underlying narrative as visible as possible (without wasting energy fighting it head on) by saying things like \"When you say I'm \"chasing popularity and doing my nails\" it makes it seem like you see me as YYY, that's interesting because I actually see myself as ZZZ.\" \n\nAn iron child can also spare themselves the guilt trip and give themselves permission to define the relationships by their own terms and avoid situations that make them feel bad.\n\nFailing that, in my experience most people do exactly what the OP did until recently - go low-contact or no-contact. \n\nAnother thing the OP might do if she wants to is spend time with the kids, **but on her own terms.** Chances are very good that one of those children is also an iron child. OP can probably do a lot to make sure the toxic dynamic doesn't pass down to the next generation.\n\nFinal note - this dynamic often sucks for the golden child too.",

If so it would be made clear to everyone in 100 ways that the OP&#39;s wants, needs and achievements are secondary.</p>\n\n<p>Every family tends to have stereotypes - even when relationships are healthy, but in a golden/iron dynamic the stories are very repetitive - the story about the golden child is always positive and the iron child is always comparatively negative. </p>\n\n<p>Facts have nothing to with story that is told. In fact sometimes the gap between the narrative and reality is downright comical.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m the iron child in my family, and in my case the story is that I&#39;m incompetent and useless - this is despite the fact that I&#39;m more successful than by golden sibling by pretty much any objective measure. It plays out in lots of weird ways, for example never being seen as responsible enough to host Christmas, even for the 7 years when I was the only person in the family with kids who were still young enough to believe in Santa.</p>\n\n<p>I hate to say it, but the golden/iron child dynamic is pretty difficult to change if you&#39;re the iron child. I&#39;ve learnt to live with it. </p>\n\n<p>All an iron child can really do is not internalise the bullshit and stand their ground.  </p>\n\n<p>The OP can also make the underlying narrative as visible as possible (without wasting energy fighting it head on) by saying things like &quot;When you say I&#39;m &quot;chasing popularity and doing my nails&quot; it makes it seem like you see me as YYY, that&#39;s interesting because I actually see myself as ZZZ.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>An iron child can also spare themselves the guilt trip and give themselves permission to define the relationships by their own terms and avoid situations that make them feel bad.</p>\n\n<p>Failing that, in my experience most people do exactly what the OP did until recently - go low-contact or no-contact. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing the OP might do if she wants to is spend time with the kids, <strong>but on her own terms.</strong> Chances are very good that one of those children is also an iron child. OP can probably do a lot to make sure the toxic dynamic doesn&#39;t pass down to the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>Final note - this dynamic often sucks for the golden child too.</p>\n</div>",

We = me and the nieces, we'd just take a random June day off school. That's a long trip from Staten Island using only public transportation. I had to go to the store to get all the food, I had to pack and lug almost all the food myself (the kids carried a little), I had to manage them on the train there and back, and in order to make the budget work I didn't even get to go on any of the rides except the Ferris Wheel and once the Carousel. When they were old enough to get around Luna Park without my standing directly behind them at all times I used to bring a book and just sit there for four hours so they could have their fun. I like to read, but I could've done it at home, without lugging a watermelon around.\n\nOh, and you see the part where I packed in a ton of food? Yeah, I also had to remind them, repeatedly, that our budget was fixed and we were not under any circumstances blowing our cash on a. hot dogs b. candy c. cotton candy d. more than one ice cream per person e. toys f. hot dogs (again!) g. sodas h. literally anything and that if they wanted to spend their own allowance or very small allotment of trip cash on these things, fine, but no crying that your sibling didn't share even though you TOTALLY shared your stuff.\n\nWe used to go the Bronx Zoo every year too. That place doesn't have nearly enough water fountains or bathrooms. Went to a whole bunch of museums. It's fun, but you gotta wrangle the kids, and that saps the fun a LOT.",

I had to go to the store to get all the food, I had to pack and lug almost all the food myself (the kids carried a little), I had to manage them on the train there and back, and in order to make the budget work I didn&#39;t even get to go on any of the rides except the Ferris Wheel and once the Carousel. When they were old enough to get around Luna Park without my standing directly behind them at all times I used to bring a book and just sit there for four hours so they could have their fun. I like to read, but I could&#39;ve done it at home, without lugging a watermelon around.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and you see the part where I packed in a ton of food? Yeah, I also had to remind them, repeatedly, that our budget was fixed and we were not under any circumstances blowing our cash on a. hot dogs b. candy c. cotton candy d. more than one ice cream per person e. toys f. hot dogs (again!) g. sodas h. literally anything and that if they wanted to spend their own allowance or very small allotment of trip cash on these things, fine, but no crying that your sibling didn&#39;t share even though you TOTALLY shared your stuff.</p>\n\n<p>We used to go the Bronx Zoo every year too. That place doesn&#39;t have nearly enough water fountains or bathrooms. Went to a whole bunch of museums. It&#39;s fun, but you gotta wrangle the kids, and that saps the fun a LOT.</p>\n</div>",

Nope never done cosplay (except for a couple NSFW with my husband LOL) and the only costumes I make are princess dresses for my 7 year old.\n\nGuess I'm a geek no more and a right proper girl gamer. Oh well, c'est la vie.",
