Even if your sister didn\u2019t steal items herself, she although a guest herself is in the position to monitor her friends and anything they do comes back on her. If she isn\u2019t responsible enough at 17 to respect other peoples property, much less her own families to tell her friends to knock it off then she isn\u2019t to be trusted in your home without supervision. Your wife changing the locks without having a conversation\u2026while she shouldn\u2019t have done this, it\u2019s understandable she\u2019s that desperate. She probably knows from your proven pattern that you would make excuses for your sister and try to \u201cfix\u201d the problem by replacing things. That fixes nothing, that\u2019s a bandaid and the problem hasn\u2019t been resolved. \n\nEven if you assumed your mother would be at the party, this is a shared home between you and your wife. Neither of you should be making unilateral decisions full-stop. Discuss things between the two of you before giving anyone an answer. You don\u2019t get a free pass to do whatever the hell you want in a shared home just because your family asks. It doesn\u2019t matter how close you are to your family, discuss things with your wife (this goes for her too for changing the locks before speaking to you). \n\nAt this point you need to face reality, the fact of the matter is that your sister doesn\u2019t respect you or your home. Even if she didn\u2019t make the mess at the party, it was her party and she could have stayed behind to clean up. She chose not to. Pull your head out and take the rose tented glasses off, your sister is old enough to be held accountable for her actions and should know better. Stop dismissing your wife\u2019s wants and needs. Things regarding shared assets are a 2 yeses one no. If your wife doesn\u2019t want your sister having free access to your home when you guys aren\u2019t there, that\u2019s the end of the story. Your sister doesn\u2019t *need* to be there, so stop acting like her having unsupervised access to your home is a necessity just because she *wants* to be there and knows she can use you to get what she wants. Either you\u2019re married to your wife, or you\u2019re married to your sister\u2026wake up and **figure it out** .\n\nETA. When you do speak to your sister or family and tell them your sister is no longer allowed free access to your home because of her behaviour, I suggest you don\u2019t throw your wife under the bus. State the facts, your sister has **allowed** her friends to be disrespectful in your home and she herself has left your home a mess (she could have chosen to clean up after her friends, especially after you supposedly talk to her about it). Speak as a united front that you as a couple have decided your sister isn\u2019t welcome to use your house like a motel. \n\nP.S. Please stop being so disrespectful and such an ass to your wife.",

Things regarding shared assets are a 2 yeses one no. If your wife doesn\u2019t want your sister having free access to your home when you guys aren\u2019t there, that\u2019s the end of the story. Your sister doesn\u2019t <em>need</em> to be there, so stop acting like her having unsupervised access to your home is a necessity just because she <em>wants</em> to be there and knows she can use you to get what she wants. Either you\u2019re married to your wife, or you\u2019re married to your sister\u2026wake up and <strong>figure it out</strong> .</p>\n\n<p>ETA. When you do speak to your sister or family and tell them your sister is no longer allowed free access to your home because of her behaviour, I suggest you don\u2019t throw your wife under the bus. State the facts, your sister has <strong>allowed</strong> her friends to be disrespectful in your home and she herself has left your home a mess (she could have chosen to clean up after her friends, especially after you supposedly talk to her about it). Speak as a united front that you as a couple have decided your sister isn\u2019t welcome to use your house like a motel. </p>\n\n<p>P.S. Please stop being so disrespectful and such an ass to your wife.</p>\n</div>",

Seems you've established a pattern of not respecting/valuing your wife and that will take a lot of effort to correct.\n\nAs for your sister, having your wife mete out her punishment is great, but I encourage you to think about setting your own boundaries and punishment as well. Not only did she disrespect your wife, she disrespected your relationship by continuously abusing you and your wifes generosity. You don't reward that with special dresses and treatment. Actions have concequences. She wants a dress? have her work for it. She wants half of her cheer costs paid? she can help your wife clean your house, so she fully understands how much work goes into it.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You do not have a sweet sister, what you have is an entitled one, who you are doing nothing to correct.</p>\n\n<p>I get it, there&#39;s a significant age gap between you, and she&#39;s just your cute little sister in your eyes, but what she is doing is massively self-absorbed and entitled and you are hurting both your wife and your sister by letting this behavior continue, possibly at the risk of your marriage.</p>\n\n<p>I saw your update, I&#39;m glad that you tried to right some wrongs, but it&#39;s going to take far more than hiring someone else to clean (is there a reason you chose this route instead of cleaning yourself so you can empathize with how much work/effort it takes your wife to do each time?) and a date night to resolve this. Seems you&#39;ve established a pattern of not respecting/valuing your wife and that will take a lot of effort to correct.</p>\n\n<p>As for your sister, having your wife mete out her punishment is great, but I encourage you to think about setting your own boundaries and punishment as well. Not only did she disrespect your wife, she disrespected your relationship by continuously abusing you and your wifes generosity. You don&#39;t reward that with special dresses and treatment. Actions have concequences. She wants a dress? have her work for it. She wants half of her cheer costs paid? she can help your wife clean your house, so she fully understands how much work goes into it.</p>\n</div>",

Your sister and her friends steal from you on the regular and you defend THEM instead of your wife? Your poor wife does not even feel safe in her own home and STILL you on the side of your sister.</p>\n\n<p>I am not surprised she went to stay with friends because apparently they care more about her then the man she agreed to spend the rest of her life with.  You really need to get a clue, read all the posts here and get a clue or you will be looking for a new wife.</p>\n</div>",

You said you don't believe your sister is stealing? Fine. Maybe it's one of her friends. Either way, allowing it to continue and pretending like replacing the stuff would undo the harm is ridiculous. In order to steal from your wife, someone had to be going through her personally things. That is a major violation, and you tried to manipulate her into acting like it wasn't.\n\nChange the locks so that only you and your wife have copies.  Have a conversation with your wife about what she would like to happen as far as allowing your sister and her friend access to your home/pool going forward; listen to her and do whatever needs to be done so that she feels safe and respected.  Enforce the boundaries the 2 of you come up with. Apologize from the bottom of your heart to your wife for devaluing her and not protecting her from what your sister was doing.

Either way, allowing it to continue and pretending like replacing the stuff would undo the harm is ridiculous. In order to steal from your wife, someone had to be going through her personally things. That is a major violation, and you tried to manipulate her into acting like it wasn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>Change the locks so that only you and your wife have copies.

These kids totally disrespected your wife; they treated her like a maid, they stole from her, they disregarded her at every turn, and you are ok with it???? I hope you enjoy your sister and your pool, as you might not have a wife to enjoy any longer. FFS!  She asked for your help and you didn\u2019t do anything!  She helped herself (new locks), and you trampled over her\u2026yikes.  You are damned lucky if she EVER speaks to you again</p>\n</div>",

The fact that they couldn\u2019t even be told no, I\u2019m sure they were the ones that took your wife\u2019s personal things. You did break her trust. Your family has no regard for anyone\u2019s properties. You have no regard for anybody\u2019s boundaries. Yeah. You and your family are massive assholes. Entitled too.
