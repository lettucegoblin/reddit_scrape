You offered her a drink as an opening to get to know her, not to just buy an expensive round for her and her friends. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t even drink often or get approached really and I know that. Big deal if she was a student, she shouldn&#39;t have tried to pull that shit. It blew up in her face and you dodged a bullet there.</p>\n\n<p>Too bad your mom works with her so now you have to deal with that kind of thing. Just because you have more money it doesn&#39;t mean you have to give her money for her being an asshole and getting expensive drinks for everyone</p>\n</div>",
