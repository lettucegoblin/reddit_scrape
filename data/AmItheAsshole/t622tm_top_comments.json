Now I really only do it for gatherings, first time visits, or visits where I haven't been there in a while (months to years). It's just polite! And I understand not everyone was raised that way so I -never- expect the same when people come to my gathering or to visit me, but I am always super appreciative when someone does! Especially first time visitors - it just means the world to me, ya know? \n\nNow, my mom explained to me when I was young and felt weird doing this going to friends houses for play dates, that it's just something our family does and it's a \"New England\" thing (great-grandmother was from Maine) but I've met New Englanders who don't do this, so I think it's just a generational thing? But I know also a lot of cultures have this as a form of tradition and think poorly on people who don't bring gifts, too. For me it's just the way I was raised.\n\nBut anyway, I think weekly gifts are a little excessive (if you're going for dinner I'd say bringing wine or dessert could be presented as a way to contribute to the meal) but certainly they couldn't possibly be seen as CHARITY lmao.

Sat my bf down after dragging him off his game and grilled him about what was happening but he said I was being crazy when I started all this and to just let us write a text to his parents apologizing. I said no and that we would go over to apologize but he started freaking out which was the final straw. He&#39;s doing everything to get me to stay home but I&#39;m going over and sorting this out since I tried calling anyway but the number&#39;s out of order?  </p>\n\n<p>Some more responses before I leave I&#39;m so sorry I can&#39;t answer everyone:  </p>\n\n<p>My parents are from the Caribbean and he&#39;s very American but he and his family have never been racist or anything before.  </p>\n\n<p>They are actually much more well off than me and my gifts are never expensive since I pay for them on my own which is why I&#39;m now very suspicious of them behaving this way.  </p>\n\n<p>The reason only the dad texted me is because his parents aren&#39;t super tech-savvy and share a simple phone he picked out for them.  </p>\n\n<p>I know there&#39;s a bit of an age gap but I pursued the relationship myself because he asked me out casually at work as a frequent customer and I accepted.</p>\n</div>",

It's not like you were bringing grocery store gift cards or boxes of canned goods.\n\nSuddenly it occurs to me that his father told you not to come to dinner any more, but didn't say why. And your boyfriend went to dinner alone. I'd be interested in knowing what, exactly, your boyfriend said to his parents. Was it really because of the gift-giving, and that you were \"imposing your culture on someone\"? Or did your boyfriend embellish your reasons for not going? Or flat-out lie to his parents to make you look bad?\n\nIn any case, you are a gracious and well-mannered young lady, but you're casting your pearls before swine. You can do better than this. Dump boyfriend and find someone who deserves you.\n\nAnd need I even say it? NTA.\n\nEDIT: Here's an idea. Text his dad back with a link to this reddit column. I'm sure he would find it very edifying to know exactly what we think of him.\n\nEDIT 2: My goodness! I didn't expect this to happen. Thank you for all the awards. I'm overwhelmed.\n\nA couple of you liked the phrase \"casting your pearls before swine.\" Just so you know, that's a paraphrase from the Bible.

Secondly you were, in fact, quite the opposite of TA - you were being a good and gracious guest and following etiquette. I don\u2019t know what (inferiority) complex or chip they have on their shoulders but they are TAs here! \n\nIt\u2019s such a weird thing to get offended about (in fact I know people if you constantly went to their house to eat their food and didn\u2019t bring something that would be seen as bad manners) \n\nThe gifts you brought were absolutely appropriate in thought and size (I thought perhaps from the title you were bringing extravagant gifts each week or if it\u2019s always trinkets/tchotchkes people can feel burdened/have a hard time trying to find a place to put them) \n\nYou are being so sweet and thoughtful to bring a bottle of wine, flowers, a favourite dessert to thank them for the effort in cooking, the hospitality and the food itself.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let this guy or his family\u2019s weirdness and ungraciousness make you doubt yourself for one second!! Or change who you are :) \n\nYou sound like a beautiful soul.",
