THIS is how you repay family for the kindness of letting you recover when you fail for whatever reason, to provide for yourself.  </p>\n\n<p>In my twenties I was pregnant and unwed and my Mom had a horse of a dog (Irish setter) that randomly crapped and vomited that I cleaned up along with her apt.</p>\n\n<p>The entitlement I see on these forums never ceases to amaze me.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Because the OP is a nice human? It\u2019s really thoughtful for OP to pay the cash thinking the  sister may put it aside for a bond etc. We are in a pandemic economy and the sister doesn\u2019t sound super functional. Getting a job is going to be hard. \n\nOP you\u2019re not wrong to be furious because she\u2019s being a dick, BUT homelessness is no joke. Would you consider taking her in again IF she agrees to see a mental health professional weekly, and agrees to apply for x amount of jobs a week etc? If she\u2019s an addict of some kind, maybe require treatment? \n\nOnce someone is on the street (trust me, I\u2019ve been there) things can go south very quickly. Especially for a woman. If your sister is a train wreck AND you want her to get help, that\u2019s not going to happen if she\u2019s on the street. Once you\u2019re there, getting a job becomes basically impossible and she certainly won\u2019t be getting therapy. Literally, I had programs reject me when I was homeless because I couldn\u2019t provide them a permanent address. \u2018Sorry, we don\u2019t take homeless people\u2019. \n\nIMO you should sit her down and tell her you can stay here if X Y Z and if you attempt to abuse my kindness again, you\u2019ll be homeless. \u2018This is your chance to get your shit together and it will be your one chance.\u2019 Maybe try again, let her know you believe in her, and set strict boundaries. Maybe get her info for local therapists/set an appointment time together and even show her classes she could go to if she needs to reskill. She may need someone to just help her remember that she has potential, and someone wanting her to succeed. \n\nIs she religious? from what I\u2019ve seen, church etc can be a good place for her to find some routine, community and activities. \n\nIf she\u2019s not ok, she may just need someone to think of these things for her and remind her that she doesn\u2019t have to be this way. \n\nIt\u2019s your choice OP, you\u2019re the one with the info. But I\u2019m not a fan of everyone on here being so quick to condemn someone they\u2019ve never met, without considering what could be going on. \n\nEdit: Saddens me that people are downvoting this. Why would you want someone on the street if a common ground can be found? It\u2019ll just mean OP loses the sister for good, and the sister loses her chance. The happy ending is both siblings ending up in a good place and neither hating each other, not the sister being in a ditch feeling like people left her there (and that\u2019s how she will feel, regardless of whether it\u2019s fair).\n\nEdit: yes, I know I\u2019m assuming she may have mental health issues and no where else to go, but why are you assuming the opposite?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Because the OP is a nice human? It\u2019s really thoughtful for OP to pay the cash thinking the  sister may put it aside for a bond etc. We are in a pandemic economy and the sister doesn\u2019t sound super functional. Getting a job is going to be hard. </p>\n\n<p>OP you\u2019re not wrong to be furious because she\u2019s being a dick, BUT homelessness is no joke. Would you consider taking her in again IF she agrees to see a mental health professional weekly, and agrees to apply for x amount of jobs a week etc? If she\u2019s an addict of some kind, maybe require treatment? </p>\n\n<p>Once someone is on the street (trust me, I\u2019ve been there) things can go south very quickly. Especially for a woman. If your sister is a train wreck AND you want her to get help, that\u2019s not going to happen if she\u2019s on the street. Once you\u2019re there, getting a job becomes basically impossible and she certainly won\u2019t be getting therapy. Literally, I had programs reject me when I was homeless because I couldn\u2019t provide them a permanent address. \u2018Sorry, we don\u2019t take homeless people\u2019. </p>\n\n<p>IMO you should sit her down and tell her you can stay here if X Y Z and if you attempt to abuse my kindness again, you\u2019ll be homeless. \u2018This is your chance to get your shit together and it will be your one chance.\u2019 Maybe try again, let her know you believe in her, and set strict boundaries. Maybe get her info for local therapists/set an appointment time together and even show her classes she could go to if she needs to reskill. She may need someone to just help her remember that she has potential, and someone wanting her to succeed. </p>\n\n<p>Is she religious? from what I\u2019ve seen, church etc can be a good place for her to find some routine, community and activities. </p>\n\n<p>If she\u2019s not ok, she may just need someone to think of these things for her and remind her that she doesn\u2019t have to be this way. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s your choice OP, you\u2019re the one with the info. But I\u2019m not a fan of everyone on here being so quick to condemn someone they\u2019ve never met, without considering what could be going on. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Saddens me that people are downvoting this.

Her boyfriend got a job at Target and she made friends with his friends working there and got into her head that she wanted to work at Target with all of them, so she did. She ended up slowly dropping all of her courses we'd already paid for and not going to school anymore. Then did the surprise Pikachu face when we charged her rent, of again only 200$ a month.

That way we're not flushing thousands down the drain again. We're also going to encourage a JC then transfer to a UC because we're in California and not only are our UC/CSUs great schools but they have a mandatory acceptance policy if you're applying from a JC.

Obviously that doesn\u2019t apply for abusive situations etc but cutting off a sibling is a big choice, and it\u2019s up to OP if that\u2019s what they want. </p>\n\n<p>The sister is being a dick. But only OP knows if that\u2019s her personality, or a new thing etc, and only OP knows if they are willing to deal with it in the hopes she gets out of this rut. </p>\n\n<p>But kindness is a better quality than self preservation. One day you\u2019ll build so many walls and have identified so much toxicity, that you\u2019ll have a lot of walls, and no one with you.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "> Some people are assholes, but some people are just unwell etc and are doing asshole things.\n\nI'm on board with the sentiment in this thread, because it reflects insights that align with my studies of psychology (i.e. empathy / treating dysfunctional behavior isn't easy but it's often the right thing to do / etc). But I just wanted to suggest that people here don't make a fundamental separation on the point that I quoted.\n\nAnyone who is an asshole is inherently someone who is unwell. To be an asshole is to reflect some sort of cognitive impairment and/or immaturity. To act cold to others is to be cold (and/or stunted) inside. Of course I'm referring to *patterns* of assholery, not necessarily *moments* of assholery (which literally everyone in the world has been guilty of at some point in their adult lives, due to varying reasons--innocent or not). \n\nEither way, there's really no fundamental separation between \"just an asshole\" and \"someone who's good but going through hard times and lashing out.\" A deep technicality of human cognition is that everyone is actually \"good.\" In fact, outside of cognitive science, the only way you can structure a counterargument to that is to rely on religious or superstitious philosophy, because concepts like a soul (or \"outside influence\") are required. There aren't a lot of neurological disorders/illnesses that inherently make people \"bad.\"\n\nI mention this nuance because if you accept the claim that \"some people are just assholes\" then you're treating these people the same way that people are treating OPs sister--they see *her* as the \"just an asshole.\" But there's no line, and that's where the confusion came from in the first place. You can't just back up the line behind OPs sister, but have it put in front everyone else who you have more trouble sympathizing/empathizing with.\n\nKeyword: \"fundamental.\" I acknowledge there's a difference between the assholery of a narcissist versus the assholery of someone \"innocent but on a mental brink.\" Those are obviously different brands of assholery, and the latter is easier to sympathize with. But even narcissists can be treated even if they can't be cured--and those with actual NPD suffer from genetic/environmental factors that they don't control. So as far as \"blame\" goes, it's a tricky concept here at best, or entirely incoherent and inapplicable at worst. \n\nThe further you go down the rabbit hole of psychology, the more sympathy you find for more groups of people. I studied only down to the Bachelor level for my degree and I've since found myself naturally sympathizing with culprits in addition to their victims. I think literally everyone who has a basic background in brain science shares my anecdote about this - it's just the natural conclusion to studying how brains function. Everyone has a story and everyone with bad behavior has a tragic background in genetics and/or environment to explain it. And while not everything can be cured, damn near everything can be treated.\n\nOther than that, I applaud your general input. It's always a breath of fresh air to see people implement their ability to empathize. Unfortunately, empathy is often gatekept by knowledge of behavior/cognition. A lot of people who are exclusively shitting on OPs sister is merely because they don't understand how complex behavior can be - they may have the ability to empathize, but empathy isn't automatic. The things you said in your comment ought to have gone unsaid - but it didn't because those are going to be new thoughts for a lot of people to consider. This is all just one more drop in the bucket for reasons in why brain science needs to be taught in school. The more you understand about how our brains work, in terms of behavioral and cognitive complexity, then the more tools you have to engage empathy in more contexts.",

Not every household can fully spare the finances to pay for everything, to everywhere, and not see the money back- it may be coming from retirement money, or parents may have to take out the same loans the student would but with a much shorter lifespan/time until retirement to be able to pay them back (for the oldest while we had paid cash for the first semester, we probably would've ended up having to take out loans for the UC transfer portion of it when she was out of JC. Even in JC $ we put out about 6k between classes and books and needed supplies for the one semester.)\n\n2. If your family unit is functional/healthy enough that you're willing to help the kids pay for college (and save them the interest in doing so) under the stipulation that your kids pay you back, it's highly likely as macabre as it is, that the money goes back into your estate, and at some point will go to them anyway. \n\n3. The interest on these loans can be what the real hardship is for them. You can take out a 10k loan and end up paying 3x that. I have a friend who took out loans to pay for her own law school, and has paid back 18k more than what the original loans were, never missed a payment, and still owes more money than what she was given. By not making your kids do that you are still saving them THOUSANDS. I'm sure not many people would hear \"I paid for 80k of my students 100k in loans, but that's all I'm willing to do\" as you being a jerk, yet, they're commenting as though that's the case.",

My middle one, 13 I think, needed my help to pick things out, and my fianc\u00e9 was supposed to help the little one...but had no clue where to start, so he kind of just let her go.\n\nShe ended up, from her *share* of this money (remember, split three ways!), getting herself two dresses, two jeans, a few blouses, a pair of sneakers...I don\u2019t remember what all, but it totaled about 10 or 11 different outfits, as combinations! *And* she managed to not spend it all!\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. But she\u2019d been checking every tag, adding things in her head, the whole nine. I was amazed, this was a kid just going into 5th grade, and she\u2019d managed to budget better than adults three times her age!\n\n(Her sisters didn\u2019t do as well, but that\u2019s because they just struggled to find things in their sizes and styles at Marshall\u2019s.)",

My middle one, 13 I think, needed my help to pick things out, and my fianc\u00e9 was supposed to help the little one...but had no clue where to start, so he kind of just let her go.</p>\n\n<p>She ended up, from her <em>share</em> of this money (remember, split three ways!), getting herself two dresses, two jeans, a few blouses, a pair of sneakers...I don\u2019t remember what all, but it totaled about 10 or 11 different outfits, as combinations! <em>And</em> she managed to not spend it all!</p>\n\n<p>I couldn\u2019t believe it. But she\u2019d been checking every tag, adding things in her head, the whole nine. I was amazed, this was a kid just going into 5th grade, and she\u2019d managed to budget better than adults three times her age!</p>\n\n<p>(Her sisters didn\u2019t do as well, but that\u2019s because they just struggled to find things in their sizes and styles at Marshall\u2019s.)</p>\n</div>",
