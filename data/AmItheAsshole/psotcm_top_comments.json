His wife had an OPEN CASKET funeral..gruesome. Nothing derogatory was said or implied during the short service. The widow remained dry eyed but gracious and very classy. Were we shocked? Yep. Was she the AH for not worrying about his dignity in death? Nope.",

This is a complicated situation, and let's be honest, the dad is dead, he doesn't care about what's going on with his tombstone.  The only people being hurt by what the tombstone said are living, breathing, grieving people, and I get it may hurt them to see him dishonored in that way, but it's also all true... So...\n\nPeople of course don't want their loved ones to be remembered solely by the worst things they've ever done, I get that... But regardless of the sentiment of the tombstone, that is what he would still be remembered for to some people.  At the end of the day, changing what the tombstone says doesn't do anything.  It's not really about whether op is right or wrong, it's just about what OP would feel best about doing.\n\nBut also is anything stopping op's dad's family from just getting a second plot with a new tombstone if they care so much?  Does it really matter if there is no body in there?  Genuinely asking, gravesites mean nothing to me so maybe that suggestion is ignorant of me.  I understand if the dad's family wants to be able to visit their loved one's grave without seeing that sentiment, that's reasonable for them to feel... So if that's what they want so badly, I don't see what it matters if the body is there or not.  I don't know if there are rules and restrictions about getting plots or not.",

One is me and my ex, the other I\u2019m friends with both, but they\u2019re not on speaking terms with each other but both want it done for their shared kids, but not so the other has access, which is a headache on its own sometimes.)\n\nFamily genealogy is how my mother\u2019s cousins found out they had a half brother given up for adoption when they were children. My mother and her siblings knew this and just assumed they did too, since they all grew up together. Nope. It\u2019s also how I found out for sure that my great grandfather on that side was an ass and how strong my great grandma (his wife) was to put up with some things he did, but in depression error Arkansas/Oklahoma/Texas panhandle there wasn\u2019t a lot of choices. \n\nThis child would likely find out anyway, especially as they get older and an adult and records become public as they get older. Dates won\u2019t line up and if they requested it, they\u2019d find out there was never a divorce certificate.
