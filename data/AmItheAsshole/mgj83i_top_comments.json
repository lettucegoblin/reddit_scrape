He doesn't have enough money. I'm in medicine school and have been getting ready for my exams for a month now. Every month he and his friends go on a road trip. His car's been sitting in the garage for 3 months now. He asked if he could take my car to take the guys on a road trip since it was his turn to take them. I told him I need the car since I have a weak immune system and public transportation might be risky. And I can't afford to get sick in the middle of my exams. He begged saying his friends are gonna say he ruined the trip and our discussion got nowhere.\n\n\nThe trip was last week. I had an exam the day of the trip and left at 8am. I had several things to do. I stopped by the coffee shop to use the internet. I arrived at the university at 8:30 and entered the hall getting ready for my exam.\n\nAfter I finished. I spent few minutes with my friends then I left. I got to the parking lot and my car wasn't there, I started freaking out. Thinking I might've left the door open or something. I called my husband but he didn't pick up. My friends immediately told me to call The Police. I ended up waiting for them to ask me about what happened. The Officer said I needed to come to the station to give my statement.\n\nI stayed there for 4 hours then I was told my car was found. my husband was driving it and was picked up an hour away from where we live. I was shocked. And mad. It never occured to me that he was the one who took it. I went home and waited til he got back. He was upset and didn't want to talk about what he did. The argument started after he said he made a copy of the key and didn't take til he made sure I arrived for my exam. I yelled at him and told him it was not okay. He caused me to stress out and worry about the car. He told me calling the police was drastic and shouldn't have gotten them involved but I had no idea he took the car. He said he wanted to text me but forgot. Said the trip was ruined and he was embarrassed by being picked up by the police while he was with friends. He still thinks calling the police was over the top reaction but what was I supposed to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "NTA. Jesus.....dump this guy and run like hell. PLEASE. Maybe if he skipped a trip or two he would have enough money to get it fixed. He didn't tell you he took it. You had already told him \"NO.\" You tried to call him and he didn't answer. What the hell else could you do????  You did the only reasonable and logical thing. He knows it. He does. He just doesn't want to admit it. I wonder what his friends think of him for doing it. I have a lot of male friends.....they would SO not be cool with that.\n\nI have a similar story. Two of them, actually.\n\nThe firs was over 25 years ago. I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee. This is important because it's an SUV and far bigger than the car my brother owned, a Ford Taurus. \n\nI get up one day, a day I wasn't working, and did this and that and was on my out to run errands. I open my front door and my car is gone. It was a bright sunny day, I was standing o the top of 8 steps and it was another 3 steps to the car. So CLEARLY, I couldn't miss seeing it immediately. \n\nI called the police. Because when your car is not where you left it and you live alone, well......it's not like the dog borrowed it. The police were nice (I lived in an incredibly small town) and would be a few before they could come over and take a report.....and did I need them to bring me anything? One of them, a friend, said he'd drive over in his car and I could use it for the day. I just sat and waited for them. \n\nThey had already put a BOLO (Be On the LookOut) for my Jeep. About 10 minutes later I get a call from the State Police. This was WAY back in the day before everyone had a  mobile phone and car phones were extremely expensive. They had found my Jeep. The thing is, they guy driving it told them he was my brother, he had a set of keys, had left his car, left note in his car, and honestly didn't \"look\" like a car thief. \n\nI looked out another window.....and there was my brothers car. Hmm. Okay then. My response was, \"How mad is he?\" To which the officer replied, \"Is he known to be violent?\" I just said,  \"Tell him I'm sorry, I love him, and I'm buying him Chinese for dinner tonight.\" \n\nIn my defense, when your car is not where you left it you don't TYPICALLY look for a \"loaner\" car. Yes, we DO laugh about it now. Hell, we laughed about it over Chinese food that night.\n\nThe second story....same brother. I traded my Jeep a few years later about bought a Purple Mustang. Took my youngest niece (his youngest daughter) to a movie. Came out and saw the car and got in. The problem was that the car was parked under the third lamp.....and I was sure I had parked under the first. When I got in, I had to readjust the seat.....it was in an odd configuration that I had come to associate with my brother (really long legs.) Finally, the car SMELLED like my brother had been in it and I had just gotten it that day.....he only had a message about it.....he hadn't even seen it. I finally blurted out, \"I think you dad has been in my car!\" My niece said, \"Thank goodness....I thought it was just me!\" We decided to park a couple of blocks away and walk back to their house. They lived in another tiny town about 5 miles from my tiny town.\n\nWe walk in and my brother is startled because he didn't hear me drive up. The youngest goes to her sisters room. I told him we had left the movie early because it was so bad and when we came out my car was gone. We had been at the police station filling out the report until just a bit ago.....and could he please drive me home? \n\nHe went white as a ghost and muttered something about needing to get his shoes. We hear him on the phone telling dispatch that my car wasn't stolen and I had it. Then he hung up and he and I left, to take me home. He decided to drive by the movie theater (out of the way) because, \"Maybe it came back.\" I told him I'd been waiting for my hover car longer than he'd been waiting for a self-driving car......and to not hold his breath. The car wasn't there. At this point he's low-key freaking the hell out.....and we need to go back to his house because he \"forgot something.\" He goes back to his bedroom and is on the phone talking about yes my car has been stolen and they need to find it fast. While he is on the phone, my oldest niece goes and gets my car and parks it in the carport....slips back into the house and into her room. \n\nThere is a knock on the front door and our friend the confused cop is standing there. Now my brother is trying to tell him my purple mustang was stolen but is trying to do so without admitting that the first report is wrong........sort of. The cop says, \"come here\" and my brother follows him out his front door and they walk 5 feet......to where my car is parked in the carport. The cop says to him, \"Is THIS the stolen car......or is there another purple mustang that is missing? \n\nTo this day my brother STILL refuses to admit he took it for a test drive. \n\nFunny thing, though. My brother never said a single word about me calling the police. Not even once. EITHER TIME (Though I didn't really call them the second time) That is the LOGICAL and EXPECTED action a REASONABLE person would take if their car wasn't where they left it. \n\nYou took the appropriate course of action given the information you had.

Since husband took the car secretly, OP didn&#39;t call the cops <em>on him</em>, she called the cops because her car was missing.  OP&#39;s not psychic.  This man is immature and willing to steal to get what he wants.  That&#39;s one big daggum nope.</p>\n</div>",

It means that you're being accused of a crime by the government, and the punishment might include fines paid to the government, prison, and/or probation.  Ordinary citizens *cannot* press criminal charges against someone.  That's at the sole discretion of the government, though victims will often be asked if they want charges to be pressed, which is a shorthand for, \"We need you as a cooperative witness, and it's not worth our time to pursue this matter if we have to twist your arm here.\"  For many crimes, the District Attorney's office will elect to press charges regardless of whether or not the victim is cooperative. In a criminal trial, a person must be found guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt\".\n\n2. Ordinary citizens can file a civil lawsuit to recoup losses due to a person's actions.  If there are no material losses (loss of property, loss of income, loss of money), then there are no grounds for a civil suit.  If a civil case ends up going to trial, it will be a *civil* trial that is completely separate from any related criminal trial.  The rules there are different, and the defendant can be found guilty \"by a preponderance of the evidence\", which is a lower bar than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\".  Thus it's not at all uncommon for someone to be found not guilty in a criminal trial, but to be found guilty in the attached civil trial.\n\n3.
