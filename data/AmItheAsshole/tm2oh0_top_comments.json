This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (20m) has two younger siblings, \"Joe\" and \"Jill\". They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.\n\nI felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.\n\nAnyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.\n\nI guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad \"nagging her\". When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They&#39;re twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent&#39;s favorite, because they&#39;ve always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he&#39;s the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I&#39;m mostly better off than Joe, as I&#39;m the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.</p>\n\n<p>I felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill&#39;s kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe&#39;s elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill&#39;s princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don&#39;t make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, like I said they&#39;re graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill&#39;s going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe&#39;s going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we&#39;ll find him a job that don&#39;t suck and pays enough, that he&#39;s better off without dad&#39;s money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn&#39;t be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.</p>\n\n<p>I guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn&#39;t want dad &quot;nagging her&quot;. When I told her, politely btw, that I don&#39;t know anyone in SF, and that she&#39;d get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It&#39;s true. I love both of my siblings, but I don&#39;t particularly like Jill. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s making herself likeable, though, so AITA?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There\u2019s a difference between treating others poorly/expecting to be handed everything without effort or gratitude, and voicing what one wants to their parents or siblings (nor is your parents giving into her asks an indication of who she actually is).\n\n2) the best way to see who Jill actually is without your parents doting on her, is to help her find some financial independence.  I\u2019d also keep something in mind, which is that when parents do what they did with your sister, it\u2019s repercussions on her life can be really extensive, and damaging.  \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t play favorites (I felt like they did growing up like a lot of older siblings tend to see it, but looking back I know it wasn\u2019t the case), and I feel super fortunate to have the family I was born into...BUT, my parents were \u201cbulldozer\u201d parents - which are parents that tend to be overly involved or overstep growing autonomy, by too often removing the obstacles in their child\u2019s path, usually out of concern for or protection of their child\u2019s future. And the issue with that parenting style isn\u2019t just that it becomes increasingly stifling as you get older, but it makes it infinitely harder to become a confident, autonomous and self sufficient adult.  Children learn to gain confidence in themselves by trying, failing, and learning to try again bc they haven\u2019t seen failure as something negative or something that will prevent them from succeeding next time (it\u2019s one of the non biased reasons why men tend to climb the career ladder faster than women - bc in childhood, girls are taught and praised for being \u201cgood\u201d, while men are taught to fail fast, i.e. get up and try again). These kids who know how to try again, who\u2019ve learned that mistakes aren\u2019t daunting, learn to grow into adulthood by slowing building the skills needed to create and manage the tedious routines/structure that supports their functioning and adulting.  But when you\u2019re taught to be the perfect Princess, or that your problems need to be solved by Mommy and Daddy, you\u2019re also being taught that no one trusts you to handle it yourself.  This seems small and like a great trade off when it pertains to something like school being paid for, and I\u2019m not minimizing the significance of that, but it\u2019s a terrible trade off when basically tending to most aspects of the rest of your life.  It makes everything on your own anxiety producing.  And often the people who created that environment for you aren\u2019t great at modifying it, so rather than having someone to help you while letting you try what you need to, you at some point just have to feel incredibly alone in diving into those things solo.\n\nSo I get that you feel like your brother got a raw deal, and he did.  But I think that helping your sister navigate ways to be more independent in the ways your parents don\u2019t, isn\u2019t a terrible thing for her to ask her older brother for.  And even if you don\u2019t have friends in SF, I think what she really wants is to feel like she has someone to simply be present and allow her to process out loud a world that she doesn\u2019t know how to navigate on her own yet.  Perhaps you can do a FaceTime call with her and help her start looking (I love having a focus buddy to simply have present while trying new things, it helps it feel less daunting). \n\nJust some thoughts to consider.

My parents did a good fkn job of making sure my sister and myself never realized she was a golden child until we were late teens and even then just a \"something aint right here\"- because every instance of favoritism had an excuse. It wasnt until we were on our own and telling people about \"mundane shit\" and them looking at us horrified. Like i 100% thought it was normal for a parent to beat the shit out of you and then take your siblings out for dinner without you. That was just... Regular punishment for not doing my chores. Why would it be playing favorites if it in theory would be the same if she was as \"bad\" of a kid as i was? (cause it never happened to my sister but i was told thats because she had her shit together and had earned it)\n\nThey also implicate the gc in the abuse a lot of the time. As in my mom had my sister act like my jailor! And its easier to tell yourself that your sister is getting fairly punished and this is normal than to admit you helped your mom abuse your sister and theres nothing you can do to change the situation.  That would make you the golden child as bad as the abuser right? (No but thats what their led to believe)  and you arent a bad person right? So if your not a bad person and you arent an abuser what you just took part in cant be abuse. Its total moon logic mind you but its effective if its consistent from a young age. And the longer you biy in the harder to break out of it.\n\nAnd theres just an element of being surrounded by people who buy into the abuse and having anyone who pushes back to hard weeded out. People called my parents out on their bs? Suddenly they were flakey, or something went missing or... Some reason they cant be around anymore. \n\nParents create reality for their kids and if they do a good enough job that reality can be whatever they want up to an including a reality that has one kid being rightfully treated worse than the other. \n\nAlso- they 100% dont wanna give it up cause they know goddamned good and well if the reality given to them is wrong or they challenge it their status will be revoked and theres really only 2 roles in that dynamic. You are either a golden child or a scapegoat. What golden child who has grown up seeing their sibling treated like a second class citizen wants to join them? So even if they do see the bs its not something they can act on- like my sister stood up for me about 1 and got her clock cleaned for her. After that it was basically the old lady from memoirs of a geisha \"i will beat you and beat you hard so mother doesnt beat you harder\" and bringing me home leftovers. It was better than both of us getting the shit kicked out of us and having 0 advocate at all.",
