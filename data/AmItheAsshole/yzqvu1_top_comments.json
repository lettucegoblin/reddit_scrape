Maybe reflecting some of her attitude back is helpful too, if you\u2019d like to avoid her rebukes for holding your boundaries. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes Mum, we felt bad too as children and wondered why he didn\u2019t feel guilty then (or you for that matter)  so it\u2019s validating to know he is starting to look at his actions. In the meantime I\u2019ve been very reserved with mine. I haven\u2019t even told you what I think of your actions back then!\u201d</p>\n</div>",

Also, if you\u2019re in the states they were breaking the law making opposite gender kids share a bedroom. He was cruel. Malicious. And a monster. And your mother was an enabler who cared more about living in a nice house with a man who treated her kid like basement goblins than about her actual kids. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that they had the gall to approach you about this at all is laughable. How dare they. Also, she\u2019s not your sister. She\u2019s the offspring of the awful man your enabling mother married. She never treated you like a sibling and enjoyed rubbing your nose in the poor conditions in which you were forced to live. </p>\n\n<p>You aren\u2019t an asshole for reminding him of just how awful he was. But your mother deserved equal and more blame than he because she allowed the abuse. They\u2019re fortunate you allow either of them in your life at all. The only assholes in this post are your mother and her husband.</p>\n</div>",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.\n\nWe didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.\n\nSo my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.\n\nI visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant.

When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn&#39;t combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.</p>\n\n<p>So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum&#39;s share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn&#39;t for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn&#39;t need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn&#39;t call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she&#39;s pregnant. He asked me if I&#39;m able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he&#39;d pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.</p>\n\n<p>I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he&#39;s offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we&#39;re able to, I replied back &quot;like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he&#39;d have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that&#39;s good of you but doesn&#39;t make you entitled to my money now.

It's a copout used by people trying to manipulate their way out of being held accountable by the people they've wronged. From what I can tell, he's only said that because he wants your money, not because he's actually remorseful about his behavior towards you and your brother. If he actually felt guilty for his actions, he wouldn't have waited until he wanted something from you to make an apology (that wasn't even real). Don't give him a pass. I'd wager that if they never get your money, they're eventually going to shift gears and show you just how unapologetic they've always been. \n\nI'm sorry you and your brother experienced so much mistreatment. You two didn't deserve any of it, and you don't deserve pathetic excuses and fake apologies for the abuse now.

He must be pretty dense if he thinks you believe that lie.</p>\n\n<p>NTA. So glad you and your brother are doing well. Remember that you are not responsible for these people when they get too old to care for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: thank you kind person for the award.</p>\n</div>",

She got takeout and ice cream and gifts. We got starved to the point we had to sneak food overnight. He doted on her left and right. The other kids were treated at least halfway decently, while I suffered physical abuse. I remember one time going out and we stopped somewhere, and he told me to stay in the car. I sat there for about an hour. When they got back, I discovered he had taken them in to eat at a restaurant while I sat outside in the heat and got nothing.\n\nThere is no excuse for my mother allowing this to go on. I wish I could say things got better when she left him, but they didn't. When she finally did for good, I was an adult and went to stay with her because I was pregnant and alone and too sick to work. She kicked me out so she could live with her new alcoholic, sexual assaulting boyfriend.\n\nI love my mother, and I've grown to understand her more over the years, but there is no excuse for her allowing what happened to continue over the years. For accepting the unfair treatment, and always letting her kids come last. I've never been able to forgive her for it.\n\nEdit: I shouldn't say she's *always* let us come last, that was unfair. She has made some painful decisions to make sure her children were properly cared for at times. I should say that there have been far too many occasions where we came last, especially me, as the other two easily had better treatment than I did, and even to this day she is more likely to choose them over me.",

My Mom had two teenagers and younger child.\n\nBob had a great job with a bank and had a nice house in a nice neighborhood. We kids shared two bedrooms upstairs with Mom and Bob while his kids got the basement apartment. Bob's kids got new clothes and stuff for school, we got what Mom could afford on her factory job. At 17 I moved out, and then confronted Mom about how she let Bob treat us. Mom's excuse was she knew he favored his own children but that was what they agreed when they got married, and she married Bob for us, to give us a better life. And we did have a better life than what she could give us alone. I think a lot of parents do this on both sides, take up with someone that doesn't always do the right thing but the parent fools themselves into thinking their kids are better off. I'd have rather continued to live in the single wide trailer with Mom and it just be the four of us than the two years of hell I had with Bob. He eventually took off with the next door neighbor's wife, who left her kids behind. He left my Mom in his house but abandoned the mortgage and her attorney told her not to pay it because the house wasn't in her name so they ended up in an even shittier single wide in a worse trailer park for a while. Parents, don't marry someone just to give your kids a better life. That never works.",

It does *not* excuse what she did, but I know now that she was a victim as well, and I know she never did anything out of any sort of malicious intent. Maybe it's silly of me to still care. Maybe I'm latching on still out of some foolish hope that our relationship will mend. There are a lot of confusing emotions.
