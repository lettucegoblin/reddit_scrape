This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\n\n\nMy daughter (16) Megan just finished her cancer treatment, she's lost her hair in the process and she's been incredibly insecure because of it. She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just \"harmless teasing\".\n\n\nMy husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.\n\n\n\nWe went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Mrgan yelled then took her wig and run after Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset eswhrn I looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just \"kids teasing each other\" and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable.

She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It&#39;s been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just &quot;harmless teasing&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>My husband&#39;s sister&#39;s wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn&#39;t want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don&#39;t know why.</p>\n\n<p>We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Mrgan yelled then took her wig and run after Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset eswhrn I looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn&#39;t have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn&#39;t respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must&#39;ve ruined what&#39;s left of her self esteem. He said that it was just &quot;kids teasing each other&quot; and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable.

He clearly doesn't have any decent role models and bullying his step sister who is only 2 years younger than him seems to be something he enjoys for some reason.

What is happening here is abusive, by both adult &quot;men&quot; who are in her life who should be proving she can trust them to protect her.. not humiliate, belittle, and publicly shame and embarrass a cancer survivor who is also a minor.</p>\n\n<p>This treatment shown by your adult stepson and your adult husband, as well as anyone who laughed at her and did not come to her immediate defense is abusive and completely unacceptable. Even if she had shaved her head for other reasons, it&#39;s still unacceptable to mock and shame someone who is trying to figure out how to be comfortable in her own skin.</p>\n\n<p>She deserves to be surrounded by people who make her feel safe, not bullied. NTA for protecting and defending your daughter, but YWBTA if you continue to keep her in a home environment where she is clearly not safe from cruel tactics of destroying her entire self esteem.
