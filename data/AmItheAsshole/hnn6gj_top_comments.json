I cracked the shits and threw the empty plastic bottle at the back of his head and he freaked out coz he didn't realize anyone was there. Dumped him a couple weeks later. When custody become an issue he claimed I was abusive using the fact I threw a bottle at his head, I explained the whole thing and even his lawyer gave him a \"wtf\" look.

However, after a game round if I\u2019m in the other room or somewhere he can\u2019t see me he will typically check on me. Even if he can see me he tends to check on me, ask if I need anything etc. It makes me feel like he\u2019s thinking about me too which is kinda nice (: If he was to play the way your SO does and not check in for a straight four hours then I would probably ask that he does check on me too! Especially when you have kids or if something was to happen and he can\u2019t hear at all. He could easily check on you while coming back from a break to the bathroom, or a snack break, it only takes a few seconds of his time to check in while doing those things. You didn\u2019t overreact, that\u2019s safety stuff and a totally reasonable thing to ask for!</p>\n</div>",

I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine.

When we get up for bathroom/snacks we talk to each other, check in, give kisses. Even before we had this setup and we were gaming in separate rooms we did this.\n\nOp: His reaction was very defensive. Unless theres some additional info where it's been a sore spot (you having an issue with him gaming/how long he games for) he could either have some suppressed guilt regarding how much he plays OR he is developing a bit of an addiction where he's reacting to limits being put on his gaming (checking on you).\n\nDoes he get grumpy/snappy if interrupted while gaming - even when doing mundane things? The bf and I each get a little frustrated when we interrupt each other while in an online match and such but we regularly chat with each other while farming/building bases. \n\nIf so you need to sit him down and talk to him because it's all too easy to get checked out of reality when playing an mmorpg, especially modern ones where theres just so much to do instead of just leveling/questing. He is your partner and his concern for you should always come before a game. If he reacts poorly I suggest counseling together and separately.\n\nEdit: I read my boyfriend this post and he immediately remembered a post about a man who gamed with noise cancelling headphones and someone broke into his home and attacked his wife and daughter and he had absolutely no idea it was happening until he got up for a bathroom break and heard his wife screaming and crying. He ended up shooting the attacker and the whole family has (understandable) emotional and mental trauma from it. \n\nI know this is an extreme example but it does highlight the importance of being present for your partner*. I once choked while eating dinner upstairs in our house and couldnt call for my bf so I pounded on the floor. He called out my name and I pounded again and he came flying up the stairs to see what was wrong. This is what partners do, they look out for each other.\n\nEdit 2: * AND PARENT. I keep forgetting there is also a kid involved. Parenting is (usually) a team sport and you cant just check out like that. My sister and her husband got engaged then got pregnant 3 months later.  Baby was 3 months old when the wedding happened.

I'd recommend putting down these blinders you have for relationships and others. It's kinda unhealthy going off what you've said here.

Also using a throwaway because the victim is another redditor who could be identified through my normal ID.\n\nBack in 1995 I lived in a quiet neighborhood in the SF East Bay with my wife of a few years and our 20 month old daughter. We had a small 3 bedroom two story house, and one of our second floor bedrooms doubled as my home office. One quiet Saturday morning I was in my office playing Command and Conquer on my computer with my headphones on, oblivious to the sounds of the outside world.\n\nI'd probably been playing for an hour or so when, during one particularly quiet moment, I faintly heard my wife cry out downstairs. Knowing that she was down there with our daughter, I pulled my headphones off to see if she needed help with anything. Until the day I take my last breath, I'll never forget what I heard when I pulled them off. I heard the voice of a man, with a thick Mexican accent, shout, \"Quit yelling bitch, or I'll fucking cut your head off and fuck your fucking daughter!\" My daughter was crying hysterically.\n\nAfter that, it was like some switch was thrown in me and my higher brain just shut off. I wasn't making decisions. I just acted. I don't even remember pulling the .45 from the lockbox in my desk, I just remember walking down the stairs slowly, scared as hell that I was going to see my wife dead when I reached the bottom. Instead, when I reached the bottom, I saw my wife half naked, bent over the couch, bleeding from somewhere in her upper body, while being raped from behind by some burly guy with a knife in his hand. He wasn't TRYING to rape her, he was in the middle of the deed and was probably nearing climax.\n\nI never said a word to the guy. Not while I was upstairs, not while I was coming down the stairs, and not when I walked into the room. His back was to me, so he had no idea I was even standing there.\n\nHe was holding his knife in his right hand, so that was the arm I grabbed with my left when I pulled him off. He spun away from her and me with a confused look on his face, and I shot him square in the chest at nearly point blank range before he had a chance to say a single word. His face went pale as he went onto one knee, and I fired twice more. One hit his neck, and the second missed entirely. I was told later that the first shot was the fatal one.\n\nWhat happened next has always been a point of shame for me. The only thought going through my head at that point was that I couldn't let my daughter watch this man die. Without even checking on my wife, I scooped my daughter up and walked out my front door. As I walked out to my driveway, I saw one of my neighbors standing there staring at my house (he'd heard the gunshots). The poor guy went pale when he saw me walk out, and I vaguely remember asking him to hold my daughter while I went and checked on my wife. The neighbor asked me if I'd shot her, and I told him, \"No, I shot the man who was raping her.\" I didn't realize at the time that I had the guys blood spray covering half my body, and that I looked like something out of a horror movie. I then handed him my daughter and my gun (I also have no idea why I gave him my gun), and went back into my house to help my wife.\n\nThe police and DA gave me some flak about the exact circumstances of the shooting (one of the detectives told me that it was more of an \"execution\" than a \"defense\"), but in the end they declined to pursue any charges. The man who attacked her turned out to be a guy with serious mental issues who had been previously convicted of two violent rapes, one of which was against a 9 year old girl. Under California's then-new 3 Strikes law, he'd have gone to prison for life if I hadn't killed him.\n\nAs for recovery; I like to think that I've recovered from it, but it certainly induced a few behavioral changes. To this day, for example, I can't wear headphones that block out background noise. Even after years of counseling, over-ear and noise cancelling headphones give me panic attacks because I can't hear what's happening around me. I found out later that he'd been raping my wife for nearly 10 minutes before I heard him, and that he'd actually told my wife THREE TIMES that he was going to rape my daughter when he was finished with her. I was sitting 30 feet away and had no idea it was going on, and that fact has fucked with me for years.\n\nMy wife had a much worse time of it though. In addition to two stab wounds to her shoulder and upper arm, and the bruising and injuries from the forceful rape, she ended up having a mental break and took years to really recover. For the first 6 months, she absolutely could not be in any room by herself. For more than a year, she couldn't be in a house by herself (and she NEVER reentered the house where this happened). For several years, she'd break out in a sweat when she heard men with deep hispanic accents talking, because she'd hear his voice again. Even now, decades later, she starts shaking if you try to talk to her about it. She's fine in every other sense, but even discussing it freaks her out.*",

One time I came home and had cut my hand on some sharp plastic in the car and was rushing to put pressure on it, and was yelling for him to come help me with the dog so I didn't bleed all over the carpet.

I could've hit my head or been seriously hurt and he *never* would have noticed. I've tried to talk to him about keeping one ear out of the headphones or playing music a little quiter but he doesn't want to. I may just have to finally send him that story and be like look dude. You never check your texts and you can't hear me when I yell- what if I'm seriously hurt??",

Men take for granted our unseen mental workload and by the time you have time to give some stupid villager the bug they want in Animal Crossing it\u2019s more rewarding to just fucking go to bed.</p>\n</div>",

The alarm was the loudest thing I've ever heard and it was combined with a crazy strobe light. We ran the dorms as hotels for summer campers (13-17 year olds) during summer quarter, and amazingly, there were several occasions when I would do a room check during an evacuation and find some teenage boy (it was always a dude, no clue why) still totally asleep through the alarm. When I say this alarm was loud... I can't even express how loud this alarm was. If you were inside the dorm it was going off in it was basically deafening. You could hear the alarms from other buildings on campus. And this was UCLA, so, not like some small town where the fire alarm was the only loud noise going on. I guess my point with all this is... he could get a visible component to the fire alarm, but seeing as how he's tuning out the phone vibrating on his lap, he might be like those camp kids I found sleeping through the world's loudest fire alarm and strobe lights.",
