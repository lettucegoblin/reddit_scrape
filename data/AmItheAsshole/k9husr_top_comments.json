Her children also have their own (unmarried, no other children) father providing for them, and he has quite a lucrative job. This situation has severely impacted my relationship with my father.

If your daughter, his stepdaughter, feels loved and included in the family, she may have a close relationship with him and his children and they may benefit. \n\nThere is still plenty of time to make money for the benefit of his children and to raise them so that they get college scholarships, and earn excellent livings.",

In contrast, if the daughter were to inherit the home when the mother dies the daughter will get an automatic stepped up in cost basis to whatever the home is worth at the time of death.  So if the house cost OP say $250K and she gifted the house today, the daughter would inherit the same $250K cost basis and say the daughter sold the house the next day for $1M, ignoring agent fees and other costs, the daughter would need to pay capital gains of the difference of $750K.  In contrast if she inherited the house and the value of the house was worth $1M at the time of death and the daughter sold it right after inheriting it and their was no appreciation, then the daughter would pay no capital gains tax.\n\nThe best option for the OP is to consult an attorney.  Likely she should look into placing the house into a trust and naming the daughter the beneficiary.  This would not only move the house out of the OP\u2019s name, but would bypass probate which is long and expensive process in itself, and allow the house to pass onto the daughter with the stepped up basis while allowing the daughter to inherit the low property tax.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, this subthread is the most important one I think. There are NAH, but both OP and fiance&#39;s concerns are valid: OP should be able to bequeath the asset she brought into the marriage to the child she already had (noting, also, that OP&#39;s adult daughter only has one parent to leave her anything, and fiance&#39;s kids will potentially have four adults to love, care and invest in them during their childhood and be included in their wills) but it&#39;s fair for fiance to expect OP to become a significant part of his kids&#39; lives (as she indicates she wants to) and consider them part of their shared future and family. If OP&#39;s daughter is getting the house, OP and fiance, as well as fiance&#39;s ex, should plan together to ensure that OP&#39;s kids will get a reasonable inheritance as well.</p>\n</div>",
