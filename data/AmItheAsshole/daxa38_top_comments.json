This is abusive, negligent, manipulative, traitorous, irresponsible. You were 20, so, by no means a child, but you trusted them that they would let you live with them, and you hadn\u2019t necessarily made plans to live elsewhere. I consider a move like this to be pulling the rug out from under your feet.\n\nYour father sure was petty, though. Seems to me he was less worried about your safety and a lot more worried about being the one in power.\n\nParents are supposed to be supporting. If your father was worried that J was using the age gap to exploit you or take advantage of you, he shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out, right into J\u2019s arms. A 10-second google search, or perhaps a quick consultation with some friends if I consider the time this happened, can educate people on how to treat people who are in an abusive relationship. And, of course, seems like you were definitely in a healthy relationship with a peer who was pretty much at the same stage of life that you were - college.\n\nYour brother hears mostly your parents\u2019 point of view, unfortunately. He can\u2019t force you and your parents in the same room. To avoid conflict, I\u2019d say avoid this conversation with him. You\u2019re family but your relationship with your parents is not something he should be worrying about.\n\nMy dad kicked me out over dishes I had cleaned but had left out to dry. Mom supported his decision because he lied to her about why he did it. I didn\u2019t find this out until over a year later when I made her apologize to me for all the manipulative things she does on her own. She apologized but I found that I just don\u2019t care. My parents continually abandon me or my sister when we don\u2019t show perfect obedience. They weren\u2019t there for me during the hardest times of my life. I didn\u2019t need them at my worst, I don\u2019t need them at my best. I keep distant contact with them and never put myself in a position where I\u2019m trapped with them. I like it well enough.\n\nFor some people, reconnecting with family can be a good thing. But you have to decide for yourself if letting fickle, fair-weathered people back into your life will make you happy. It sounds like you\u2019re doing really well for yourself (congratulations, by the way!) You don\u2019t have to let manipulative people back into your life, not even to appease your brother. If he can\u2019t be happy for you and respect your wishes, there\u2019s little more you can do for him other than respectfully offering him a person he can talk to and connect with if he wants.\n\nIf you want to see your parents again and give them the chance to be good grandparents, then consider it. Maybe meet in a public place without your baby, bringing J along, to see if they really are willing to make things work. But, again, only if it would make you happy. Life is too short to spend it with people who don\u2019t make you happy, or worse, betrayed you and make you unhappy and somehow convinced your brother to get mad at you for their dumb decisions.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that you and J will be much better parents. Congrats, really! You\u2019re doing so well! And you\u2019re definitely not the asshole.",

Only after that they probably sent your brother with that message because they dont know how to reach you and make amends. You can still deny the opportunity to let them try to make amends, but in this case you are petty because it is clear they are willing to say sorry and accept their mistakes. Plus you are denying your daughter of the love of grandparents just because you after several years dont want to give them neither the chance to say sorry. You can let your daughter have a relationship with them and still not let them have one with you, if you really dont want to forgive them, that is understandable, but doing so you are showing your daughter that one mistake in life is forever and even if people want to change and do better it is pointless.</p>\n\n<p>edit: people that downvote to oblivion the other comments that support my judgment just because they must project their toxic relationships with parents on every story let me speechless. It is always nice to express a different opinion on this sub...</p>\n</div>",

They overreacted, pure and simple. You\u2019ve lived your life and started a family and now they want back in. \n\nI\u2019m sure there is tons of regret from your parents for their actions but to refuse to let them see their grandchild is just selfish of you. You\u2019re holding onto a grudge, and that is not healthy. You\u2019ve kept them out of your life, probably refusing to communicate with them, and their only way of finding anything out about your life now solely comes from your younger brother. And now you\u2019re threatening to kick him out of your life. \n\nNow you\u2019re the one overreacting and are being unreasonable to your family wanting you back in their lives. You\u2019re in your late 40\u2019s and your parents aren\u2019t going to be around that much longer. And believe me when I say this, you do not want bad blood between you when they die. You\u2019ll be filled with regret, or maybe you won\u2019t, but that shit will stick with you for a very long time if you don\u2019t fix this issue with your family. \n\nMost people get 2 families in their lives, the one you\u2019re born with and the one you choose.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo OP left out some vital information from her original post and people have replied to my comment to inform me of the rest of the info. So I\u2019ll update my answer to reflect this new information. \n\nESH. Especially the parents for kicking you out and removing you from the will. That\u2019s some pretty petty shit to do to your own child.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear to me if the parents made any attempts to make contact and try to mend the relationship. If OP refuses any attempts from her parents, than that\u2019s an asshole move. If the parents made no attempt until they found out about the child, that\u2019s an asshole move. \n\nThreatening your younger brother to kick him out of your life for trying to mend the relationship between both you and your parents, is an asshole move. He\u2019s done nothing wrong, and wanting his sister and his parents to work things out is not his fault and does not make him against you. He\u2019s not the asshole. \n\nI still stand on my comment about holding a grudge, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. And holding a grudge is very toxic, just let it go. You don\u2019t need to forgive your parents, but you don\u2019t need to hold a grudge against them either. That\u2019s an asshole thing to do. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s up to you if want your parents to be in your child\u2019s life. If they think they did nothing wrong, if they refuse to apologize or refuse to put you and your family back in the will, then fuck them. They don\u2019t deserve to be in your family.

If you cut it at any step, all the others will stop eventually.\n\nIf you manage to return hate with love, you'll be a happier person.\n\nI've seen parents treating their children way worse and still manage to repair their relationship. Like, there was this gal whose father was alcoholic. Her mother got cancer, and she had to provide for her family, take care of her brothers and her mother's treatment, all while her father kept drinking and bringing hookers into their home. He eventually left. Fastforward a few decades later and she's in the hospital crying because her father might not make it, his kidneys and liver are completely destroyed... Alcohol does that to your body. She was devastated. Even after all her father put her through, she managed to forgive him and even mourn him. She never completely forgave him. But she was happy, because she managed to repair her relationship with her father, granted, she was 40 when it happened, but at least they got a chance to be a family. Luckily, he somehow managed to survive. They still don't talk all that much, but every now and then she calls him, checks on him, and all that stuff. She is in peace with herself.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that you can't rewind time. Time goes on, and your parents will not be there forever. Even if it takes a big compromise from your side, you should give them a chance, and be the bigger person in the situation. They probably feel guilty and terrible already, and let me tell you, kids don't come with an instruction manual, when they did what they did, they probably freaked out and acted irrationally. I bet you that they regret their actions, because there's no parent in this world who doesn't love their child. I'm guessing that as a mother you'll understand.\n\nJust cut the cycle.\n\nBe the bigger person.",

People are going to do what they are going to do, especially young adults that think they have it figured out, so making sure they know they can turn to you for help if things go wrong is far more helpful than kicking them out and disowning them, giving them nowhere to go to get out of a bad situation safely.",

But instead of disowning or kicking them out right into the hands of the person they shouldn&#39;t be dating, a much better approach would be to have serious, detailed conversations about <em>why</em> you have a problem with it and make sure they know that they can rely on you if and when they need help.

I made a general statement stating that it\u2019s hard for people to understand people living with emotional  abuse if you\u2019ve experienced it, and even harder if you haven\u2019t.\n\nVerbal abuse doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of attention, people can say it\u2019s \u2018just words\u2019 or spin it into them being like that because they love you so much. Some people have a hard time even realizing they\u2019re being abused even as they\u2019re actively being isolated from friends, family, privacy, and money. Some abusers completely deny that they\u2019re even a little bit abusive.\n\nPhysical abuse is horrible. It\u2019s also very clearly wrong and you cannot make any excuses for putting your hands on a person that you love. There\u2019s no way to have anyone believe \u2018I beat the shit out of you because I just love you so much.\u2019 \n\nWhen you\u2019re being physically abused you don\u2019t think \u2018I think I just got slapped across the face by my partner but maybe I\u2019m confused, maybe I just ran into the wall and forgot..\u2019 \n\nI\u2019m not saying this to diminish physical abuses impact on anyone - at all - it\u2019s a lot easier to recognize and harder to ignore. There\u2019s no way to pretend that physical abuse isn\u2019t happening when it is. Even as you\u2019re lying to the ER doctors about how you broke your nose *you know the truth*. It\u2019s a lot harder for the abuser to gaslight you into thinking it\u2019s not actually happening. \n\nVerbal abuse is a lot harder for some people to recognize and really easy for people to make excuses for - both from the victim and the abuser. And that\u2019s exactly how it\u2019s designed. In an emotionally abusive relationship you\u2019re made to feel like the abuse is your fault if only you didn\u2019t piss them off, or cleaned the house right, or didn\u2019t talk back, or did some impossible task demanded of you - that was 100% designed for you to fail. \n\nIt\u2019s earth shattering going through this with a partner/husband/wife/SO. If this is coming from your parents it\u2019s likely been happening your entire life. And it\u2019s logical that all the you want is their approval and acceptance. Even though they\u2019ll never give it. Even if you realize how fucked up they are. Even if you hate them. It\u2019s been drilled into you for as long as you can remember that they\u2019re your parents and they are never wrong.\n\nVictims are conditioned to think that them controlling everything in your life is okay, and not only normal but necessary. \n\nThat it\u2019s not abuse.\nThat they\u2019re taking care of you. \nThat it\u2019s for your own good. \nThat it\u2019s okay because they don\u2019t hit you. \nThat it\u2019s just words. \nThat they\u2019re just overprotective.\nThat it\u2019s your fault that they are this way.\nThat you make them act like that. \n\nI cannot begin to imagine being raised with the level of abuse that OP described. This guy probably doesn\u2019t know what a normal, healthy relationship with parents should look like. Abusive situations are different for everyone but I imagine that even though he probably doesn\u2019t even like his parents the threat of losing that relationship is probably pretty terrifying. When you\u2019re in an abusive relationship the abuser makes sure that your world completely revolves around them. Even if you feel negatively about it and it\u2019s horrible, losing that relationship is basically losing everything you\u2019ve ever known. \n\nHis whole life he\u2019s probably excused their behavior as them just being strict. If you say/hear something enough it becomes engrained and even if you don\u2019t necessarily believe it, it becomes your truth. It\u2019s even scarier realizing how abusive they really are and that everything you\u2019ve known your entire life has been lies and coverups for their abuse. \n\nSome people can\u2019t handle realizing that the abuser(s) are just horrible people and everything you thought and were made to believe is a lie even if that means seeing yourself for who you really are and not this person they\u2019ve convinced you you are. \n\nThen if you can accept all that you get to live with the shame that you let these horrible things happen to you. That you didn\u2019t even realize how bad it was. I\u2019ve never felt more ashamed and stupid than when I realized I let some piece of shit convince me that I was lucky he cared enough to try to fix me. That I actually thought I was this horrible person that no one would ever want. \n\nWhen I was in that situation I stayed for 10 years because he didn\u2019t hit me very often. Had he been more physical I would have not second guessed myself and would have left years before I finally escaped. I don\u2019t have any lasting scars from the times it did get physical, but it took me *years* to unwrap the mind fuck I was left with.",
