Second, get into family counseling and have a professional help you work through telling your daughter the truth while she is still young, and for explaining to your kids why they don&#39;t see grandma anymore.if you do choose to cut her off. I know enough kids that found out their dad wasn&#39;t their biological father when some asshole decided to blurt it out when the kid (or parent) pissed them off and it wrecked those kids. Especially now that your mom has gone and told everyone else, if you do end up letting her come around, or even if you cut her off but keep the relationships with your other family members, it just takes one slip from an angry or drunk relative to ruin everything. The younger she is when she finds out the easier it will be for her to process, especially if you get her in counseling and tell her in a calm moment and let her know that it doesn&#39;t change anything about your relationship and how much you love her.</p>\n</div>",

We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.\n\nVisibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.\n\nMy mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.\n\nThen a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.\n\nLast week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.\n\nIt's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her \"special little guy\" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.\n\nI feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her &quot;special little guy&quot; so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can&#39;t justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.</p>\n\n<p>I feel I&#39;m in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I&#39;m seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>You may not care if it\u2019s your bio daughter but that other person may have had their child basically stolen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In UK law, the husband of the birth mother and father on the birth certificate is the legal father.  He says he found out <em>before</em> the birth, and is almost certainly on the certificate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>They should absolutely tell the daughter for medical reasons</strong>, and I can see an ethical reason to tell the biological father.  But as far as UK law is concerned, can&#39;t have what was stolen what was never his, and that&#39;d make it legally difficult to force the OP to disclose that.  Given he fully sees himself as the father I can&#39;t really blame him for wanting to meet the reminder of their messy break any more than the wife wants to meet anyone OP hooked up with in that time, or make things confusing for his young daughter.  That&#39;s maybe something just to wait for her to be old enough to decide on her own.</p>\n</div>",

I've had to explain that all to my family when they've tried to do these kits.\n\nTo make it even more complicated- it is genetically possible for a blue/green eyed pairing to have a child that 'reverts' back to brown. Since Brown (and the many shades of brown there are- from near black to amber) is the 'natural' eye color of humans, there is a slight chance the original 'blue' mutation from your wife reverted back to the natural brown.

The State would consider you her father, paternity tests don't change that! (This is a situation where the laws have not caught up with technology, a paternity test matters getting on a birth certificate- as long as the 'father' portion is blank- but it would take *far more* than that to get removed from one.)\n\nNTA; consider putting the rest of your family on read for a few months, just for some piece of mind.",

I say this on the assumption that in sending off the DNA for testing she probably needed to confirm that both parties had consented, or where one or more of the parties was a child incapable of consenting, that someone with parental responsibility had consented.\n\nDoing a DNA test is an activity which requires consent under the Human Tissue Act 2004. Specifically, section 1(f) requires consent for the use of material that has come from a human body  if that use is listed in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 is obtaining scientific or medical information about a living person which maybe relevant to any other person. My assumption is that this includes DNA tests. \n\nSection 2(3) of the Act requires consent for a young child (well more specifically from a child who is not competent to deal with the issue of consent) to come from someone with parental responsibility. In this instance I\u2019m pretty sure this would be limited to you and your wife. Your mother WOULD NOT have parental responsibility. Looking after a child temporarily would not be sufficient to establish parental responsibility. \n\nSection 5(2) of the Act states that it is an offence for someone to falsely represent to someone they know is undertaking certain activities that there is appropriate consent to the activity. This includes someone telling a DNA company that consent has been given by all parties submitting DNA for testing, or where it\u2019s a child who can\u2019t give consent, that the person with parental responsibility has given consent. \n\nIt\u2019s also an offence under section 45 to \u201chave any bodily material\u201d that you intend to test for DNA without qualifying consent (for a child, again it\u2019s consent from someone with parental responsibility) except in limited circumstances (mainly related to medical treatment, investigating crimes, prosecuting offences etc, not establishing paternity). This would mainly be to catch someone who\u2019s collected bodily material for a DNA test illegally, but before they\u2019ve actually sent it off. So if you\u2019d caught your mother with your child\u2019s material before she\u2019d sent it in this could apply but I don\u2019t think this is relevant here after she\u2019s already sent it off.
