        "body": "I'm going to get down-voted by this, but I sure hope you read it:\n\nYou are overreacting in almost every step of this entire thing. You have been married to your wife for 4 years. I don't know your wife's family dynamic, but if she is particularly close with her parents, you're expecting her to pick you 100% over her entire life's relationship with her parents. Are her parents weird religious freaks? Probably. Should this situation have never even happened? Sure, obviously. But you have NO IDEA how difficult it can be for a spouse to be torn between supporting their parents or their partner. I go through this with my own wife; her parents are extremely overbearing in some ways (and we don't even have kids!!), and despite me having a dozen conversations with her about putting me in weird spots with her parents, it still happens. I've grown to understand that it is incredibly stressful to have my wife (of TEN years) have to choose between doing what makes me 100% happy and what makes her parents 100% happy. Instead, she \"tries\" to compromise, even if it means I have to accept a situation will not turn out the way I'd like it to. For example, her dad (my FIL) will \\*constantly\\* call/text her, and ask her to ask me, if he can borrow X expensive tool/equipment, or if I can do X favor for him, instead of just calling and asking ME. He knows I'll say no, so he tries to get my wife to butter me up and ask for him. Finally I just had to call him myself and tell him to stop making my wife the middle man in all of this shit. I told him I don't loan out expensive tools/equipment to ANYONE, and that it was nothing personal. He has gotten much better about doing that kind of thing ever since, and my wife no longer has to play the mediator in situations like that. This is a huge CONCEPT you need to realize, and not a situational thing. What I mean is, realize that your wife is having to be the middle-man (woman) in this sort of situation, and that can be incredibly tough and highly-stressful. You even said yourself that your wife \"finally caved\"...that sounds to me like she has been getting pestered by her mom/parents for a long time and has stood strong, but finally figured that just getting it done would be worth the relief she would get from her mom constantly asking. Let's all be real here--it IS just a little bit of water that your kid will never remember and that you know means jack shit to your or your wife. Who gives a fuck? YES it was a betrayal of trust, but it's not like your own wife proposed it and purposefully did it to hurt you or the kid. Honestly, calm down. You are creating more trouble that this entire situation would have, had you just agreed with your wife that it might be a small thing to make your MIL happy. Again, this assumes you have some semblance of a normal relationship with your crazy religious in-laws. If it's some toxic relationship with constant speed bumps and things of this nature ALL THE TIME, then maybe consider staying true to the \"not ever watching him again\" thing. But again, you're creating much more turbulence in this situation than your wife or MIL.\n\nThis is a marriage now, not your wife adopting all of your personal views, opinions and beliefs. Again, calm down and stop blowing this out of proportion. It was a dumb mistake, and one for which you should make MIL feel awful about DIRECTLY. Don't rely on your wife to team up on her with you. You need to take this up directly with your MIL and lay the law down. This is the perfect time to reset expectations with regards to how you and your wife want to handle the raising of your child.\n\nAnd you're talking about DIVORCE from all of this??? God damn, you're in for a difficult life if you immediately run to the extremes of the proverbial reaction scale from things like this. I get not being religious and the \"breach of trust\", but there simply must be other stuff going on and you're using this as the reason to consider divorce. You have more personal problems that need to be addressed, because your overreaction to all of this is astounding. And you are asking \\*THE INTERNET\\* about something as heavy as this, instead of having a real heavy discussion with your wife and her parents (and a counsellor). Incredible. Grow up.",

You even said yourself that your wife &quot;finally caved&quot;...that sounds to me like she has been getting pestered by her mom/parents for a long time and has stood strong, but finally figured that just getting it done would be worth the relief she would get from her mom constantly asking. Let&#39;s all be real here--it IS just a little bit of water that your kid will never remember and that you know means jack shit to your or your wife. Who gives a fuck? YES it was a betrayal of trust, but it&#39;s not like your own wife proposed it and purposefully did it to hurt you or the kid. Honestly, calm down. You are creating more trouble that this entire situation would have, had you just agreed with your wife that it might be a small thing to make your MIL happy. Again, this assumes you have some semblance of a normal relationship with your crazy religious in-laws. If it&#39;s some toxic relationship with constant speed bumps and things of this nature ALL THE TIME, then maybe consider staying true to the &quot;not ever watching him again&quot; thing. But again, you&#39;re creating much more turbulence in this situation than your wife or MIL.</p>\n\n<p>This is a marriage now, not your wife adopting all of your personal views, opinions and beliefs. Again, calm down and stop blowing this out of proportion. It was a dumb mistake, and one for which you should make MIL feel awful about DIRECTLY. Don&#39;t rely on your wife to team up on her with you. You need to take this up directly with your MIL and lay the law down. This is the perfect time to reset expectations with regards to how you and your wife want to handle the raising of your child.</p>\n\n<p>And you&#39;re talking about DIVORCE from all of this??? God damn, you&#39;re in for a difficult life if you immediately run to the extremes of the proverbial reaction scale from things like this. I get not being religious and the &quot;breach of trust&quot;, but there simply must be other stuff going on and you&#39;re using this as the reason to consider divorce. You have more personal problems that need to be addressed, because your overreaction to all of this is astounding. And you are asking *THE INTERNET* about something as heavy as this, instead of having a real heavy discussion with your wife and her parents (and a counsellor). Incredible. Grow up.</p>\n</div>",

I didn't dave our marriage but a lot of things got discussed that really needed to be discussed (resentment, thongs that he had done in the past while drunk etc) regardless of whether we stayed married or not. I also would require the wife to do individual counseling so she  sn grow a spine and move away from her mother's death grip of control. Marriage counseling won't be helpful for that because that is what she needs to work on by herself with a therapist. Unless she is willing to really do that (and once a month won't be enough probably) and really put an effort to cut the cord with her mom i would reconsider the marriage. Your wife has to change. I'm sorry she had a tough childhood but that doesn't make it ok to act like this for the rest of her life. She CAN do something to change herself and not let her mom have so much influence on her and be able to tell her mom no. But it will require willingness to change and it will take time. She broke your trust and that will take time to recover, so she will need to put in a lot of effort to fix her issues. Don't make any rash decisions but don't stay because you feel like you have to. But give yourself time to process this and calm down so yiu are not driven by emotions alone. And individual therapy for you would probably be helpful as well to help you through this.",

I get youre angry u/nobaptismahole , i would be too. What they did was a betrayal but in my opinion it isnt one that cant be fixed with some couples therapy and cutting out the MIL for the time being. Never make a life changing decision when youre angry. Religion makes people do stupid, selfish things. You have to understand that while its very against what you wanted (and what i would want too, so i get it), they werent coming from a place of malice and intent to harm. I do think this is being taken too far, you need to communicate because thats one of the most important things in a relationship. When you have a more level head, talk about how her actions hurt you and also listen to what she has to say, then decide from there. Dont let anger ruin something beautiful in your life because someone messed up (even big mistakes like this one, amends can be made). She also seems remorseful and willing to actively try to make this right, id say try to give her the chance. Just my 2 cents.",

This is an enormous violation and you should have somebody you can trust to give you input about whether to divorce or not. Ending the relationship now may or may not be rash, and a therapist can help you evaluate everything in context and help you decide how to move forward. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you and your son, but glad you put your foot down. If my dad had done that and not allowed me contact with his in-laws, I probably wouldn\u2019t have as many issues as I do now. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR? You\u2019re doing the right thing. Go to individual therapy. Best of luck to you.</p>\n</div>",

The difference is we were both will to talk and decide what we were comfortable with. For us, the baptism was about tradition and welcoming the kids into our family. It was another reason for celebration. </p>\n\n<p>But, if someone had done such a thing behind my back it would be unforgivable. Your wife has to understand that it is important to discuss these things, even if they are hard to discuss. It is a level of trust that may not be possible to regain. I am so sorry you are dealing with this.</p>\n</div>",

Normally, this is a bunch of nonsense, but in this case, it could help divorce proceedings. \n\nSecond, there is the \"right of first refusal\", making certain that two parents have to agree to visitation from third parties ... like inlaws, for example. \n\nThird, in most countries, making unlateral decisions about a child without the other parent's consent is seen as unfavourable, especially if the country is secular.

        "body": "It's incredibly possible OP's wife was emotionally abused growing up. I'm talking to a therapist right now, and I just realized not long ago my own mom might be a narcissist. She used to call every Sunday afternoon to ask if I'd been to church. For nearly a decade, the answer was almost always no.\n\nI finally stood up for myself and told her that I'm not going to church because I am not interested in attending church, and that I was going to leave it at that. She pried, and pried, and pried, but I still shut down any discussion because they don't need to know that I'm an atheist. They'd probably go ape shit if I ever told them.\n\nThat was the most emotionally challenging hill I have ever had to climb. My life has revolved for a long time around making my parents proud of me. And I'm starting to slowly realize there are more important things out there, and I will never be happy if I am constantly seeking their approval. My partner won't want to be with someone who, as a grown adult, places more loyalty to their parents than to them. I am working on undoing years of abuse they may or may not have been aware they were inflicting on me. I have never felt like I am enough to them. I have never felt like I live up to their standards, and it's caused me a great deal of depression. One example that always comes to mind is the fact that I was always an A/B student in college, and I constantly got lectured for grades.\n\nAnd maybe at this moment, that's where OP's wife stands. I'm not saying she's right or defending her. This behavior is outrageous and appalling and needs to be called out to keep it from repeating. I'm trying to point out that broken people do broken things. Deeply religious parents tend to be very controlling over their adult children. You don't ever feel a sense of independence, and that leads you to do some very questionable things for the sake of keeping them happy sometimes without realizing how much it can hurt others close to you.\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this, OP.",

Like who actually takes hivemind reddit advice this seriously?</p>\n</div>",

I can see how from her point of view it&#39;s just some water and words, it doesn&#39;t hurt anything, it doesn&#39;t change anything, and it would make the bullying stop. I&#39;d probably have tried to convince my husband to just go along with it to keep the peace, but going behind his back was shitty.</p>\n</div>",

Even if it was illicit (unlawful) if it was valid under our laws the sacrament happened and it can\u2019t be erased. There is a canonical concept of intent in the validity of a baptism but it is that the priest or minister of baptism intends to baptize under our understanding of baptism. It\u2019s not the intent of the parents or the individual being baptized. \n\nPeople often call asking for their names to be removed from the baptismal registers but we don\u2019t do that. Once you\u2019re baptized, the church considers you baptized forever. Confirmation is a separate sacrament, not a \u201cconfirming\u201d of baptism.",

I have no motivation to move upward in my career. I have no motivation to actually do my work. I just don't feel anything for it. \n\nI should have known that my real love is in working with computers. I've been tinkering with desktop and laptop computers since I was 14 years old. Instead of wasting all that time and money in college, I should have studied for IT certifications. Better late than never, I suppose. I still have probably 40 years of working life before I retire. I should be networking devices and maintaining systems, not crunching numbers in Excel. But at least the pay is decent.\n\nThe good thing that came out of studying accounting is that I can do my own taxes and I know how to calculate payments and amortize a loan. That's pretty nifty, I'd say.\n\nBut yeah, I'm right there with you, brother. Good luck on your journey. I, too, know it'll be long and difficult. I'm having to undo *years* of abuse. My biggest challenge is actually opening up to my therapist. I've kept so much inside for so long that I'm not entirely sure how to let it out.

Edit to add: I know some people that have \"un-baptised\" themselves, you need to fill some papers and contact the church where you were baptised, so it's possible to do it.

That being said, I\u2019d like to answer this response from the positions of both an academic & someone who was raised in & is very familiar with the Catholic Church. Everything I say is intended with the utmost respect, & I do not wish to \u201cfight\u201d with anyone nor do I care to hear things like \u201cYou\u2019re going to Hell.\u201d I find that things like this/conversations like this are best approached from an arm\u2019s length & the view of \u2018I\u2019d like to have an exchange of opinions within a respectful discussion from which we can both benefit & hopefully learn something.\u2019*}}\n\nThe rigidity of the \u201cblack & white NO GREY\u201d of Catholicism is a big part of why I find it very difficult to return to the Church. Like you, I had all the sacraments you \u201cshould have\u201d as you grow up + Catholic School, but I always asked *too many questions* & was reprimanded a lot by the nuns, a priest or two, & teachers. When I decided that I felt religious studies was such an important aspect of history & anthropology (my two majors at university) that it should be one of my undergrad minors, I asked a priest at my uni for a sit down. Now, it was a Jesuit university & the Jesuits are sometimes deemed too liberal by many followers (& even some of the hierarchy) of the Church. I actually think if more priests were like the Jesuits, the Church wouldn\u2019t lose so many followers. They tend to be much more open-minded, loyal to the actual teachings of Jesus not in just word but interpretive meaning, & A LOT less judgmental. Plus, their idea of education to create the \u201cRenaissance Man\u201d as the ideal goal (now regardless of gender) is I think one of the best ways to approach education. (Basically they want you to be so well-rounded & exposed to so much\u2014incl. other religions\u2014that you can be dropped in a room anywhere in the world & not just be an active participant in the conversation but also have enough understanding to be able to express sympathy & empathy for all of God\u2019s creations)\n\nSo, at the time, it was uni, I was living with my boyfriend of 2.5 years, we were doing all the things young couples do (at the time I thought we would marry, but it was actually a priest who helped me out of what became an incredibly abusive relationship), & I was a bit afraid to have an open, honest conversation with a priest. But I\u2019m stubborn & I felt it was significant, so I did. What he said to me, & what others like him have reiterated throughout my years in academia, will stick with me forever. He essentially said that many of his \u201cbrethren\u201d had perverted the messages of Jesus, following the examples set before them by countless cardinals, bishops, even popes over thousands of years, in order to exert control & dominance over Catholics. That parts of the Church had become as corrupted as society as a whole when it came to greed & capitalism (shocker, I know). And that now, as Catholics or even just good members of society, it was our place to question anything that we truly felt was *wrong*, regardless of what the teachings said. Then he proceeded to ask me a series of questions that forever changed not just how I look at religion but life as a whole. \n\nHe asked if I honestly thought that Jesus would have turned away anyone who was gay & (despite *the teachings*) continued to act on these feelings if they were doing so in love. \n\nHe asked if I thought any child deserved to suffer at the hands of anyone, be it their parents or God, in general let alone bc of original sin\u2014 which he believed was washed away when Jesus died for our sins (if you want to theologically contextualize it). \n\nHe asked if I thought that anyone who hasn\u2019t committed a mortal sin\u2014 taken a life, abused anyone in any way, basically any sin that hurts another being mentally/physically/emotionally\u2014couldn\u2019t be forgiven by God for their discretions outside of a confessional or even really deserved to be damned. (Is confession best? Absolutely, but in its absence, is being truly & wholly regretful & sorry not enough?) \n\nDid I believe anyone who died suddenly & who didn\u2019t have that chance for Last Rites & a last Confession were doomed to be damned?\n\nWhy can\u2019t we question or get angry at God... you don\u2019t think he gets angry at us? \n\nHis takeaway was this: It comes down to how we live our lives\u2014with pure love of every single inch of God\u2019s creation good bad & ugly\u2014& the intent behind everything we do. And if any of our good intentions fail, we must recognize our wrongdoing, rectify it, & make amends to whomever we have offended. If everything you\u2019ve done in life has been with & in love, & there have still been times you have failed in any way, you must be able to acknowledge that you have done so AND make amends in the best ways you know how so whomever you have hurt does not continue to suffer. In doing this, you will be seen by God exactly as you are: His own creation, made in love, flawed but capable of becoming so much more than just our flaws. \n\nI think that means that the afterlife isn\u2019t dictated so rigidly by the rules created by man (even if you believe the commandments came from God, you have to admit, there\u2019s no way to KNOW for certain they weren\u2019t altered, interpreted, or misrepresented in any way) but by our hearts & our actions. If we are able to live positively, help others, & make sure that everything we do is in love (to the best of our abilities), we are living a Godly life that deserves to be recognized in the afterlife. So, according to the Jesuits, few regular ol\u2019 priests, & numerous biblical scholars & theologians, I think you\u2019ll be ok. Now, where Fr. McLeary who thinks Mass should still be in Latin, women should be controlled by men, birth control is a sin, \u201cliving in sin\u201d is still a thing, & so on stands on the issue, I\u2019m not so sure. But I don\u2019t believe that the \u201cFr. McLearys\u201d of the world dictate what happens beyond this veil.\n\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fTo add\u2014 I feel like it\u2019s probably pretty important to say that while I was raised Catholic & have a pretty extensive, mostly Jesuit education, I have been exposed to nearly every single civilization, types of peoples, rituals, ceremonies, practices & so on from further back than Sumer all the way through the Harappans, Egyptians, Greeks, Mayans, Aztecs, Indigenous Peoples/ Native Americans, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve also read (either by choice or by educational \u201cpush\u201d we\u2019ll call it ha) almost every religious text, including but not limited to: the Talmud & Torah, the Bible (King James & others + \u201cBiblical texts\u201d accepted by the Church but not necessarily taught or factored into the Bible), the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas, the writings of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, the Upanishads, the Sutras, the Avesta/Zend-Avesta, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, & more myths than any person ever should or I could ever name lol. \n\nSo while this conversation with my favorite Jesuit priest & all the ones that followed that all held the same core teachings incredibly affected the way I see life, the afterlife, the universe, & God (or the concept of God), my thoughts, feelings, opinions, & conclusions have undoubtedly been\u2014either consciously or subconsciously\u2014greatly affected by my exposure to these texts & the VERY wide array of peoples & cultures I\u2019ve studied. \n\nI\u2019m very grateful to have done so, but if you\u2019re looking for someone who is solely focused on biblical text, Catholicism, or even Christianity, I\u2019m not your girl & take everything I say with a grain of salt!",

And if any of our good intentions fail, we must recognize our wrongdoing, rectify it, &amp; make amends to whomever we have offended. If everything you\u2019ve done in life has been with &amp; in love, &amp; there have still been times you have failed in any way, you must be able to acknowledge that you have done so AND make amends in the best ways you know how so whomever you have hurt does not continue to suffer. In doing this, you will be seen by God exactly as you are: His own creation, made in love, flawed but capable of becoming so much more than just our flaws. </p>\n\n<p>I think that means that the afterlife isn\u2019t dictated so rigidly by the rules created by man (even if you believe the commandments came from God, you have to admit, there\u2019s no way to KNOW for certain they weren\u2019t altered, interpreted, or misrepresented in any way) but by our hearts &amp; our actions. If we are able to live positively, help others, &amp; make sure that everything we do is in love (to the best of our abilities), we are living a Godly life that deserves to be recognized in the afterlife. So, according to the Jesuits, few regular ol\u2019 priests, &amp; numerous biblical scholars &amp; theologians, I think you\u2019ll be ok. Now, where Fr. McLeary who thinks Mass should still be in Latin, women should be controlled by men, birth control is a sin, \u201cliving in sin\u201d is still a thing, &amp; so on stands on the issue, I\u2019m not so sure. But I don\u2019t believe that the \u201cFr. McLearys\u201d of the world dictate what happens beyond this veil.</p>\n\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0fTo add\u2014 I feel like it\u2019s probably pretty important to say that while I was raised Catholic &amp; have a pretty extensive, mostly Jesuit education, I have been exposed to nearly every single civilization, types of peoples, rituals, ceremonies, practices &amp; so on from further back than Sumer all the way through the Harappans, Egyptians, Greeks, Mayans, Aztecs, Indigenous Peoples/ Native Americans, etc. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve also read (either by choice or by educational \u201cpush\u201d we\u2019ll call it ha) almost every religious text, including but not limited to: the Talmud &amp; Torah, the Bible (King James &amp; others + \u201cBiblical texts\u201d accepted by the Church but not necessarily taught or factored into the Bible), the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas, the writings of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, the Upanishads, the Sutras, the Avesta/Zend-Avesta, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, &amp; more myths than any person ever should or I could ever name lol. </p>\n\n<p>So while this conversation with my favorite Jesuit priest &amp; all the ones that followed that all held the same core teachings incredibly affected the way I see life, the afterlife, the universe, &amp; God (or the concept of God), my thoughts, feelings, opinions, &amp; conclusions have undoubtedly been\u2014either consciously or subconsciously\u2014greatly affected by my exposure to these texts &amp; the VERY wide array of peoples &amp; cultures I\u2019ve studied. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m very grateful to have done so, but if you\u2019re looking for someone who is solely focused on biblical text, Catholicism, or even Christianity, I\u2019m not your girl &amp; take everything I say with a grain of salt!</p>\n</div>",
