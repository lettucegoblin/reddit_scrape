When I spoke with my mother as an adult (and as someone who had dabbled in bdsm and so had done my research) about it, she tried to pull the same shit. So I told her \"by forcing me to be around and interact with your \"partners\" you were forcing me to be involved in your kink. If you had kept it out of the house that would've been one thing (which is apparently what they did for years until we moved into a bigger house and they thought they could get away with it), but you forced me and my brothers, all children, to 'accept' your guys kinks and interact with your fuck buddies like they belonged in the family. You openly showed us that your kinks and your wanting to get off mattered more than your kids well being.\"\n\nYeah, she wasnt pleased about that, but I didnt care. There were other things that happened (leaving their sex toys out where we could find them, calling one of their friends 'daddy' in front of my youngest sibling and confusing the fuck out of them, my mom bragging about being the high school bicycle to my future in laws, etc) that led to all of this. And I'm no kink shamer, i wont yuck someone else's yum as long as everything is consensual. But bringing your sexual partners who you are not in a relationship with around your kids is not okay. My hubs and I are pretty kinky ourselves, but our daughter will never know about it because we keep everything hidden.\n\nYou are NTA, your parents cared more about their sexual gratification than their child's mental and emotional well being, that much is obvious. And your reaction was absolutely just; dont let them beat this down or gaslight you. You were forced to interact with people who only existed in your lives for your parents to fuck, and if that isnt borderline grooming I dont know what is. How well did they actually know these people? Did they know their backgrounds, did they vet these people to make sure they werent, ya know, interested in more than just adults and polyamory. Your parents put you in a SERIOUSLY dangerous situation.",

The assumed you were fine. \n\n It is a parents job and pleasure to have   routine  conversations with children to discuss feelings  and  be emotionally close with their child.   Parents help children learn to express their feelings.  They teach emotional vocabulary . A child needs to be in touch with their own feelings and be able to talk about emotions. Parents are supposed to teach them. \n\n In addition parents teach spiritual matters and  give children a foundation.in thinking about right and wrong. \n\nYour parents neglected and abused you in these two areas . They put you in danger physically by leaving you alone with strangers and they put you at emotional risk too.  In the future you might choose friends and romantic partners who put their interests first and neglect you.  You might choose people like that  not because that is what  is best for you, but because it is what feels familiar like the way you grew up. I would like to suggest a group where you might feel support and help :  Adult Children of Alcoholics and Disfunctional families. I know your parents are not alcoholic.  But it sounds like  they may have had an addiction to multiple sex partners like an alcoholic has an addiction to alcohol.  And the addiction is  the focus of their life even above their children. The adult children of addicts might face similar problems. I am so sorry that your childhood was unsafe and your parents did not cherish you as you deserved.   You had needs that went unmet. As an adult you can seek counseling, support group and your own personal study to heal those broken parts.",

Parents help children learn to express their feelings.  They teach emotional vocabulary . A child needs to be in touch with their own feelings and be able to talk about emotions. Parents are supposed to teach them. </p>\n\n<p>In addition parents teach spiritual matters and  give children a foundation.in thinking about right and wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Your parents neglected and abused you in these two areas .

The truth is polyamory increases this likelihood by tenfold.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n'Children living with their mother and her boyfriend are about 11 times more likely to be sexually, physically, or emotionally abused than children living with their married biological parents. Likewise, children living with their mother and her boyfriend are six times more likely to be physically, emotionally, or educationally neglected than children living with their married biological parents.'\n\nThe neglect comes from the fact that exposing a vulnerable child to an unrelated adult is the most likely scenario when that child is going to encounter abuse. This is likely to happen from just one adult alone, but in polyamory the child is trusted with several strangers who are not related to the child. This opens up so many avenues for abuse, trafficking and many other problems, including full grown adults who will compete with a child for their parents' affection and care very little for the child's wellbeing.

She was one of those moms who had very little involvement in her kids lives, so any attention her kids got made them overjoyed.  It turned out that she was using us to play some sort of weird, sleazy flirting game with this guy...I mean, looking back, I would like to scream at her for acting that way, for exposing all of us to that, and especially for neglecting her own kids.</p>\n\n<p>Now when people claim to be in these non-traditional, oversexed relationships, I am immediately disgusted.  I&#39;ve seen the collateral damage done to the kids. </p>\n\n<p>No kid needs to wonder who the man with mommy is. or where mommy is for the weekend.</p>\n</div>",

The behaviour you describe, including how they reacted to your disclosure, makes me suspect that they are on the damaged end of the spectrum, which doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you, but may mean that they are very self-involved and don\u2019t have the capacity to self-reflect and take responsibility and act in actual loving ways. You certainly don\u2019t owe them anything - even calmness. It is entirely understandable and rational if you are feeling the need to take some time and space from them. You know your parents best and so I suspect in your gut you know if your fathers offer to discuss it further is genuine or manipulative. If you want to continue to have a relationship with them at some point I would encourage you to tell them that any discussion needs to occur on your timeline and with your boundaries in place. In other words they need to consider your needs. This may be difficult for them as they don\u2019t seem to have a history of considering your needs - or feelings.

The documentary producer they interviewed on Tiger King was aiming to make a shock-umentary before all his footage got burned, you can tell based on how he talked about Joe Exotic: \u201che was crazy, but if I humored him while filming, I\u2019d have a great show so we could all laugh at him!\u201d</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for articulating what I was trying to get at !! The whole post at face value is how OP has had to tell their parents something they DID not know or realise. They wanted to go on a DOCUMENTARY because they saw themselves as a GOOD EXAMPLE of being poly parents so everyone else rushing to comment \u201cIM POLY WITH A KID OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS AND WE ARE GOOD\u201d is so tone deaf considering that\u2019s EXACTLY how OP\u2019s parents must have felt. I know it\u2019s not nice to have your worldview challenged but I wish people would be a little less tunnel vision and accept that yeah maybe kids wouldn\u2019t be okay with it. And OP is a good example why.</p>\n</div>",

It also sounds like OP potentially knew more about their parents&#39; sex lives than they probably should have and/wanted to know, which can often go along with treating kids as little adults, as opposed to just letting them be kids. Again, it&#39;s not about the &quot;polyamory&quot;- it&#39;s about the parents being selfish. No matter what they call the arrangement it comes down to them putting their sex/dating lives above their child.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously NTA, OP. Your parents have a lot they need to reflect on right now... hopefully if/when they do they&#39;ll realize how inappropriately they treated you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow, thanks so much for the gold!</p>\n</div>",
