How else are we supposed to gamble on who dies first? You know if you presume that you won&#39;t die, the (insert monster sounding name here) will come to get you?&quot; But I&#39;m also not someone who experiences racism, just a lot of other discrimination that causes me to sometimes do stuff like this to get people to shut the hell up and realize how offensive they sound. </p>\n\n<p>Just like, go full fucking tilt. I&#39;m a witch, and I get some really annoying presumptions and shit like that (especially being pagan) so it gets on my nerves quite a bit.</p>\n</div>",
