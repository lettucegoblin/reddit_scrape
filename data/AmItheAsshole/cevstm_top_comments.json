Yes, you are a capitalist because we live in a capitalist society and it's either get income on the house or it goes bye-bye. Also, even if we lived in a socialist society, you'd still have to pay a shitload of taxes on it (in fact, your tax burden would be higher). \n\nIt is not your job to validate your sister's poor financial sense. Maybe you could give her a \"family discount\" when she wants to stay, or offer a barter system where she does upkeep on the house (some cleaning, maybe repaint job, updating appliances, redecoration), which would save you money and probably make her feel like she has some control of the house. But at the end of the day, it's your house, and you're making a smart move by using it to generate income. \n\nAs for the neighborhood issue, I think it's easy enough to screen Airbnb guests and put up rules about noise, parties, et cetera. You might get some dickheads, but I think the \"guest was perfectly fine, cleaned up after themselves, didn't act like a prick to the neighbors, stripped the bed when they left\" stories aren't as juicy as \"Airbnb guests destroy neighborhood and ruin entire city\".",

Yes, you are a capitalist because we live in a capitalist society and it&#39;s either get income on the house or it goes bye-bye. Also, even if we lived in a socialist society, you&#39;d still have to pay a shitload of taxes on it (in fact, your tax burden would be higher). </p>\n\n<p>It is not your job to validate your sister&#39;s poor financial sense. Maybe you could give her a &quot;family discount&quot; when she wants to stay, or offer a barter system where she does upkeep on the house (some cleaning, maybe repaint job, updating appliances, redecoration), which would save you money and probably make her feel like she has some control of the house. But at the end of the day, it&#39;s your house, and you&#39;re making a smart move by using it to generate income. </p>\n\n<p>As for the neighborhood issue, I think it&#39;s easy enough to screen Airbnb guests and put up rules about noise, parties, et cetera. You might get some dickheads, but I think the &quot;guest was perfectly fine, cleaned up after themselves, didn&#39;t act like a prick to the neighbors, stripped the bed when they left&quot; stories aren&#39;t as juicy as &quot;Airbnb guests destroy neighborhood and ruin entire city&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

You&#39;re trusting strangers with your home right? Might as well be safe than sorry. Because sometimes? People are shitty, which I assume you know.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: forgot to add. Ask your agent if they can get some &quot;Do Not Duplicate&quot; keys. They aren&#39;t legally binding exactly, unless you make them, but a lot of key copying places won&#39;t cut a new key for you if it says that. Your sister is...(how to not be harsh?) a little out there. </p>\n\n<p>Talk to your agent, see what they say about security ideas, and go from there.</p>\n</div>",
