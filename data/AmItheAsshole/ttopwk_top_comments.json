As someone who's gone through similar, I can say it's probably not going to get better and he's going to continue to act like a brat to get what he wants, which is not a cute look for a grown man.

He sounds controlling, and you dropped red flags everywhere.\n\nMore specifically, there are three big ones.\n\n>\"I have to join or you'll have to cancel\"\n\nOof... Two sentences in and I've already seen a massive red fucking banner. He basically banned you from hanging with your friends without him present? He demanded you to cancel your plans if it doesn't include him? Most importantly, why does he have so much control over what you do and don't do? This is so toxic.\n\nUltimatums are toxic in general. His is even more so - you can only choose between having him in your gatherings or having all your plans cancelled. Which is basically, you do what he wants or you do what he wants. How controlling is that?\n\nAside from him trying to control you - this comment raises another red flag. Does he try to accompany you everywhere when you go on your own, and if it happens, is it worse when you're with friends and family? Isolating their partner from their friends and family - their support system - is a pretty common abuse tactic. Abusers will do everything to keep their victim from being with their loved ones, as it makes the victim dependent on them and takes away the support they would've gotten if they tried to leave.\n\n>The girls came and my boyfriend immediately sat with us and started ruining our conversations by steering them towards him/his work/his achievement.\n\nYeah, I can see why you and your friends don't want him around. Obviously it's a girls' night, but his behavior would make me embarrassed to bring him *anywhere*.  The night is for you to spend with your girlfriends - him ruining your conversations just to make them about HIM and HIS ACHIEVEMENTS is seriously concerning.\n\nPlease remember that he doesn't get to control you meeting your friends, especially not because 'it's his place'. It's your place now that you moved it with him. The fact that a) he's telling you who you get to be friends with, and b) he's acting like 'allowing' your friends over is a favor he's giving you, is just \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nIt seems like he doesn't care about your or your friends' feelings and comfort. Like, did your friends visit you to listen to all of Great Boyfriend's achievements?\n\n>he came home and berated me saying I made him feel uncomfortable/sick with the horrible subjects I kept bringing.\n\nINFO: Are you sure he's a 27 year old man with a girlfriend?\n\n*The things that you talked about are all normal bodily functions that happen to millions - no, billions - of women.* Him shaming you for talking about day-to-day things with your friends is bad enough, but this?
