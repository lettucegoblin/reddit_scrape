When my daughter was little she watched it a lot, and I LOVED it because somehow that loving family dynamic was really soothing. As sad as it is to say, sometimes I'd put Dinosaur Train on my phone and use headphones to listen to it while trying to fall asleep because it just felt very cozy and comforting.\n\nSo -- I'm glad to learn there's another human being who recognizes what a good family we see on Dinosaur Train. :p\n\nI'm so happy you moved out. And I'm so happy you're finally able to witness a healthy, loving family dynamic. I'm also thrilled that your sister is being a great mom rather than following in the footsteps of your parents.",

Mine wouldn't even admit that the process was possible until I quoted federal websites at them. Then they handed me the required paperwork and kicked me out of their office. I was repeatedly told that it was better for me to \"just ask [my] mommy and daddy for more money or a parent plus loan.\" I had been supporting myself for 3 years before I even started school and I could barely get information to file each year. All I ever did get from them was a copy of their tax return and I had to work out for myself how to fill in the data. I didn't get to file as an independent until I aged out of the requirement. \n\nThe biggest issue I ran into was that I didn't have any documentation or anyone to write necessary letters for me. The school counselors weren't helpful, just kept telling me that \"parents love their children\" and that I would be fine. My \"parents\" made me feel like I wasn't able to tell anyone about my situation. They didn't take me to a therapist, because they were abusive and neglectful. So I had no one to support my case. I bet that's an issue for most kids who need the override; abusive and neglectful parents don't get their kids help. It's cruel the way FAFSA makes abused people depend on their abusers to get Financial Aid information. It's a horrible experience to be forced to stay in an abusive situation when you know you need to escape. \n\nStupidly, a friend of mine got in a tiff with his parents who threatened to stop paying his tuition and allowance. They didn't like his low grades, and he didn't like being told to focus less on his social life. He, a young black man, walked into financial aid and was immediate helped to begin the process. His parents never actually stopped paying for anything.\n\nMy schools financial aid office was only interested in getting help to the \"right\" students.",

I didn&#39;t get to file as an independent until I aged out of the requirement. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue I ran into was that I didn&#39;t have any documentation or anyone to write necessary letters for me. The school counselors weren&#39;t helpful, just kept telling me that &quot;parents love their children&quot; and that I would be fine. My &quot;parents&quot; made me feel like I wasn&#39;t able to tell anyone about my situation. They didn&#39;t take me to a therapist, because they were abusive and neglectful. So I had no one to support my case. I bet that&#39;s an issue for most kids who need the override; abusive and neglectful parents don&#39;t get their kids help. It&#39;s cruel the way FAFSA makes abused people depend on their abusers to get Financial Aid information. It&#39;s a horrible experience to be forced to stay in an abusive situation when you know you need to escape. </p>\n\n<p>Stupidly, a friend of mine got in a tiff with his parents who threatened to stop paying his tuition and allowance. They didn&#39;t like his low grades, and he didn&#39;t like being told to focus less on his social life. He, a young black man, walked into financial aid and was immediate helped to begin the process. His parents never actually stopped paying for anything.</p>\n\n<p>My schools financial aid office was only interested in getting help to the &quot;right&quot; students.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "!) I had a great mom, and a dad that has some issues but still a pretty great dad.  But I have also worked in foster care system as a volunteer for 20+ yr...I get exactly what you are saying.  My issues are with my brother- he was physically and emotionally abusive, and we just have a terrible relationship- and it is all on his end- he decided  I was too weird and cut me out of his life to a great degree.  I spent decades trying to be acceptable to him and be who I am.  \n2) I am well into middle age- and I certainly did not get here at 22!  Or 32...and I am still a work in process.  Everyone has their own journey, and you don't have to even WANT to value compassion- I discovered Buddhism and yoga many years ago, and I decided I valued that.  And if I valued it, I would work on being better on it.  But one thing that was very hard was compassion for my brother, without feeling like his abuse is then being condones/somehow saying that is acceptable.  \n3) so being given the insight that accepting others are doing the best they can (if that is a value you choose to internalize), that does not mean that you have to accept or condone the actions that are harmful to you or others.  In fact you do not.  And should not.  \n4) As adults, we make our own choices- our childhood trauma (and while mine is not like yours- I had good parents, but as with all parents, flawed), can inform how we seek to grow? But you are under no obligation to grow, adapt, or change.  And if you choose to do so, you are under no obligation to the parents or others that harmed you. Especially if that harm is on going.  I am only speaking to my experience.  Because I found that separation of compassion vs condoning harmful actions helpful to be told. \n\nAnd might I add- Family is not owed our presence.  Blood does not give them a pass for abuse.  You are 22- I don't know if you live with them , or rely on them for financial- but if you do not live with them or otherwise need their support on any plane? It can be healing to put distance from them for a while.  It helped me with certain abusive family members over the years.  My mom hated when I woudl refuse to see certain people.  But it helped me get to a place where I could be healthy and happy, and that makes that compassions if you to choose to practice it more accessible? Sorry your experience has sucked.   You do what you need to to take care of you- you owe NO ONE, certainly not me or the internet, or your parents, anything.  You take care of you.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>!) I had a great mom, and a dad that has some issues but still a pretty great dad.  But I have also worked in foster care system as a volunteer for 20+ yr...I get exactly what you are saying.  My issues are with my brother- he was physically and emotionally abusive, and we just have a terrible relationship- and it is all on his end- he decided  I was too weird and cut me out of his life to a great degree.  I spent decades trying to be acceptable to him and be who I am.<br/>\n2) I am well into middle age- and I certainly did not get here at 22!  Or 32...and I am still a work in process.  Everyone has their own journey, and you don&#39;t have to even WANT to value compassion- I discovered Buddhism and yoga many years ago, and I decided I valued that.  And if I valued it, I would work on being better on it.  But one thing that was very hard was compassion for my brother, without feeling like his abuse is then being condones/somehow saying that is acceptable.<br/>\n3) so being given the insight that accepting others are doing the best they can (if that is a value you choose to internalize), that does not mean that you have to accept or condone the actions that are harmful to you or others.  In fact you do not.  And should not.<br/>\n4) As adults, we make our own choices- our childhood trauma (and while mine is not like yours- I had good parents, but as with all parents, flawed), can inform how we seek to grow? But you are under no obligation to grow, adapt, or change.  And if you choose to do so, you are under no obligation to the parents or others that harmed you. Especially if that harm is on going.  I am only speaking to my experience.  Because I found that separation of compassion vs condoning harmful actions helpful to be told. </p>\n\n<p>And might I add- Family is not owed our presence.  Blood does not give them a pass for abuse.  You are 22- I don&#39;t know if you live with them , or rely on them for financial- but if you do not live with them or otherwise need their support on any plane? It can be healing to put distance from them for a while.  It helped me with certain abusive family members over the years.  My mom hated when I woudl refuse to see certain people.  But it helped me get to a place where I could be healthy and happy, and that makes that compassions if you to choose to practice it more accessible? Sorry your experience has sucked.
