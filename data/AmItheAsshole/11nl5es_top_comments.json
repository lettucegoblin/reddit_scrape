He is going to start that by making her apologize to the little boy because she hurt his feelings..it's the beginning if a slippery slope. He does realize that she's 7, right. Raising girls is not for the feint of heart\u2026I raised 2 but I taught them to stand up for themselves, not take any abuse from boys/men. To never backdown to a bully, etc. If I was you I'd look up articles on line about how to raise girls in todays environment..how to teach about recognizing abusive behaviours in relationships, etc and about the conditioning of young girls. There are so many out there. Ask him to read them. She's only 7 but the earlier he gets it, the better his parenting will be.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow\u2026is your hubby also 7? His attitude is how girls grow up and stay with abusive partners. They stay because they are conditioned to remain &quot;faithful&quot;. He is going to start that by making her apologize to the little boy because she hurt his feelings..it&#39;s the beginning if a slippery slope. He does realize that she&#39;s 7, right. Raising girls is not for the feint of heart\u2026I raised 2 but I taught them to stand up for themselves, not take any abuse from boys/men.
