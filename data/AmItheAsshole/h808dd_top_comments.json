I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:\n\n* Dairy\n\n* Wheat/Flour/Gluten\n\n* Legumes\n\nSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. \n\nI never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.\n\nI noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.\n\nIt didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.\n\nI was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. \n\nShe has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got \"carb addicted.\" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "This absolutely infuriates me! SO not NTA!\n\nThis will sound like I'm making this about my family but it's to sympathize with you.\n\nMy husband has a mild gluten intolerance (I'm not actually sure what to call it but it's not life threatening). But growing up his parents treated it like it was. And I'm sure it was helpful for him to avoid gluten. But he had all sorts of feelings of being left out and eating gluten free substitutes tasted awful. (I've heard gluten free substitutes have made headway in actually tasting good in the past couple decades or so). It got to the point when he made the decision as a teenager to start eating gluten, who cares about the consequences, because he was tired of being excluded from food despite family's best efforts. \n\nAnd his is a case where it is real. I can't imagine you having to be excluded from the group meals or desserts at parties, school events, random occasions, etc, only for it all to be fake! Not to mention that the people who love you also being fooled sent out of their way to accommodate a fantasy. \n\nHere's among the worst possible outcomes of your mom's falsehood. This could taint the reality of those who actually have food allergies for others. Hopefully anybody that accommodated your \"needs\" doesn't believe that all food allergies are fake or become suspicious of anybody with legitimate food allergies. Your mother may not have considered that she contributed to this mistrust of people's allergy or dietary needs because \"here's one more person that lied about it.

SO not NTA!</p>\n\n<p>This will sound like I&#39;m making this about my family but it&#39;s to sympathize with you.</p>\n\n<p>My husband has a mild gluten intolerance (I&#39;m not actually sure what to call it but it&#39;s not life threatening). But growing up his parents treated it like it was. And I&#39;m sure it was helpful for him to avoid gluten. But he had all sorts of feelings of being left out and eating gluten free substitutes tasted awful. (I&#39;ve heard gluten free substitutes have made headway in actually tasting good in the past couple decades or so). It got to the point when he made the decision as a teenager to start eating gluten, who cares about the consequences, because he was tired of being excluded from food despite family&#39;s best efforts. </p>\n\n<p>And his is a case where it is real. I can&#39;t imagine you having to be excluded from the group meals or desserts at parties, school events, random occasions, etc, only for it all to be fake! Not to mention that the people who love you also being fooled sent out of their way to accommodate a fantasy. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s among the worst possible outcomes of your mom&#39;s falsehood. This could taint the reality of those who actually have food allergies for others. Hopefully anybody that accommodated your &quot;needs&quot; doesn&#39;t believe that all food allergies are fake or become suspicious of anybody with legitimate food allergies. Your mother may not have considered that she contributed to this mistrust of people&#39;s allergy or dietary needs because &quot;here&#39;s one more person that lied about it. Therefore most other people are lying too.&quot; This is where stories of friends/family/others tampering with someone&#39;s food by putting a dangerous ingredient then sporting the surprised Pikachu face when they go into anaphylaxtic shock come from. &quot;Oh you&#39;re lying!&quot; &quot;Your allergy can&#39;t he THAT bad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sheesh.</p>\n</div>",

If you were raised not to eat certain foods, for whatever her true reasons were you would've stuck to that diet throughout childhood. In fact had she done that you may never have changed diet. But by lying? How do you trust a liar? Now when you think of all the normal childhood food related things where you were different,  you couldn't have that, you're going to associate it with because she lied saying I was allergic, not to whatever reasons your mum gives now. Whereas people raised to be vegetarian,  not eat certain meets, only eat halal meat & such don't have that negativity attached. You don't miss what you never had, unless your lied to about an allergy. \n\n\nI have 2 boys 13 & 11 my husband & I have never lied to them, we may explain things in simple terms, but let them know if they have questions we will do our best to answer them. If we don't know we'll find someone who does. They haven't asked any difficult questions, because they just accept things. Like my SIL & her female partner get auntie & auntie Christmas cards, they love each other the way daddy & I do hasn't had to be said. My two female friends have a daughter,  no questions, a friend who used to be called another name is actually a girl, was all the explaining that took. What they have questioned is why adults didn't want their children to be friends with her anymore & said nasty things. Why some boy said my son was gay when he isn't & thought being gay was a bad thing. Explaining bigotry isn't a conversation that should be needed, it shouldn't be a thing. But \"I lied to you & everyone else about your health for almost 2 decades, because I wanted to force you to make the diet choice I wanted you to make.\" That is absolutely not a conversation that should ever be needed.\n\nWhat if you had been with someone who actually had a serious allergy, that somehow triggered an allergic reaction? You could've used your \"EpiPen\" & unknowingly put that person in danger. Or if you had actually had an allergy, say to bees as that can be serious enough to require an EpiPen. Well you have an \"EpiPen\" with you but who knows what it is, or how that would interact with treatment. That's a dangerous lie. \n\nI'm sorry your mum betrayed you like that.\n\nEDIT: Just realised you said parents,  so the same goes for your dad if he knew it was a lie. If he only just found out & is fine with it, again same goes for him.",

        "body": "NTA. And just to make this perfectly clear here, I am playing devils advocate here. I largely agree with pretty much all the the top NTA posts at the time of me writing this. Lying to you was wrong. Making you live with the belief that you could suddenly die if you ate the wrong thing was wrong. You have every right to be angry and upset. With all that being said...\n\n\u2014-\n\nWe live in a society that is plagued with sickness and disease. There is significant evidence that the overwhelming majority of medical problems in the modern world are caused either directly or indirectly by our diet. More specifically, by a diet containing the foods that your mother told you you were allergic to.\n\nIf you continued to live your life without consuming those foods (that you thought you were allergic to) there is a high probability that you would have avoided all of those medical problems. You likely never would have had any kind of heart disease. Likely never would suffer from diabetes. Much less likely to develop cancer then the general population. (To be clear here, I mean this in a true statistical sense. Obviously there is still a chance any of these things could have happened. But that chance would have been much lower)\n\nIf you continued to live your life without consuming those foods, there is a decent probability you could have lived to approach the rough maximum human lifespan (115-125 years*). With all the advances made in modern medicine and tech, diet is really the only reason that people don\u2019t regularly live to be over 100. But perhaps more importantly, you would have dramatically increased your health span. Many people live into their 70s today. But most of the time their health is pretty much shot by the time they are 40. From there on (and honest, often sooner...) they live on various different pharmaceuticals with a generally limited quality of like. By the time they reach retirement age, they are frail and weak. Back problems, knee pain, overweight, diabetes. Various side effects of all the drugs they are taking. Then they die. \n\nImagine feeling like you do now for the next 100 years? I mean yes, you may have to slow down a bit once you hit your 90s or so, but many people who live in societies where living to be over 100 is normal are often more capable at 100 then the average 20 year old in modern western society**. \n\nNow that you know you aren\u2019t allergic to those foods, all the potential benefits above are lost to you. Unfortunately, you are human. The likelihood of you actually resisting the temptation of eating those foods without the fear of allergic reaction and possible death looming over your shoulder is so small it\u2019s not really worth considering. You will try bread now (you already have I believe from one of your comments.) You will try cheese. And Ice Cream. And pizza, and all the other foods that you\u2019ve avoided. And your going to discover that many of them are quite delicious. Maybe you\u2019ll try to stick to your healthy diet, but you will fail. You\u2019ll make exceptions for special occasions. Then you\u2019ll decide it\u2019s really fine as long as it\u2019s in moderation. And after a while you will most likely eat roughly the same as anybody else. Then again, you may not even try. You may say screw this, I\u2019m eating what I want from now on. To be clear, this is nothing personal. Just an observation on human behavior. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you will be the statistical outlier with such a high degree of discipline and willpower that you will stick to a perfect diet for the next 100 years, given the choice. \n\n\u2014-\n\nIf your mother hadn\u2019t lied to you, then you never would have stuck to the diet to begin with. You would have eaten the typical foods at friends homes. Or at the lunch table at school. Your aunt would have made you brownies (and snuck them to you when mom wasn\u2019t looking).

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. And just to make this perfectly clear here, I am playing devils advocate here. I largely agree with pretty much all the the top NTA posts at the time of me writing this. Lying to you was wrong. Making you live with the belief that you could suddenly die if you ate the wrong thing was wrong. You have every right to be angry and upset. With all that being said...</p>\n\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n\n<p>We live in a society that is plagued with sickness and disease. There is significant evidence that the overwhelming majority of medical problems in the modern world are caused either directly or indirectly by our diet. More specifically, by a diet containing the foods that your mother told you you were allergic to.</p>\n\n<p>If you continued to live your life without consuming those foods (that you thought you were allergic to) there is a high probability that you would have avoided all of those medical problems. You likely never would have had any kind of heart disease. Likely never would suffer from diabetes. Much less likely to develop cancer then the general population. (To be clear here, I mean this in a true statistical sense. Obviously there is still a chance any of these things could have happened. But that chance would have been much lower)</p>\n\n<p>If you continued to live your life without consuming those foods, there is a decent probability you could have lived to approach the rough maximum human lifespan (115-125 years*). With all the advances made in modern medicine and tech, diet is really the only reason that people don\u2019t regularly live to be over 100. But perhaps more importantly, you would have dramatically increased your health span. Many people live into their 70s today. But most of the time their health is pretty much shot by the time they are 40. From there on (and honest, often sooner...) they live on various different pharmaceuticals with a generally limited quality of like. By the time they reach retirement age, they are frail and weak. Back problems, knee pain, overweight, diabetes. Various side effects of all the drugs they are taking. Then they die. </p>\n\n<p>Imagine feeling like you do now for the next 100 years? I mean yes, you may have to slow down a bit once you hit your 90s or so, but many people who live in societies where living to be over 100 is normal are often more capable at 100 then the average 20 year old in modern western society**. </p>\n\n<p>Now that you know you aren\u2019t allergic to those foods, all the potential benefits above are lost to you. Unfortunately, you are human. The likelihood of you actually resisting the temptation of eating those foods without the fear of allergic reaction and possible death looming over your shoulder is so small it\u2019s not really worth considering. You will try bread now (you already have I believe from one of your comments.) You will try cheese. And Ice Cream. And pizza, and all the other foods that you\u2019ve avoided. And your going to discover that many of them are quite delicious. Maybe you\u2019ll try to stick to your healthy diet, but you will fail. You\u2019ll make exceptions for special occasions. Then you\u2019ll decide it\u2019s really fine as long as it\u2019s in moderation. And after a while you will most likely eat roughly the same as anybody else. Then again, you may not even try. You may say screw this, I\u2019m eating what I want from now on. To be clear, this is nothing personal. Just an observation on human behavior. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you will be the statistical outlier with such a high degree of discipline and willpower that you will stick to a perfect diet for the next 100 years, given the choice. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n\n<p>If your mother hadn\u2019t lied to you, then you never would have stuck to the diet to begin with. You would have eaten the typical foods at friends homes. Or at the lunch table at school. Your aunt would have made you brownies (and snuck them to you when mom wasn\u2019t looking). Grandpa would have taken you for ice cream. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of people are likely going to attack this comment, or pick apart various points / details.

        "body": "Abusers don't require mental illness to be abusive. Assholes are just assholes, selfishness and \"sin\"  aren't limited to some fictional section of the population that's \"unnaturally depraved\". Mental illness doesn't make you an asshole, your moral values are what makes you an asshole. People who steal and get involved in gangs are no more mentally ill than abusers. They made a choice to do what they did. You can tell because they lie about it and hide it, because they know it's wrong, just like toddlers know it's wrong to eat the cake they were told not to eat before dinner. Abuse isn't due to mental illness any more than that toddler's mistake is. \n\nAbuse is a choice to treat other people badly. Because they don't do it to just anyone, they only do it to victims they know can't get help. That's calculation, not heat of the moment as you'd expect with \"mental illness\". Degree of harm and scale doesn't necessitate illness either, because everyone back during slave times wasn't ill for supporting slavery, and every American in the early days who participated in the genocide of Native Americans wasn't ill either. Every parent previous to the latest generation wasn't mentally ill despite the total absence of child abuse laws. People running the Nazi death camps weren't mentally ill during the war and then suddenly not ill once they lost the war. \n\nPeople can just be horrible. People can just be selfish assholes. Transgressions are not illness, because to claim otherwise means we're right back at claiming every child is mentally ill for every disobedient act--and yes this is a weapon already in use--and things like \"mentally ill people are only angry because they're ill, it's not possible they're actually being abused, look how cute they are when they're self harming\". Illness is used as a weapon, just as racism and sexism are. Don't invent an excuse for abusers to use in their abuse, or for them to claim they didn't know what they were doing if they're ever caught. Illness doesn't remove your moral agency, it's not rabies. People are fully functional moral agents with the same full inner lives that everyone has.",

        "body": "I keep thinking what if OP had a friend with a real allergy who ate the wrong thing. Then OP tried to help them with his old or fake Epipen thinking they would be fine shortly... And it didn't work. That situation would be on OP's mom because she lied about medication OP thought he needed and had available for use. Heck, what if OP had jumped the gun after being told he ate something tainted and injected himself before Mom could swoop in and lie about switching the flour before it went into a dish? I mean, what happens to someone who gets injected with an Epipen who has no allergies? Or someone who has no allergies and an old pen?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I keep thinking what if OP had a friend with a real allergy who ate the wrong thing. Then OP tried to help them with his old or fake Epipen thinking they would be fine shortly... And it didn&#39;t work. That situation would be on OP&#39;s mom because she lied about medication OP thought he needed and had available for use. Heck, what if OP had jumped the gun after being told he ate something tainted and injected himself before Mom could swoop in and lie about switching the flour before it went into a dish? I mean, what happens to someone who gets injected with an Epipen who has no allergies? Or someone who has no allergies and an old pen? Could that hurt them?</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully I don&#39;t know the answers from experience but the whole big lie is a freaking terrible way to try to keep a kid healthy.
