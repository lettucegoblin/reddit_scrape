We got a lot of what my husband and I call \"bonus time\" with him, so I am very grateful for that. \n\nWhen my husband and I first started dating, sometimes I would forget something at his house, and I wouldn't realize until he was dropping me off at my door and I was checking my pockets. Then, I would notice some pill bottle or maybe my cell phone got left behind and his eyes would light up. \"Bonus Time!\" he would shout, as he drove back towards his house to collect my missing items. That meant 5 more minutes, 5 \"bonus\" minutes of driving time. And talking time. Maybe even hand holding time. So he never minded me being forgetful, because it just meant \"bonus time.\"\n\nFast forward 8 years. It's our wedding anniversary. We've saved up money to go on a trip and go scuba diving, just like we did on our honeymoon (it's going to be the first time since then, and we are sooooo excited!) We've started buying the scuba gear.\nThen I find a lump in my breast.\nThen I take the dog to the vet. Me, \"He just isn't acting like himself.\" Vet, \"Is there any reason why he might be stressed?\" Me, \"Absolutely, I just found a lump in my breast, we've been doing a lot of crying in our house. He's my service dog, we're very close. But he's acting like he's uncomfortable, I'd like you to just check.\" \nWell it turns out that we both had tumors.\nHere's where things get good. Because we were all set to go on vacation, we spent all that money on saving our dog's life instead. Any other time, we wouldn't have had that money. But that day we were able to say \"no problem, debit card ok?\" And we just paid for all of it at once. Then, we stayed home together for JC's entire recovery. At the end of our vacation time, when he was cleared by the doctors to start playing gently, we took him down to my family's lake house to do the last of his recovering in style, with some dog friends. JC's tumor, which was such a part of his spleen that they had to remove his spleen completely, turned out to be benign, and so did mine. I left mine in and now refer to my left breast as Tammy the Tumor Titty.\n\nJC got diagnosed with kidney failure about a year after that. He started eating a special diet immediately, which he surprised me by loving, at least until the last few months. It was like he knew what was good for him and what wasn't, because he drank water like you wouldn't believe, too. They vet's said that's why he lived so long and why he was so healthy the whole time. We also started doing saline infusions, first 2x/week, then every other day. And we gave him gabapentin for joint pain, just normal age related arthritis. My husband would also massage him to help his joints feel better. He massages me too :)\n\nEverything that happened after we had his spleen removed, we consider bonus time. There are plenty of reasons why we could have missed that tumor. And plenty could have gone wrong, even though it was benign. And there are a lot of different things I didn't go into regarding his kidney failure, that could have hastened his death. But we got lucky. And for that, for the amount of time we had, I am so grateful. Because really nothing is more valuable than time. So I thought you might like the concept of \"bonus time\". It's a phrase we use in our household regularly.\n\n\nI wish you and your wife both peace. I am so happy that you managed to get a little bonus time together.",

        "body": "Wow. I wasn\u2019t on Reddit a year ago so I just read your OP. And then after reading your update, double wow. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to face an early leave from this life, but I\u2019m glad you told your wife. She deserved to know, no matter how bad it was for her to take. I\u2019m so thankful you had the time to do some things. Be thankful for that. No all of us get that. Eight years ago, while I was spending the last two weeks of my oldest brothers life with him, and a third week where we took him to a beachfront condo for him to pass and then his services. Unfortunately he only made it 10 hours after getting to the condo, but his bed was facing the water he loved so much. Where I\u2019m going with this...two days after we buried him, and the same day we were all getting ready to go to our homes, several different states, I got a phone call that my husband had died. It was unexpected, but I was away from him the last three weeks of his life. I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye, or say one last I love you. I know I was where I was supposed to be, and where he wanted me, surrounded by my family instead of home, where it would have been me that found him, but I still think about those last three weeks, the last 3 months, the last year, before he was gone. So many things I would have done differently. I suspect he might have known in the end how sick he was, but would have never called me to worry me, considering I was eight hours away by car. But I can\u2019t change it, although I know in my heart he knew how much I loved him and he loved me. So when I read your story, even though I\u2019m now crying my eyes out (not your fault), I\u2019m so happy for you and your wife. That you all got to make memories that will stay with her forever and you had the time to enjoy each other. Enjoy the remaining time you all have and tell her every day how much you love her and that it will be ok. I survived. It was hard but she too will survive. Let her know it\u2019s ok to love again and what you need to remember is that she will always carry you in her heart, no matter what. I don\u2019t want to say goodbye, so see you later will have to do.\n\nI was reading some comments below and wanted to add something. You said you are afraid, but not as afraid you would have been 16 months ago. Here\u2019s what I know, straight from my brother. During the last two weeks of his life he came close to death. I didn\u2019t realize how close until the night I told him he wasn\u2019t going to make it. I was a nurse practitioner for years, so when the doctor told us the conditions that had developed, I knew our fight for him was over and asked the doctor if I could be the one to tell him. When I told him, his first response was \u201ctake me to a bar so I can have a beer.\u201d He was dying from cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol. I told him while I understood, that\u2019s not what we were going to do. He then looked at me and said \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. I was so close to dying the other day and I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was surrounded by peace and it felt so good. So I\u2019m not afraid to die.\u201d  It\u2019s gave me a lot of comfort, even more so through my husbands funeral the next week. I think most of our fear is having to leave the ones we love behind and knowing the grief they will feel. Once again, no goodbye. I\u2019ll see you later, on the other side.\n\nI apologize if that was all over the place. Rereading it this morning, I fixed a couple errors and things for clarification.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow. I wasn\u2019t on Reddit a year ago so I just read your OP. And then after reading your update, double wow. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to face an early leave from this life, but I\u2019m glad you told your wife. She deserved to know, no matter how bad it was for her to take. I\u2019m so thankful you had the time to do some things. Be thankful for that. No all of us get that. Eight years ago, while I was spending the last two weeks of my oldest brothers life with him, and a third week where we took him to a beachfront condo for him to pass and then his services. Unfortunately he only made it 10 hours after getting to the condo, but his bed was facing the water he loved so much. Where I\u2019m going with this...two days after we buried him, and the same day we were all getting ready to go to our homes, several different states, I got a phone call that my husband had died. It was unexpected, but I was away from him the last three weeks of his life. I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye, or say one last I love you. I know I was where I was supposed to be, and where he wanted me, surrounded by my family instead of home, where it would have been me that found him, but I still think about those last three weeks, the last 3 months, the last year, before he was gone. So many things I would have done differently. I suspect he might have known in the end how sick he was, but would have never called me to worry me, considering I was eight hours away by car. But I can\u2019t change it, although I know in my heart he knew how much I loved him and he loved me. So when I read your story, even though I\u2019m now crying my eyes out (not your fault), I\u2019m so happy for you and your wife. That you all got to make memories that will stay with her forever and you had the time to enjoy each other. Enjoy the remaining time you all have and tell her every day how much you love her and that it will be ok. I survived. It was hard but she too will survive. Let her know it\u2019s ok to love again and what you need to remember is that she will always carry you in her heart, no matter what. I don\u2019t want to say goodbye, so see you later will have to do.</p>\n\n<p>I was reading some comments below and wanted to add something.

I hope y\u2019all have put every bill and bank account in her name. It will make her life easier when she is beginning her grieving. Also plan out your final wishes so it will make going through the funeral planning easy on her. Tell her to save some of your shirts you\u2019ve worn and maybe your favorite cologne.

But it\u2019s a great comfort to me that we went through it together. We did so many things in our lives together- big decisions, little ones, life changes, etc., and we did that together too. The way he died was the way I think we all should be so fortunate to- having had a chance to do all those \u201clast things,\u201d and actively love those around you, on purpose and with finality. He passed so peacefully too, at home, which was exactly what he wanted. It broke his heart to say goodbye to our young children the day before (he was terminally sedated, which wasn\u2019t the same as \u201cdeath with dignity,\u201d but allowed the pain in his body to let up enough for his body to finally let go.) As his widow, I was relieved to have gone through his wishes and plans with him while he was living. I had a plan financially and knew what paperwork needed submitting and when, and how. It was still a lot of work but took the guesswork out of it, which could have been so heartbreaking and difficult if left to me versus his family versus his friends\u2019 opinions on things. He did everything he could to make living easier for our kids and myself, that once I submitted the paperwork and made the phone calls I needed to, I was able to just grieve. That, and parent, it he made it possible to just love and miss him without all the extra crap that comes with the death of someone you love so much. \n\nIf your wife is ever interested there are tons of amazing widow support resources out there. One wonderful group is called the Hot Young Widows Club (get past the name, it\u2019s meant to be tongue-in-cheek) and there are countless others. It really helps in the early days, both for emotional support and for support with how to submit various documents and hiccups she may run into along the way. And two years out, it\u2019s still helping, personally. \n\n\nI wish you and your family the best possible life filled with peace and kindness.",

I wish you & your wife peace during this hard time. You\u2019ve changed a lot of people\u2019s way of thinking. I am so happy I opened Reddit this AM to read this. I want to share my experience with you & what my little girl said the other day, because it really hit home & changed my perspective on things. Nothing close to your experience for sure, but still meaningful I think. Backstory-I have been a wedding planner/manager for a large hotel chain the last 10 years or so. I had my daughter 6 years ago & am a single mother with 100% placement. I have traveled all over with her & we have lived at some amazing resorts when I\u2019ve been on different assignments. Southern California, Hawaii, FL Keys etc. I was working the entire time though. Weddings every weekend. On my laptop until 2am. Constantly distracted by texts from brides. Nannies when I was had events. She was able to experience some awesome things-living at resorts with water parks, going whale watching, visiting aquariums, zoos all over the US, SO much Disney, meals prepared by awesome chefs etc. In March I got Covid  when we were visiting Vegas & it hit me hard. I collapsed & they thought I was having a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. Was hospitalized then released. I\u2019m 35 and was very healthy & active. I couldn\u2019t work. My resort I was at closed down & I moved to Wisconsin to be closer to family. We have a nice but smaller house in a little suburb. We\u2019ve been pretty isolated since March. Don\u2019t go in public at all, groceries & anything else delivered. I\u2019ve had immune issues since Covid, I\u2019ve gotten shingles twice since then. I am still recovering from this last time & in pain most of the time from them. I still get SOB, tired a lot. I\u2019ve been out of work this whole time. I am home schooling her & we have been together 24/7 since March. This summer we were in the pool everyday. We play Barbies, board games, SO many crafts & glitter, make forts, have \u201csleepovers\u201d & watch movies every night. She\u2019s always been my little best friend, but we have gotten so much closer. Dealing with unemployment is absolute hell. I know a lot of you understand. They are 8 weeks behind in paying me. There are so many obstacles & issues. I may have to file for disability at 35 if shit doesn\u2019t turn around. Anyway, we were talking about how things will be when the pandemic is over. She said, \u201cI am kind of glad there was a pandemic. We don\u2019t go a lot of places anymore, but this is best time of my LIFE!!! I want it to stay like this, but without people getting sick.\u201d Just being home and having time with me is better than any luxury or cool experience she\u2019s had. THIS is what truly matters. F the money I made when I was a workaholic. I am going to get some job working from home. Getting a certification in something else & change careers. I\u2019ve resigned from my company & am just here. In the moment. No idea what the future holds. But what I do know is my 6 year old will remember the pandemic as a super fun time she got to play with mommy every day. Yes, some days I\u2019m super sick & in pain a lot. But those days we just chill & I make her watch movies from the 90s like Honey I Shrunk the Kids all day. Lol. Blessing in disguise I\u2019d like to think. I wish you all the best. Sending you all the good vibes & love :)",
