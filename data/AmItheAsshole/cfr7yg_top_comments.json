Like classes at the local community college, or even something like a VR headset so he can try out those VR chat rooms. That way he can get out a little and talk to some other people, either IRL or virtually. I think making some friends on top of seeing a therapist would make him happy, and speaking from experience - a lot of people I met online have become true life long friends even if we don't see each other much. If his motor skills are an issue, they make specialized controllers for people to use nowadays.

That is a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe just be cautious in the future? Ask his future partners and him to dinner, to get a feel for them? Offer to help out with something so you can see what his life is like on the home front? I wouldn&#39;t expect all of his partners to be like this awful man, but I would keep an eye out, while not being overtly critical of your son. </p>\n\n<p>Just be involved, and respect your sons future choices, that is really all you can do. </p>\n\n<p>In this instance, you were a good parent. A lot of people with or without disabilities don&#39;t have that. Your son is fortunate.</p>\n</div>",

It's like he and your son are twins :/\n\nI'm glad your son his safe now. One idea I have for you is that my MIL once had to file for guardianship/power of attorney over her own adult son just to kick out a 'caregiver' who was breaking the law in his house and organizations involved did nothing. I've heard that I might have this right as well. In my country that means that even if your son is so brainwashed that he lies to everyone he is OK and wants nothing to change, you can still override everything he says, put your foot down and drag an abuser to court. I'm saving that for emergencies because I can see that its too easy to abuse.\n\nPeople like us can get trapped in abuse for decades because its our only option. For some of us it's that or starve. His last 'carer' abused both of us but continued to sit in the house because my husband didn't want to kick him out and then throw everything up in the air to find another carer we didn't need anyway. People like us and your son *NEED* advocates.\n\nYou also might want to research disabled people and boundaries. Spolier: We're usually not raised to have any.
