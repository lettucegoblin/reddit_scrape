She\u2019s literally invented an excuse to turn every holiday celebration into a way to pit the women in your family against each other and play favourites. </p>\n\n<p>If she wanted complete control over the menu then she could have chosen to cook the entire meal herself, but this way she also gets to exercise control over her daughters, daughters-in-law and nieces and have everyone falling over themselves trying to please her to prove that their meal is \u201cgood enough\u201d to be included. It\u2019s messed up tbh.</p>\n\n<p>Good on your wife for refusing to take part in it any more.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: regarding your last bit of info, if your mother is so particular about desserts then <em>she should make the desserts</em> and have everyone else bring appetisers, dishes and whatnot, since she\u2019s less particular about those. There\u2019s no non-narcissistic reason for your mother to turn Christmas dessert into a competition for her approval.</p>\n</div>",

It made heart happy. I&#39;m not a social person and it was something I cpuld contribute.</p>\n\n<p>One Easter my MIL came to me eating my cookie and said( and I&#39;m quoting I will never forget) &quot; These are so good, but my God what a waste of time. Why do even bother nobody cares.&quot; As she shoved that cookie in her face\nI stopped going over there for 10 years.  My husband supported me. It was hurtful.</p>\n\n<p>YTA....stop letting your mother treat people like this\n Holidays are about family. Its not a competition for bakers. That&#39;s just shitty\nDon&#39;t force your wife to feel bad for the holidays .</p>\n</div>",
