Those were options for both your thieves and both of them chose the lazy, egotistical way.</p>\n\n<p>Imo, leave that thing up until at least they apologize in person.</p>\n</div>",

I'm a horticulturalist and depending on the type of plant, how they took cuttings, how much they took as well as whether or not the used secateurs/garden scissors or just broke them off could make a huge difference in plant life.   \n\n\nFor example, if the cuttings are on a bad angle or are really rough because they just broke them off, bacteria can grow on the cutting tips, infecting the plant and making it very sick. The infection can spread through the rest of the plant, making it a non-viable specimen. If it's not bacteria then small pests can use that as an access to the rich, nutrient filled center of the plant and just eat it away.   \n\n\nAs an established plant, losing 25% *shouldn't* be too damaging (I've got some established plants where part of their pruning regime is to cut them down as close to the ground as possible), though it does come down to the type of plant and how big it was as well as exactly **which 25% was taken**. In my mind, I'm thinking a few stems from the mid point where it's densest and won't be noticed/missed.   \n\n\nDefinitely NTA. Respect peoples property.
