The husband passed and didn't have a will, just a verbal agreement she would get to die in that house. The house was worth a good chunk of change and his kids saw green. They forced her out and she had to die in a nursing home.\n\nI'm definitely not saying this will happen to you OP and this situation is different. But after witnessing that, I realized what can happen when you leave your partner behind without legal protections. You really never know what could happen when you're gone.\n\nAgain, congrats and i wish you both a long and happy marriage!",

The proposal wasn\u2019t a surprise or anything too crazy, but honestly, I love that we were so much on the same page and really it was just waiting on him giving me the ring that I had picked out and already tried on and being able to tell family and friends. To me it\u2019s the most romantic because I\u2019m truly excited to spend the rest of my life with him.</p>\n</div>",

It seems pretty clear to me that it's not a funny story to tell to people later. What? She wanted marriage and he said no and she said that's fine. You have no entitlement to my insurance or my house, etc. Then surprise! He has a receipt for a ring? And the statement that he said she wouldn't believe him if he didnt have the receipt for the ring. Why? Do they not have an honest trusting relationship? But the whole \"he has been actin weird even after\" is what really got me. It all seems way to friggin skeptical. Also 800 bucks a month is the mirage difference she pays vs him. And the rest went to the ring? So how long have they lived together? A year would be almost $10,000. Is the ring that much money? Fine if it is, but just curious does this really add up? 2 years would be 20 Gs. This seems so fishy to me and I am a die hard romantic. I agree with you 100%!  This feels icky is right on!!!

I had asked (more of a formality thing) her parents before hand so they knew, and it was her birthday weekend, so they had a \"reason\" to visit anyways. But I knew she wasn't into the big displays and was much more interested in a more intimate thing. \nFunny story, the night before was Valentine's Day (her birthday is the 16th, so I proposed the one day she wouldn't have expected at all -- the 15th). I had gone to my parents to pick up the placeholder ring, and also had to pick up the car we had just bought. Then on top of that I had to grab Valentine Dinner. I was running a bit late and she got stuck on transit on a rather cold evening. Then I hit rush hour traffic (because why wouldn't I?). She was suuuuuper pissed that I was so late and that it was silly cold outside. I couldn't tell her it was because I had stopped to pick up an engagement ring for her, so I had to appologize profusely, all the while not giving up the gig. She was upset all that evening (and given her lack of background knowledge on the subject, justifiably so). The next day after I popped the question, I explained that my mom had some trouble finding the ring and that was why I was late. She apologized for being upset at me, and that was that. Those are the types of stories I want to share with our future family, not \"he took me to a place I couldn't stand to be in, and live streamed it to my parents.\" \nYou will find someone who hears and sees you for the awesome person you are, and will make sure that moment is as special for you as it is for them!!",
