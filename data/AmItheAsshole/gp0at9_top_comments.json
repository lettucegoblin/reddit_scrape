You're telling me that you're still bleeding out into toilet paper when you're a heavy bleeder, and your boyfriend is still sitting huffily in another room freezing you out? YOU'RE actively suffering because of him and he still thinks he's in the right, so far as to not even help you with it as you continue to bleed??\n\nAnd you're asking us if you're the fuckup? Why does it sound like this man has such a weird level of control over you? You're allowed to ask your partner for basic things and then point out the truth if they refuse to extend themselves even a little bit for you. Why is he ashamed of women's hygiene? This is concerning because it points to some deeper views about womanhood that are frankly sad. On top of that, his harsh and hateful remark about being a \"tr***y\" is shocking. I'm not sure this dude understands basic things like compassion or empathy or consideration-- for anyone, outside the home. If he cannot even stand up to get you pads, because looking \"like a woman\" is embarrassing in his worldview, then he's not the kind of person who sees injustice and stands up for it in public. He won't help you when he's in public. \n\nAnd you seem to have accepted such disrespect AND lack of support/compassion from a chosen romantic partner, to the point that you're asking us if YOU \"stepped out of line\" here. There is no LINE to asking for what you want. You're allowed to stand up for yourself, you're allowed to call him out on his bullshit when it's hurting you. The fact that he's punishing you for it now, on top of the fact that you're still bleeding out into the worst situation ever, is awful! He is not being a partner in one of the most easy, simple scenarios of supporting your partner when things get a little tough. And life, with children and family and finances, gets a lot more tough than this. Especially from someone with sexist views and toxic masculinity, if he won't acknowledge what's wrong here then I would rethink a relationship with him. He does not sound like the kind of partner who would stand by you when the going gets tough, or support you emotionally when you'd need it. He sounds embarrassed of all femininity and all compassion. And he's punishing for his own issues with the world, when he should be acknowledging the pain he's put you in as you actively bleed into something not meant to handle heavy bleeding. What is wrong with him??\n\nI'm guessing he expects you to be the adult for him when there are potentially intimate/embarrassing scenarios like buying condoms, or servicing him in sex, but HE doesn't have to be mature when it comes to Your physical needs? Like getting pads or tampons. Or doing the hard things that must be done to help you out...? He'd be a nightmare to be pregnant with in that case. Yeesh. This is something you really needed for your health, something very regular and very well known and very Adult, and he found public perception to be more important to him than you. It's not even public perception-- it was imaginary, so it's his own internal shame at the topic of womanhood. I'm ashamed for him. This is so embarrassing and gross and sad in an adult man. You have to deal with this all the time, it's a normal body function that he's alright with when it comes to sex, but the world knowing that those functions exist is suddenly too much? It sounds like he's alright with it as long as it conveniences him or services him, but not when he has to walk outside. Ugh. The aspects of being a woman is not something to hide in shame and only use when you want to have sex or have a child. He seems comfortable with it when he gets to profit from it but this is really showing that he thinks of it like a child. Something dirty and shameful to associate with and complicated and out of his league.",

If a fucking acquaintance had a goddamn hemorrhoid emergency and somehow asked me to buy some cream, I would help somebody out. Who cares if the cashier thinks I have hemorrhoids? If you would even consider doing something along those lines, you need a better boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p>Also, think about getting period undies with washable pads and/or a menstrual cup. Better for the environment and such a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;.   More comfortable and way cheaper in the long run. :)</p>\n</div>",

Extra points for remaining good-humored while putting up a tent in the rain (I SO dumped one boyfriend for being a dick during this); or while travelling long distances.\n\nSo you've been together 2 years and lived together 2 months and you have discovered that he is transphobic AND you can't rely on him to help out with menstrual issues (how will he react when you bleed through a night pad ?!?) It may not be a dealbreaker if he pulls his horns in, but *if you cannot have a conversation with him in which he admits he made a mistake, apologises and promises to do better in the future*, then you have saved yourself a lot of future heartbreak and pain.\n\nIn the end, it's not about making mistakes. It's about being able to have an open and honest discussion, and to fix them, and move on. The fact that he's now giving you the silent treatment is as much a red flag as the rest of it; and the rest of it is a marchpast by the Red Army.",

We go through new stages with each other, until we find someone who we can live with, who cleans up after themselves without being asked, who is polite to waiters, who takes care of you when you are ill, who buys pads for you when you run out (and flowers and chocolate - extra points for that) and who you can put together Ikea furniture with. Extra points for remaining good-humored while putting up a tent in the rain (I SO dumped one boyfriend for being a dick during this); or while travelling long distances.</p>\n\n<p>So you&#39;ve been together 2 years and lived together 2 months and you have discovered that he is transphobic AND you can&#39;t rely on him to help out with menstrual issues (how will he react when you bleed through a night pad ?!?) It may not be a dealbreaker if he pulls his horns in, but <em>if you cannot have a conversation with him in which he admits he made a mistake, apologises and promises to do better in the future</em>, then you have saved yourself a lot of future heartbreak and pain.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it&#39;s not about making mistakes. It&#39;s about being able to have an open and honest discussion, and to fix them, and move on. The fact that he&#39;s now giving you the silent treatment is as much a red flag as the rest of it; and the rest of it is a marchpast by the Red Army.</p>\n</div>",

She's not his normal \"type\", but he's polite and they get along all right and talk. No third wheels for them.\n\n During the dinner he ate some bad shrimp and got a horrific case of food poisoning. While the other two people were freaking out, blind date goes into the bathroom after him after he's, oh, you know expelling from both ends. Turns out she used to babysit very young children, so she helped him get cleaned up while he's racked with cramps, and drives him to the emergency room. On the way he totally messes up her car interior. She gets him admitted, cleans up her car, then stays with him for most of the weekend while he's recovering. Even (with permission) called his parents to let them know what happened when he was mostly out of it.\n\nAfter he recovers, my friend thought about what he really needed to be looking for.  (His mother may have had some choice words for him about not dating a hussy for once, lol.) Anyway, they are happily married with three kids now.",

They also tend to be high maintenance and none of the relationships lasted very long</p>\n\n<p>He agrees to go on a blind date because his buddy&#39;s girlfriend wanted her friend to meet someone nice. She&#39;s not his normal &quot;type&quot;, but he&#39;s polite and they get along all right and talk. No third wheels for them.</p>\n\n<p>During the dinner he ate some bad shrimp and got a horrific case of food poisoning. While the other two people were freaking out, blind date goes into the bathroom after him after he&#39;s, oh, you know expelling from both ends. Turns out she used to babysit very young children, so she helped him get cleaned up while he&#39;s racked with cramps, and drives him to the emergency room. On the way he totally messes up her car interior. She gets him admitted, cleans up her car, then stays with him for most of the weekend while he&#39;s recovering. Even (with permission) called his parents to let them know what happened when he was mostly out of it.</p>\n\n<p>After he recovers, my friend thought about what he really needed to be looking for.  (His mother may have had some choice words for him about not dating a hussy for once, lol.) Anyway, they are happily married with three kids now.</p>\n</div>",
