I had a few instances of women just being so mean and holier than thou about baking. \n\nOne time we had a new girl introduced to our friend group as she was dating one of the guys, turns out she bakes, I was initially excited meeting thinking I\u2019d make a fellow baker friend, but we didn\u2019t click and she was a rude person, so we all just continued our friend group things over time and both would randomly bring baked things sometimes. But she would talk smack about me and my baking behind my back all the time and even told my BF (now husband) that I didn\u2019t like *her* because she\u2019s a better baker lol. I just quit baking for friends after that and we are no longer friends with those people. \n\nI was so into it, and I wasn\u2019t bad at it, I had landed a gig baking a restaurant\u2019s desserts and then later applied for a entry baker position at an actual bakery. The woman owner was, you guessed it, rude, and said \u201cjust because you can decorate a cake, doesn\u2019t make you a baker\u201d just because I had brought a little  portfolio with a few decorated cakes. Felt very defeated by that one. \n\nAnd then the final Cake Boss, finally got into a legit bakery later. The owners bestie came to work a few months after I started, she was also a rude bully. She wanted another girl that she was friends with in the bakery but there wasn\u2019t a position open so that woman made my life hell for months. I refused to just step down and kept at it. I made everything by the recipe to T but she\u2019d find anything and everything wrong. It eventually ended with her PHYSICALLY ASSAULTING me. \n\nI quit any kind of professional baking after that, while I loved the art of baking, it just wasn\u2019t worth putting up with these weird mean women who make it their entire personality and treat it like Highlander \u201cthere can only be one\u201d bullshit.\n\nYou proved your point and just bake for the actual people you love lol screw Ms. Cake Pops, let her know where can shove that stick haha.",

She was married and fancied herself a Susie Homemaker type, she decided I didn't know how to cook or bake because I was single (despite that I'd been doing both with my caterer grandmother since I was 8), and always refused my help in the kitchen. Once she invited me to her home with a few other people the night before Thanksgiving while she cooked. At one point I could hear her crying in the kitchen. When I went to see what was wrong, she was attempting to make white mountain frosting for a coconut cake. For those unaware, it requires boiling sugar to a certain temp, then beating it with beaten egg whites. I'd made this frosting many times and unless you're really experienced with candymaking, you *need* a candy thermometer. When I asked, she said she didn't need to use one yet burned the sugar, as well she'd attempted to \"beat\" the egg whites in a blender, overbeating them until rubbery and watery. I ran home for my hand mixer and told her I knew how to make the frosting. She actually didn't say anything this time. I started melting sugar and checked for soft ball stage in a glass of cold water, beat the egg whites & everything else, then beat everything together. It looked great. Don't know why I thought she'd be happy or maybe even thank me, but I didn't expect the complete anger I got in return. I didn't understand it then, I get it now. We were the only two in the kitchen, I hadn't told anyone else there what I was doing and didn't plan to, but she called me a pathetic showoff, said that I was jealous of her life and needed to show her up. I decided to leave at that point, made an excuse to my friends who were there, and went home. \n\nAt dinner (I have no idea why I still went to her dinner - low self esteem I guess?) when someone complimented the cake, she had the balls to say \"Thanks, the frosting was really difficult but I made it myself!\" I just stared at her open-mouthed, put my fork down, wrapped up the dish I had brought, and left without saying a word. This was before texting or Facebook and MySpace, so there were no passive aggressive social media posts and she didn't call me. I only saw her a few times in passing after that and only cordially said hello if I had to. My life is richer for not having her in it.",

At the very least I'd make like half of what I normally do for the 20-30 people that usually show up. Hell, that's less work for me and I get to try someone's new recipe. But I'm more than just \"the egg lady\". These people all love me for a ton of reasons and while I love to cook and I, and they, all think I'm quite good at it, it's not my identity. Maybe in that family, that's who she is and she feels like she has to protect that status because she doesn't feel like much else. I don't know the dynamics in that family.",
