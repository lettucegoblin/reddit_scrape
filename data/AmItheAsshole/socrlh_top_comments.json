Literally had my lunch stolen too many times to count in this 9 month span, alone. Other people were going through the same thing. I actually had gotten a verbal warning because one day I had enough and put signs up. My hubby is a truck driver and wasn't local to just bring me something. And the location of our office wasn't somewhere I could just walk and grab something in a half hour. We only had one car at the time and my husband usually dropped me off at work. So being pregnant and left with no lunch multiple times made me hit a new level of pisstivity. And to be written up for being pregnant and hungry for literally hanging paper asking to not steal ppls lunch instead of getting to the bottom of who was STEALING in the bldg was wild. I ended up quitting. Loved my job but management didn't gaf about nothing but productivity. And I always exceeded my quotas. I still wish eye styes on that lunch thief to this day.",

I'd be pretty pissed off if someone at work stole my lunch too but I'm pretty lucky and most of us bring in a lot of snacks to share between us on breaks or if we happen to get a gap between calls. I've also gone in and didn't have time to make or buy anything for work (woke up late a few times) and have been kindly offered food off other members of staff, although I still wouldn't resort to pinching food off someone else if I hadn't been offered anything. I've offered food myself plenty of times before now too to colleagues who have forgotten to bring anything in as quite frankly I buy way too much food for work lol as for the whispering and shit talking, don't worry about it. I've always entered a job with the attitude of I'm their to work and earn a wage, not to make friends, thats just a bonus if I do. I can honestly say I worked in a retail job for 7 years and hated every minute but it paid the bills, was talked about a few times and it bounced right off my head. This job I've been fortunate enough to make a very good friend who recently made me god mum to her child so I feel very privileged. To me this would be a non issue tbh, I'd be pissed for a day and then just not give a shit what other staff thought of me in regards to someone else stealing off me. You did the right thing and I'm sure they won't be doing it again any time soon. Good on you!",

I&#39;d be pretty pissed off if someone at work stole my lunch too but I&#39;m pretty lucky and most of us bring in a lot of snacks to share between us on breaks or if we happen to get a gap between calls. I&#39;ve also gone in and didn&#39;t have time to make or buy anything for work (woke up late a few times) and have been kindly offered food off other members of staff, although I still wouldn&#39;t resort to pinching food off someone else if I hadn&#39;t been offered anything. I&#39;ve offered food myself plenty of times before now too to colleagues who have forgotten to bring anything in as quite frankly I buy way too much food for work lol as for the whispering and shit talking, don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ve always entered a job with the attitude of I&#39;m their to work and earn a wage, not to make friends, thats just a bonus if I do. I can honestly say I worked in a retail job for 7 years and hated every minute but it paid the bills, was talked about a few times and it bounced right off my head. This job I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to make a very good friend who recently made me god mum to her child so I feel very privileged. To me this would be a non issue tbh, I&#39;d be pissed for a day and then just not give a shit what other staff thought of me in regards to someone else stealing off me. You did the right thing and I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be doing it again any time soon. Good on you!</p>\n</div>",

Everyone knew it was him, he was a sales guy so wasn't in the office that often, and food only went missing when he was around.\n\nSo one day I go to get my leftover pizza out of the fridge and find it's missing, I knew he was in the office that day, and I saw red.  I stormed over to confront him, found him sitting in a colleagues office, and let him have it.\n\nMe: Did you eat my pizza?\n\nHim (chuckling and reaching for his wallet): Let me just give you some cash-\n\nMe: No, it's not about the money.  It's about you disrespecting my time.  I don't have time to drive to grab fast food today and was planning on eating *my leftovers* at my desk.  Do you think your time is more valuable than mine?  Is that why you steal my food rather than going out to buy something for yourself?\n\nHe got really quiet and hunched over and red in the face and muttered an apology.  I stormed back to my office to cool down, thought about it, felt bad about yelling at him like that in front of the whole office, and spent the next 24hrs beating myself up about being such a hothead.\n\nMy boss came into my office the next day, and I immediately apologized for how I handled it, but he stopped me and said, \"I owe *you* an apology ...we've known about him stealing food for years, and it was up to me to deal with it, and I didn't. So I owe you a sorry and a thank you, because I don't think he will ever steal food again after that dressing down.\" Apparently I had so shamed the offender that he actually turned himself in to HR! \ud83d\ude02 And btw he never stole food again, so I became the office hero.\n\nNTA, OP.  There's nothing worse than an office food thief, and I guarantee you aren't the only victim, but you're probably the last one!",
