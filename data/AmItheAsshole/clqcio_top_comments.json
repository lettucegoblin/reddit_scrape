Typical defence, though: It's your fault I slept through geography and you're mean.\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of basic geographic education is common with private school educations. Was it a religious High School? They're just the worst. My husband's parents went to religious HS and religious College. I distinctly remember them asking me why I would want to read any book (except the bible) which I didn't have to read for school. I was 27 and reading Heinlein's \"Stranger In A Strange Land\", at the time, and couldn't put it down. This completely mystified them. They also couldn't point out any states or countries on a map of the world. Truly sad. \n\nI frequently asked my husband if he was sure he wasn't switched at birth. The man was brilliant, and he came from them?? Wowzer.",

Typical defence, though: It&#39;s your fault I slept through geography and you&#39;re mean.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this lack of basic geographic education is common with private school educations. Was it a religious High School? They&#39;re just the worst. My husband&#39;s parents went to religious HS and religious College. I distinctly remember them asking me why I would want to read any book (except the bible) which I didn&#39;t have to read for school. I was 27 and reading Heinlein&#39;s &quot;Stranger In A Strange Land&quot;, at the time, and couldn&#39;t put it down. This completely mystified them. They also couldn&#39;t point out any states or countries on a map of the world. Truly sad. </p>\n\n<p>I frequently asked my husband if he was sure he wasn&#39;t switched at birth. The man was brilliant, and he came from them?? Wowzer.</p>\n</div>",
