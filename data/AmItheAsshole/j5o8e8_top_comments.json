        "body": "If he's been allowed to stay in his position for this long, HR is likely enabling it. \n\nThe kind of things people got away with at my old job was *wild*. They deliberately hired people who were younger/ fresh out of school because we were easier to manipulate. At the time I left, the COO of the company was 27 years old and in a relationship with the 40 something year old CEO (who staged a coup to oust the former CEO and COO). \n\nJust a few highlights from my *four* years with them: \n\n* A coworker reported that she was being harassed by one of the drivers whenever she had to do a run with him. The HR director at the time (the woman who became COO) \"investigated\" by asking all the drivers if the woman had ever been flirtatious with them. She was called back to HR and informed that one of the drivers said that they heard that she was bisexual, so the accused probably felt that his advances would be welcomed. They told her to stop telling her business to people at work. Didn't even bother separating the two of them. A sympathetic transportation supervisor ended up separating them as a courtesy.\n\n* On multiple occasions, that same driver would pull over and piss inside bottles/cup *while I was in the van with him*. He would pass up multiple gas station and store restrooms (I recommended several because I knew the area and I always keep a mental note of all the \"clean\" and free bathrooms around the neighborhoods I frequent in case I need to use one) and *always* opted to pee inside the van. When I reported this, the managers straight up laughed at me, and HR didn't even bother to follow up with me. I thought I was overreacting until the new transportation supervisor took over two years later and kept talking about disgusting he thought the whole thing was. \"Lucky\" for me, I didn't have to ride with that driver anymore because *he* felt uncomfortable riding with me. \n\n* The former transportation supervisor was known for asking women out on dates, flirting with them, and getting upset when he was rejected. We were paid overtime for doing runs with the drivers, so there was a schedule in place to ensure no one ended up with too much OT. He'd constantly try to swap out the women who rejected him for women who were more receptive. At one point there were 3 or 4 women who were constantly fighting each other, only to eventually learned that he was feeding all of them lies about the other trying to \"steal\" him. \n\n* There was another driver (are you seeing the pattern here?) who was reported for sexual harassment multiple times within his first month on the job. He wasn't even formally reprimanded, he was just pulled to the side by the director (his friend) and told to cool it with the flirting (he didn't). His response was to mope and pout about how the women were targeting him until enough of us felt guilty enough to pretty much allow him to harass us.\n\n* Another driver required a Spanish speaking matron because he spoke very little English. Every single one of his matrons complains about him making comments about their bodies. He was the CFO's father, so... they just created an all male run and gave him a male matron.\n\n* The CEO came up with several new dress code policies specifically to fuck with one staff member. The CEO took offense when this guy declined to remove his hat when he was called to the office. Up until that point, hats were not prohibited. Hat, sunglasses and the type of shoes that this guy was known for wearing were all prohibited within the week. the CEO then when on to explicitly threaten to target and harass this guy because he accidentally transferred a call to his office during a meeting. \n\n* The CEO showed up to one of our staff meetings and badmouthed the entry level in an attempt to make us (case managers, one step above entry level) feel more important I guess? He didn't realize that an entry level staff was sitting right behind him. The Deputy CEO and tried to call a mandatory meeting that same day to \"clarify\" what the CEO meant... and to forbid us from discussing it with other employees.\n\n* HR and certain managers regularly showed up to unemployment hearings to lie about the circumstances leading to former employees' termination. They lost every time because the lies were ridiculous and easy to disprove, but they kept doing it anyway.\n\n* The one time HR acted swiftly was when a (white, cis, male) employee reported that the (Black, cis, male) janitor crumpled crackers on his desk after they had been bickering non stop for weeks. The janitor was suspended for a few days... the shift supervisor (a Black woman) was demoted for not reporting that she saw the cookies get crumbled. \n\nAt the time I left, they company couldn't even afford to cut keys for new employees because they were deeply in debt from paying multiple lawsuit settlements, *and they still had multiple active lawsuits against them*.\n\nI'm shocked everytime I find out that they're still open, but I think the pandemic was the final nail in the coffin.",

For foreign workers, the notice is often more than just saving face, but saving being deported for being unable to find another job in time.</p>\n\n<p>When you have a place that refuses to either give or accept notice, that place is shooting itself in the foot and will get a bad rep among current and potential future employees.  They don&#39;t have to, legally, but they&#39;re better off doing so from a business point of view.  Excluding fly-by-night scam operations, it&#39;s mainly delusional bosses running places with poor business processes who fail to do so.</p>\n</div>",
