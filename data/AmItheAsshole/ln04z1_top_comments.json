We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there.\n\nSo I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn\u2019t speak again. \n\nFast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle. \n\nHe was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. \n\nMy ex had backed out of the abortion but didn\u2019t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn\u2019t know about that. Apparently I wasn\u2019t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn\u2019t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn\u2019t properly care for her. \n\nHe asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.\n\nKara messaged me and we\u2019ve been talking. I\u2019ve met her twice and it\u2019s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we\u2019re just barely getting to know each other\n\nSo far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.\n\nWe met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.\n\nI had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn\u2019t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.\n\nThat night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They\u2019re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. \n\nYes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.\n\nSo right now I feel like shit. I get \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d but in this case I don\u2019t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I\u2019m still learning this whole \u201cdad\u201d business so don\u2019t know if I dropped the ball here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Probably late teens early 20s. Their relationship was very short. He likened it to a match. It was very hot and bright at first but soon fizzled out. My mom never wanted to abort me, my parents just never worked out. My mom passed away when I was 3. My grandparents got custody of me shortly thereafter. My grandma most, lied to me a lot about my biological dad. She said things like \u201che beat your mother, he never wanted you, he couldn\u2019t take care of you, he was a drug addict.\u201d My grandfather just lied by omission by never wanting to truly talk about the situation. While my dad did sign his rights away, he was more or less forced. My grandparents took him to court and as a man living paycheck to paycheck, he had no money for a lawyer or to fight for his rights. My grandparents made it super difficult for him regarding any sort of visitation and all of that coupled together he signed his rights away. I wasn\u2019t aware of who he was until I was around 17 and my step sister - for lack of a better word (the woman he was with, after my mom passed away, daughter.) She reached out to me and told me that he loved me so much and would talk about me always. Her and I were around each other briefly while the custody battle took place. Once my grandparents won custody I never saw her again. Anywho, she reached out to me and I had all these thoughts and feelings to sort through. She was trying to tell me my biological fathers side and I questioned a lot. Once I turned 18, I finally reached out to him and wanted to hear his side of things. He never painted a bad picture of my mother but it definitely changed my perspective of her. My grandparents painted her as an Angel, as any parents would. I don\u2019t fault them for that. They were wrong in a lot of the situations and definitely could have went about things better. I\u2019ve had to basically take information from both sides and construct what I believe truly happened. I still love my mother regardless, it just opened my eyes to the fact that my mom was not perfect and the stories they told me - did have truth to them but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth. She\u2019s going through a lot right now. My grandparents were upset when I found out I was speaking to my bio bad because the reality they constructed for me wasn\u2019t 100% truthful and they knew they were going to get caught. All of this happened 7 years ago and I can say that it\u2019s all water under the bridge now. Like I said, she\u2019s going through a lot right now. She\u2019ll just need some time to adjust and honestly she might need some therapy. I know I probably should have but...here we are. At the end of the day you nor her can change anything....just move forward one day at a time. I wanted the truth from my bio dad as I had hunches here and there my grandparents weren\u2019t being truthful. She\u2019s 19, not a child. Honestly was the best way to go and you\u2019re NTA. \nMy bio dad and I\u2019s relationship is super strong today and I cherish our relationship..I\u2019m so glad I made the decision to reach out. I\u2019ll be sending you good vibes and if you ever need someone to talk my DMs are open.",

She left the relationship and did not tell him she was pregnant. She kept my brother and lost all contact with this man. She never told my brother growing up who his father was. Especially since my step dad came into the picture when my brother was 12 months old (1 year old). Unfortunately his last name was his biological fathers last name but by mom somehow managed to use her last name for school etc. When my brother was around 12 his biological father murdered a man to death snd has been in prison (looks like he\u2019ll continue to be there for awhile). My mom had always wanted to tell myself brother that my step dad was bit his biological dad but then he murdered someone and is serving a life sentence in prison. So messy. Eventually when my brother was around 16 he wanted a drivers license, which meant he would find out his actual last name. So my mom had a sit down conversation with him. Not only did he find out his dad was actually not his biological dad but that his biological father is in prison for stabbing a man to death. And he molested his sister and abused his mother. And if he wanted a name change legally the man would need to be informed even in prison. \n\nMy mom definitely should have told my brother much sooner.

Unless they were REALLY involved with the mom\u2019s life, they probably didn\u2019t know many of the particulars beyond a messy breakup and assumed mom had good reason to not want OP to be a part of daughter\u2019s life. And with mom dying at around the age you might consider telling daughter the truth (or maybe when mom would have, we don\u2019t know her plans), that makes untangling this lie even more tricky.</p>\n\n<p>I guess there\u2019s a case that they shouldn\u2019t be this mad at OP, but I don\u2019t think they acted totally unreasonably and you\u2019d expect them to be upset that OP didn\u2019t spare them the fallout of mom\u2019s lie.</p>\n</div>",

Thing is she said some stuff when I was a kid about him that she now denies saying and I never asked when I was that young because I didn't really care about it until I was older and also remember not wanting to be unappreciative that she was raising me by herself. Anyways I think it was more she married my stepfather and had my brothers and sister and now doesn't want to bring up the past . My siblings used to think he was my dad as well and ask why I called him by his name instead of dad and my mom would get upset when I corrected them saying he was my dad now. Don't get me wrong he's an alright guy though. One thing I remember asking why she chose my name when I was younger and I swear I remember her saying it was the name of someone on my dad's side of the family, want to say his father but that i don't fully remember but when I brought it up a couple years ago she denied ever saying that and it just seemed like a nice name. My last name isn't actually her maiden name either so I know it's my father's last name which is why I think he walked away because otherwise why would she give me his name if she didn't expect him to be a part of my life. I have tried searching my name on sites but both are so common it's like a needle in a haystack. I haven't really asked about him in years but the last time she just said what does it matter and basically told me to drop it.",
