He finally got into gaming on twitch because all he did was play video games. Eventually, he talked me into making an appearance on his stream, and it turned into my gaming stream. He'd sit on the sidelines while I played.\n\nIf you get him the nice setup, he probably won't even use it it to stream. Or maybe he will, but it requires a LOT of work to make it on twitch, and there's no guarantee. It's very easy to get kicked off the platform. All trolls have to do is report you, and you're done.\n\nIt doesn't feel like a stable plan to me. If there was some guarantee of him getting a job if it didn't work out, then I would say maybe do it, support him in following his dream, but the way you described it, it doesn't feel like his dream. It feels like he thinks he can just get a cool setup and find easy success when it doesn't work like that.\n\nIt feels like he's resentful because you don't want to go along with fully taking care of him. Even though that wasn't the original agreement. He basically bait and switched you. You signed up for a guy with a job and what you got was someone completely lacking in ambition... not a teammate, like I'm sure you wanted. Does he have mental health issues he's not addressing?\n\nThis feels like a mother/son relationship.",

He&#39;d sit on the sidelines while I played.</p>\n\n<p>If you get him the nice setup, he probably won&#39;t even use it it to stream. Or maybe he will, but it requires a LOT of work to make it on twitch, and there&#39;s no guarantee. It&#39;s very easy to get kicked off the platform. All trolls have to do is report you, and you&#39;re done.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t feel like a stable plan to me. If there was some guarantee of him getting a job if it didn&#39;t work out, then I would say maybe do it, support him in following his dream, but the way you described it, it doesn&#39;t feel like his dream. It feels like he thinks he can just get a cool setup and find easy success when it doesn&#39;t work like that.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like he&#39;s resentful because you don&#39;t want to go along with fully taking care of him. Even though that wasn&#39;t the original agreement. He basically bait and switched you. You signed up for a guy with a job and what you got was someone completely lacking in ambition... not a teammate, like I&#39;m sure you wanted. Does he have mental health issues he&#39;s not addressing?</p>\n\n<p>This feels like a mother/son relationship.</p>\n</div>",

I have a friend who is a successful YouTuber, and he didn&#39;t start doing it full time until he was consistently bringing in at least as much from his channel as he did from his regular job over a period of several months. Difference being, he&#39;s a responsible adult and not an overgrown teenager with dreams of taking the easy way out and no concept of how much work it actually is running a successful channel. Even if he does get to make his living literally playing with toys, he works his ass off, and he does it all with the expectation that it&#39;s temporary because the algorithms are fickle, so he has to be able to either pivot or start something entirely new at any point.</p>\n</div>",
