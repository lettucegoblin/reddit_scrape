It seems to me you've been conditioned to feel less for a long time and the chance you'd finally see your beauty flipped the cousin who should've stopped your self deprecating talk years ago and built you up like a sister.\n\nEither way NTA and find a salon that handles hair types 3 and above.

So your reddish blonde hair will look amazing next to that dress.  </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m a little bratty.  If you don&#39;t go... I want to suggest something maybe snotty and petty... wear the dress.  Do your hair.  Go someplace beautiful.  And have someone do a photo shoot so forever in the future when someone says &quot;you should have...&quot; you have all these pictures of you dancing around a meadow or in a crowded crosswalk of people not dressed up, shining like a jewel.  Outside so the sun lights up all the colors.  To a fast food place all reds and yellows then to a spa all green.  Figure out places that offer bouts of color - bedding departments in stores or something so you can show how it looks in front of everything!  For her to want the entire room to just be a sea of that color - kudos to her for trying to visually plan her day... but her obsession with you is beyond color scheme.  You will upstage in that dress, and she knows it.</p>\n</div>",
