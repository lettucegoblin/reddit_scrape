There is nudity and gore in every single episode. Watching it where someone else's kid can see it is rude. OP is TA.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Finally, for those telling the mom to tell the kid to just not look - what the hell? Have you ever interacted with a kid? Tell a kid not to do something and they are going to find a way to do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right?!? It&#39;s like the people suggesting that have never met a child. You tell a kid not to look at that tablet and the kid is going to spend the entire flight trying to watch the screen without mom noticing. It&#39;s really not hard to avoid graphic media when you are confined in a flying tin can with other people. The first season of GoT is the season famous for sexposition. There is nudity and gore in every single episode. Watching it where someone else&#39;s kid can see it is rude. OP is TA.</p>\n</div>",
