They're jealous you have a family, but also angry because they know if your family truly knew you that you wouldn't have them anymore. They feel their family knew them and abandoned them. Your friend wanted you to feel exactly the way they feel: incapable of being loved.\n\nThere's this psychological theory that people do bad things in order to have someone \"see\" their bad side and yet still love them. It's a way for them to grasp at the feeling of being intrinsically valued/loved for simply existing. We usually get this from our parents, but when they don't provide that we tend to act up looking for someone else to fill that role. That's the theory, anyway.\n\nSo, your friend feels they're in the situation they are in because no one intrinsically loves them. They see your situation in which your family *appears* to intrinsically love you, but in fact they don't. Your friend has known the entire time that there is a part of you that would cause your family to disown you, and they HATE that you were able to hide the \"bad\" about you from your family, while your friend wasn't able to keep their \"bad\" side hidden.\n\nSo they exposed your \"bad\" side to your family to both prove to themselves that you aren't intrinsically loved, either, and to make you feel the abandonment that they are feeling by you not helping them.\n\nChances are high that they didn't want help finding a way onto their feet... They wanted to *join your family* so they could feel the intrinsic love that bounces around your household.\n\nIt's incredibly sad when people get to this state. But understanding WHY your friend has gotten here does not mean you should forgive them or let them back into your life. It is impossible for your family to fill in the void that is in your friend's heart, and so they will continue to cause massive grief and disruption as they try to use you to make their heart feel better. \n\n*Because* they already targeted you as a means to make themselves feel better, *you are not in a position to be able to help them.* In a way, your friend knew this. Part of why they burned the bridge back to you is because being around you is too painful for them.\n\nThe next phase of their journey is their own.

She was now in 5th. He had been MIA for years and not even the Mom mentioned it to me. I found the paperwork in her very thick file. My student had been in Bilingual, then ESL, and was G&T.

I say she is out of the room delivering treats to other teachers. I then get a neighboring teacher (SPED with no homeroom so she didn't have kids that day) to supervise my class. I take the girl to Art classroom to hide -then run to the back way into the front office. I pulled her file and get the counselor and principal and show them the parental rights termination paperwork. He had brought custody paperwork from earlier in the divorce, so they were going to hand her over. The cops were called and he was arrested.

Custody paperwork now gets its own color of folder. Teachers are required to sign off that they have looked at it at the start of the year.  Later they got a new attendance system that allows us to flag kids at risk for this type of custodial interference. And that thing they put your driver's license /ID through and it prints out a name tag. It is running a background check and will flag for things like this. It also notifies the cops if you show up at school with warrants. Great for people with a history of violence.
