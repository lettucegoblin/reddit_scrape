He suggested that every time I want to do something different I wait a week and if I still really like it then he'll take me.

I distinctly remember one day sobbing in her bathroom telling her I\u2019d never be her perfect Barbie daughter that I knew she wanted. I was around Anna\u2019s age. I\u2019m 31 now and my mom still makes ongoing negative comments about my hair (as in she tells me I look like a dyke if my hair goes above my chin, for example), clothing, etc. because she still thinks she knows best and wants to exert control even though I haven\u2019t let her control me since high school and have worked on boundaries. I\u2019m telling you, Anna has already internalized the messaging she she\u2019s her mom\u2019s plaything and she can\u2019t be own her person around her. And only Anna\u2019s mom can work on undoing that damage.</p>\n</div>",

Was this the first big haircut? \n\nSit down kids, it's story time!! \n\nMy twin boys are two; one of them used to have beautiful, thick, curly dark hair. I loved it. I took care of it or it would get tangly. A couple months ago, my ex-husband decided he was going to take the kid to a barber shop and chop it allll of until it was like .5-1\" long, because he said it got matted all the time, which tells me he didn't comb it enough or use the right leave-in conditioner. Now... did the haircut look great? Yes. Was I devastated? Yes. My little boy suddenly looked very grown up, and I was not ready for him to look so grown up. My boys are all I have. I will likely never have more children, because I'm a single mom that just turned 30. I can feel my eggs dying within my poor ovaries. I hear them screaming while I ovulate. \n\nOk, so it's not really that bad. What I'm trying to say is that being forced to see that your babies are growing up is a confusing and painful experience. To me, seeing the time fly by makes me feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the day when they no longer need or want be around; to the day when they no longer let me hold them and tell them I love and that I'm proud of them as they fall asleep.\n\nAh, shit. Okay, maybe I need therapy for how upset I am just thinking about them growing up.\n\nEither way, if this was that girl's first haircut, I can kinda understand the mom's reaction even though it was waaaay overboard. There's no way it was JUST because her daughter's long hair let her pretend that she wasn't growing up.\n\nI don't even know how to TL;DR this shit. I'm so sorry.",

OP needs to have a conversation where he outlines how he\u2019s recognized her behavior as emotionally manipulative, controlling, and abusive. He needs to underline how it\u2019s harming their daughter, AND himself. This is the moment to tell her they need couples and individual counseling or that they need to separate and him maintain primary custody until she\u2019s worked on her harmful behavior. Anything less is going to cause this poor little girl long term emotional struggles and increase her chances of getting into unhealthy friendships/relationships as she gets older.</p>\n</div>",

Though I can understand now, that back in the day that rule might have had more sense as the parents were literally considered responsible for their children's appearance and kids back then could get into serious trouble at school for wearing hairstyle or clothing that was considered inappropriate by the teachers. And still, in those times, people thought when the child is big enough to take that responsibility, they may decide. So in the end it was probably quite progressive then. They would think it was too controlling to not the children after that. And I guess it was practical, because they could expect that the kid of a controlling parents would do more extreme things to their hair, and starting at 16 would give them a few years until adulthood to experiment and calm down before entering workforce or university.   \n\n\nWhen I think of it, I remember when I was a small kid (late 80's/early 90's) there were some teenage girls who 'always' had very long hair and got a radical haircut or perm when they were 16-18, so they could be from families who didn't let them decide until later.",
