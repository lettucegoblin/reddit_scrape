They were already getting to small but they got a big hole in the knee and I was sad, but instead of fixing them my dad made the hole bigger and we had to throw them away, and I was devastated. I was maybe 5, but I still remember because childhood favourites mean everything at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, now I realise dad didn&#39;t realise how much I loved them, and I was a kid that liked knocking thing over, so him breaking things with me was supposed to be a bit of fun. But it still makes me irrationally sad when I think about it.</p>\n\n<p>Some things stick. Either that little girl grows up with a weird hatred of elves or she grows up and realises &quot;that wasn&#39;t a misunderstanding, that was a malicious act designed to make me feel bad, and that was my dad.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Mile\u2019s determination to do away with OP\u2019s ex\u2019s birthday tradition for Andy in itself shows a weird/jealous insecurity. It\u2019s so obvious he\u2019s got it out for Andy, as Andy\u2019s bday was the crescendo to all of this bullying with the Elf. The elf is merely the conduit for his mean spirited behavior. \n\nI\u2019m extremely concerned about him cutting up a little girl\u2019s onesie while she\u2019s sleeping. Uhhh wtf?! In a world where little girls are abused by authority figures (mostly men) that\u2019s extremely not okay behavior for a parent to do. Then writing on the other kid\u2019s face like a frat boy? Nope, not okay. A prank is something harmless like filling someone\u2019s entire room with balloons or releasing a bucket of bouncy balls when it\u2019s unexpected. The pranker AND the prankee BOTH get a laugh out of it & no one/nothing is harmed or destroyed by it. Miles, on the other hand, is specifically looking to punish others and make them cry. He gets off on it because he\u2019s insecure & needs to feel superior in the moment. That\u2019s called being a bully. \n\nOP needs to consider that Miles\u2019 inappropriate behavior probably doesn\u2019t just extend to Christmas. Him gaslighting her over the Elf and the previous bday tradition for Andy just tells me this is not an isolated incident. I would release Miles back into the wild (aka a frat house) and get a lawyer. He\u2019s a mean bully who is just going to keep getting meaner to get his sick high out of causing her and her kids mental anguish. Leave him. Any man who would purposely ruin a child\u2019s bday & Christmas is not worthy of being a father or husband.",
