It bothered me because I have work committments (I'm a nurse) and my schedule can unpredictable, and so he caused me issues at work for dropping his kid off at my house without telling me first.\n\n\n\nLast week he did it again, He came over at 6pm and entered my house with my nephew (he had a spare key) while I was showering and left the house immediately. I got out of the shower and was shocked to see my nephew standing there alone. I asked where his dad was and he said he just left.
