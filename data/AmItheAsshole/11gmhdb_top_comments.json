It doesn&#39;t matter if they can&#39;t tell the difference, your wife feels like you don&#39;t value her family and she has a point. Either spend difference in cost on her family in a different way they will appreciate eg buy a gift, make cocktails etc or just give them the same steak. Your wife&#39;s feelings are more important than your steak snobbery (and I say that as a foodie).

They're not lesser people than you because they don't like their steak the same way you do.\n\nThat said, the entire point of super-high-grade meat is that it brings out certain flavors etc. at certain levels of doneness and overcooking it destroys those, therefore there's no reason to buy that meat if you're not going to make use of that.
