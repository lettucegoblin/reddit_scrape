Having never touched a drug or even cigarettes in her life, she understandably considered weed on par with cocaine.  Her generation was hit pretty hard with the anti weed campaign.  My father is still positive just weed caused his buddy to jump off a building, thinking he could fly.  \n\nMy mother still doesn\u2019t like it, but she accepts it now.  It was a battle I happily fought because all of the other positives about my mother made that effort worth it, also because she genuinely feared for my health and mind. \n\nSo, my questions- have you tried drilling into her head weed isn\u2019t the devils plant?  Showed her some studies?  Showed her where a government official straight up admitted they fabricated weeds dangers after prohibition so they could keep their jobs and target the black community?\nMaybe try that?\n\nAlso, if you are anything like me, you want to relax after getting home from work.  Perhaps she isn\u2019t thinking of all the work you do all day at work, but just what she saw - you smoking and then getting \u201clazy\u201d.  That seems to also be a big concern for the old ones.  Not that I\u2019m suggesting you are in any way lazy - just that sometimes parents take things to extremes based on what they see.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to excuse your mother for what she did, it is inexcusable.   I also don\u2019t know your relationship, and if she would even listen to you, or if you think it\u2019s worth it to try.   \n\nI think you did the right thing, you made a pretty fair ultimatum, all things considered.  You could have (and had every right to) kicked her out immediately.  It was her choice not to comply, and continue living with you.\n\nYour brother thinks you are a jerk because now he has your mother.    You were very fair.  Also, I\u2019m pretty dang jealous about what you pay.  Seriously, I\u2019m crying a little inside.

I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.\n\nI have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.\n\nAt first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still\u00a0 a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect.\u00a0\n\nThe next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment.\u00a0\n\nWell, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.\u00a0 So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.\n\nAnyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away.\u00a0\n\nShe obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My generation (Gen X) is mostly in favor of it. Honestly, a lot of boomers are as well. The only problem is that the people who are the loudest and most uptight about it will reliably show up at the voting booth, city council meetings, etc. to rant about it. I think it makes public perception seem different than what it actually is.</p>\n</div>",

You would want a system where the doctor could look at his situation, look at a police report, and be allowed to give him an exception, but that's also exploitable. \"Stolen\" and \"lost\" scrips are commonly used to procure more drugs to sell/abuse. Laws are poor for highly nuanced situations. Ideally, you'd trust the doctors to know their patients and do their jobs, while having an overseeing body (not of their peers, either) to make sure to weed out the bad apples. The situation isn't dissimilar to the current discussion about policing.\n\nI think ideally, we need to acknowledge that pain and addiction are both medical issues that need to be treated, even if one caused the other. We unfortunately stigmatize addiction in this country and it's tough to get help from politicians because they all want to be tough on drugs. I read something years ago about a European city (I think it was Amsterdam) opening methadone clinics in the city, providing free needle exchanges and free methadone. They wanted to curb the transmission of communicable diseases, give help to those who wanted to kick their addiction and even offer a safe, clean space to shoot up. It was eye opening to see a government acknowledging (but not condoning! different things!) that people use drugs and working to stop other harmful side effects.

        "body": "I had an emergency bowel resection when my bowel literally burst open while I was about 7 months pregnant.  They essentially removed 90% of my large intestine and colon and approximately 25% of my small intestine.  It threw me into early labor simultaneously, and I was in and out of consciousness and have never experienced such pain in my entire life! The paramedics simply thought I was in pre-term labor, despite my rapidly distending stomach (filling with necrotic gas).  Needless to say, they delivered my son early and despite his size, he was ok.  I however, was not. I was placed into a medically induced coma while my surgeon approached my family with the request to remove they dying/dead bowel and put a temporary ileostomy in place.  Since I would have died otherwise, they agreed.  I was fortunate that the surgeon that was on call that night decided that he would make the ileostomy temporary, as I was so young (26).  Most wouldn't have bothered.   I also endured a host of other complications and nearly passed away multiple times. However, a few months later, my surgeon kept his word and reversed the surgery.   I, yet again, was unused to the levels of pain I was experiencing *daily*! I had seizures, blackouts and intermittent vertigo.  Consumption of essentially anything caused severed pain and nausea.  If it hadn't been for marijuana (which is still not yet legal where I live), I doubt I would have survived the years to come.  My son will be twelve come December. \nI will likely have permanent placement of an ileostomy sometime in my future, but that day hasn't arrived so far.  I praise you for your amazing outlook, strength and fortitude!",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I had an emergency bowel resection when my bowel literally burst open while I was about 7 months pregnant.  They essentially removed 90% of my large intestine and colon and approximately 25% of my small intestine.  It threw me into early labor simultaneously, and I was in and out of consciousness and have never experienced such pain in my entire life! The paramedics simply thought I was in pre-term labor, despite my rapidly distending stomach (filling with necrotic gas).  Needless to say, they delivered my son early and despite his size, he was ok.  I however, was not. I was placed into a medically induced coma while my surgeon approached my family with the request to remove they dying/dead bowel and put a temporary ileostomy in place.  Since I would have died otherwise, they agreed.  I was fortunate that the surgeon that was on call that night decided that he would make the ileostomy temporary, as I was so young (26).  Most wouldn&#39;t have bothered.   I also endured a host of other complications and nearly passed away multiple times. However, a few months later, my surgeon kept his word and reversed the surgery.   I, yet again, was unused to the levels of pain I was experiencing <em>daily</em>! I had seizures, blackouts and intermittent vertigo.  Consumption of essentially anything caused severed pain and nausea.  If it hadn&#39;t been for marijuana (which is still not yet legal where I live), I doubt I would have survived the years to come.  My son will be twelve come December. \nI will likely have permanent placement of an ileostomy sometime in my future, but that day hasn&#39;t arrived so far.  I praise you for your amazing outlook, strength and fortitude!</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Oh wow. Thank you so very much for sharing. What a horribly rough journey. Mine is similar. \n\nMy Dad has severe Crohn's and a colostomy. When I was 7, I started having GI symptoms. At 9, I was finally diagnosed with Crohn's. They had done many other things before a colonoscopy as back then the thinking was you had to be awake to help them. So, they were VERY painful. That changed as they became more common with colon cancer awareness. \n\nAnyway, I was diagnosed at 9. By 15, I had severe disease. From 15-23, I had fistulas (channel infection) that channeled in my rectum and anus. I had severe GI bleeds. Had been on every approved Crohn's med, every off label Crohn's med,  and NG feeding tube treatments without eating or drinking by mouth for months. I had accidents where I'd shit myself, during adolescence. I had hospitalizations. Learned how to self inject medicines. Had been fighting for years to not have the surgery as my body was trying to kill me. \n\nI finally consented, to have rectum, anus, colon removal (protocolectomy), but I did it so late and I was so sick. My perianal line (they sew your butt together like a Barbie butt) became infected. It channeled into vaginal and uterine tissue. It was bad. My gut was full of adhesions by the end of it all. I was cleared post-op a year after the first surgery. I had additional surgeries during that year and a wound vac. It was hard.\n\nBut, then it was  a month or two after getting cleared and it was spring. I was sitting outside. And my then significant other said, \"your getting the tacos.\" For the first time in my life I had tacos. The flavor. The spring. It was one of the happiest moments. Then I lived. \n\nI go to baseball games and watch the entire thing. I drove from NH to PA to be in my best friend's wedding and that included hours stuck in traffic. I ate food I had never had. I backpacked. I camped. I went to concerts, the ocean (in a bikini), birthday parties, graduations, and I lived. \n\nThen one night I woke up with a bowel obstruction and longer story short five years after that incident I have applied for disability. \n\nSome days I feel like the Crohn's won, and I'm mad.  Then I remember I'm here and you can have a good disabled life and if I have the ability to take care of myself then I can get better. My dad was on disability for about 10 years. He had a doctor suggest one more surgery. My dad consented. Days after surgery he said I'm done with disability. He was. So, more often then not I say, \"I lost this little battle and I am gonna win the war.'  \n\nIf you end up permanent (I hope you don't have to have more surgery), call every single ostomy company and get samples of all of their stuff. The system I have I knew it was \"the one\" when I put it on and it didn't feel to me like I had a bag in the way the others I tried did. Work with the WOCN (ostomy nurses) and have them look at it annually.if you end up with a permanent illesotomy  Also, be prepared it is likely from what I've heard, going to be way different psychologically then temp. was.\n\nEdit: ordered the last paragraph better for clarity.\nEdit 2: added a little more detail about the surgery for clarity.",

And my then significant other said, &quot;your getting the tacos.&quot; For the first time in my life I had tacos. The flavor. The spring. It was one of the happiest moments. Then I lived. </p>\n\n<p>I go to baseball games and watch the entire thing. I drove from NH to PA to be in my best friend&#39;s wedding and that included hours stuck in traffic. I ate food I had never had. I backpacked. I camped. I went to concerts, the ocean (in a bikini), birthday parties, graduations, and I lived. </p>\n\n<p>Then one night I woke up with a bowel obstruction and longer story short five years after that incident I have applied for disability. </p>\n\n<p>Some days I feel like the Crohn&#39;s won, and I&#39;m mad.  Then I remember I&#39;m here and you can have a good disabled life and if I have the ability to take care of myself then I can get better. My dad was on disability for about 10 years. He had a doctor suggest one more surgery. My dad consented. Days after surgery he said I&#39;m done with disability. He was. So, more often then not I say, &quot;I lost this little battle and I am gonna win the war.&#39;  </p>\n\n<p>If you end up permanent (I hope you don&#39;t have to have more surgery), call every single ostomy company and get samples of all of their stuff. The system I have I knew it was &quot;the one&quot; when I put it on and it didn&#39;t feel to me like I had a bag in the way the others I tried did. Work with the WOCN (ostomy nurses) and have them look at it annually.if you end up with a permanent illesotomy  Also, be prepared it is likely from what I&#39;ve heard, going to be way different psychologically then temp. was.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: ordered the last paragraph better for clarity.\nEdit 2: added a little more detail about the surgery for clarity.</p>\n</div>",
