Just because he doesn\u2019t agree with what\u2019s going on doesn\u2019t make it abuse and frankly it\u2019s fucked up that people are always pushing that narrative on every AITA. Sleep is so important for everyone, especially developing brains. Getting back into a good sleep schedule even after only a week can be extremely difficult for anyone, let alone kids. ALSO people saying \u201cthey\u2019re not even his kids\u201d??? So if he didn\u2019t give a fuck about them he\u2019s an asshole but because he does he\u2019s also an asshole? I hope you don\u2019t use all these stupid comments as confirmation bias to your ridiculous behaviour because YTA.</p>\n</div>",

My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yea this guy is seriously bad news. </p>\n\n<p>It always boggles my mind how people can ignore the red flags and think that &quot;marriage&quot; will make it all better. That&#39;s never the case.</p>\n\n<p>If you see red flags before embarking on a legally binding agreement (that will cost you thousands not to mention mental and emotional wear and tear), then get your ducks in a row. End the engagement and get out of there. Or remove the offending party.  Either way.</p>\n\n<p>I wish people would stop minimising or justifying shitty, abusive and controlling behaviour. If someone loves you, they don&#39;t treat you like this.</p>\n</div>",

If she\u2019s not asleep by 7:30, we are all fucked the next day. It kinda sucks but setting kids up for success is key. </p>\n\n<p>All that said, we went to Disney last year, and bedtime doesn\u2019t exist in the magic kingdom. That was a rough transition back, but damn it\u2019s vacation!</p>\n</div>",
