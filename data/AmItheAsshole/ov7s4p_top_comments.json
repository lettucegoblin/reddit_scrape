It sounds an awful like they are talking some good smack behind your back and mutually raising the level of disdain...Until they are reminded that you are someone who directly affects the trust and their access to its funds.  I personally wouldn't trust them as far as I could pi ss on them (and I'm a woman), and I would be asking for receipts for purchases.  The receipts wouldn't be a power play, but rather just to insure that your nephew is getting what he needs and is entitled to, and to keep the mom and her gold digger from using the funds to finance their vacation or next vehicle.  I do agree with others that without regulation, those people would raid that trust bone-dry, then tell the kid, \"Oh, we spent it all raising you!\" by way of apology when he reached the age of majority.  My guess is that the adults' resentment comes from them being both highly materialistic and quite dismissive of anything that doesn't fit their idea of what a \"good\" (IE, expensive) gift is, and therefore taking your heartfelt offerings to your nephew as cheapness, instead of the thoughtful sentimentality that it clearly is.

Being an executor of an estate or a trust is a very responsibility-laden job, and your doing this for your nephew shows a high level of integrity.  I get that it's a way to honor your brother and look out for his kid, who obviously needs his inheritance protected.  As your nephew gets older, keep cluing him in on the function of the trust, as well as what it is meant to do for HIM...Not his mom, not his half-siblings, and not his stepfather.  I would highly suggest you proactively counter any \"you owe us this!\" mentality being sown into the kid's brain by his parental units, because I can assure you, once your nephew can access those funds himself, Mom and Stepdad are going to have a hand out, a sob story, and a massive dose of guilt for him.  \n\n\nDon't feel an ounce of guilt about not making things for your SIL's other children.

        "body": "NTA! Your efforts, thoughtful self-made gifts, and love are invaluable to your nephew (perhaps as he gets older) as a link to his father and his family. Regardless of how the mother, and especially her new husband, disrespectful them. It does sound like they place more value on money, and don\u2019t consider that the toys you have gifted have additional meaning of family connection and thoughtful work while making them. Also, some people just measure life with price tags\u2026 You can rarely change them. If this is the case, it places even more value on your gifts that show the love and care they were made with. I place more value on handmade items, but to be fair, I make most gifts myself too. You might even teach your nephew crafting & woodworking skills in the future, something his dad might have done. Your gifts will spark and help that interest. \n\nRegarding money: I hope I am wrong, but fear that they plan to finance their life and their twins\u2019 life with your nephew\u2019s money. I am a cynical 50yo who has seen many a family & friendships break up over money and entitlement, so fair warning. I am very relieved your brother had the insight to give you control of your nephew\u2019s finances. I would urge you to consider in advance, if you can put in place additional safeguards that the money truly will go yo your nephew and not the other siblings. \u00a3500K for a life sounds like the insurance company certainly screwed your nephew over. That amount is not much if you consider the cost to raise a child, especially if you have to factor in private schools etc. So I urge you to get a few professionals to give you advice on how to safeguard and maybe even grow the funds so your nephew will have stability at least financially, and will have enough to launch himself at adulthood. Also ask what would happen in term of trust if something should happen to you prematurely. I am a firm believer in planning and covering all options, and sadly prepare for people to behave at their worst when money is considered. \n\nI apologize for the rambling text (on a mobile, and jumping around while writing). I am so glad your nephew has you in his life. Safeguard that relationship, and be the male role model he deserves. Your brother would be proud of you. I wish you and your nephew all the best for the future.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA! Your efforts, thoughtful self-made gifts, and love are invaluable to your nephew (perhaps as he gets older) as a link to his father and his family. Regardless of how the mother, and especially her new husband, disrespectful them. It does sound like they place more value on money, and don\u2019t consider that the toys you have gifted have additional meaning of family connection and thoughtful work while making them. Also, some people just measure life with price tags\u2026 You can rarely change them. If this is the case, it places even more value on your gifts that show the love and care they were made with. I place more value on handmade items, but to be fair, I make most gifts myself too. You might even teach your nephew crafting &amp; woodworking skills in the future, something his dad might have done. Your gifts will spark and help that interest. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding money: I hope I am wrong, but fear that they plan to finance their life and their twins\u2019 life with your nephew\u2019s money. I am a cynical 50yo who has seen many a family &amp; friendships break up over money and entitlement, so fair warning. I am very relieved your brother had the insight to give you control of your nephew\u2019s finances. I would urge you to consider in advance, if you can put in place additional safeguards that the money truly will go yo your nephew and not the other siblings. \u00a3500K for a life sounds like the insurance company certainly screwed your nephew over. That amount is not much if you consider the cost to raise a child, especially if you have to factor in private schools etc. So I urge you to get a few professionals to give you advice on how to safeguard and maybe even grow the funds so your nephew will have stability at least financially, and will have enough to launch himself at adulthood. Also ask what would happen in term of trust if something should happen to you prematurely. I am a firm believer in planning and covering all options, and sadly prepare for people to behave at their worst when money is considered. </p>\n\n<p>I apologize for the rambling text (on a mobile, and jumping around while writing). I am so glad your nephew has you in his life. Safeguard that relationship, and be the male role model he deserves. Your brother would be proud of you. I wish you and your nephew all the best for the future.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Well, yeah, YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that your effective-SIL\u2019s new husband was rude. What he said was absolutely out of pocket and I\u2019m sure it was frustrating, even insulting, to hear your sister in law side with him on this.\n\nIt seems, however, like you\u2019ve misunderstood control for authority. You do hold the reigns of your nephews money, but there are some things to remember\u2014 the first is that this \u2018entitled\u2019 individual was and now permanently is your brother\u2019s chosen partner. You emphasize that they were not married, which misunderstands what a commitment is. The fact they were not married only means that, as a result, you have a supplemented control over his estate which would not otherwise exist, which would, in fact, be hers. By rights, the money left behind should be hers, with the inseparable assumption that it would contribute and (hopefully) facilitate your nephew\u2019s upbringing.\n\nYour efforts still exist though. You do show up. I\u2019m sure you do try to be a positive role model to you brothers son. I\u2019m sure that the toys (which are a demonstration of affection, not of support) are appreciated. They do not make you a saint and they do not make you a craftsman. From what you\u2019ve described, while they do take effort, it feels wrong to describe them as handmade toys, whether hands were involved or not. Factories still need bodies. They are, in effect, no different from a toy purchased at a department store. Nice, well intentioned, but ultimately of relatively little consequence.\n\nYou lord control of money over them, even if only to the internet, not to their face. You seemingly do not commit your own income in any way to this child (because it seems you wrote off your brothers partner a while ago). The toys, while kind, are not necessarily generous. It\u2019s true, something is better than nothing, but again, it doesn\u2019t make you a saint.\n\nYour sister in law had your brother to rely on in helping raise this child. They obviously had a sexual, and presumably a developed romantic relationship. Losing family is hard and I\u2019m not going to pretend you didn\u2019t have to do your own grieving, but I\u2019m sorry\u2014 her loss was the greater one. Your nephews loss was the greater one. \n\nYour sister in law, by requesting a second set of toys, is not being entitled. She\u2019s recognizing the limits of contribution that you are willing to make and you\u2019re demonizing her for being reasonable and working within those boundaries. \n\nYou had an argument that somebody picked. I understand being hurt. I understand feeling unappreciated. They\u2019re not asking you for something unreasonable and it does feel like the sticking point may be more that the new children aren\u2019t \u201cblood.\u201d So yes, I\u2019m sorry for everyone in your family\u2019s loss, but you are the asshole.",

If I were OP, I\u2019d be more cautious about the money while also treating the new kids like they\u2019re part of his family. Which may mean making a gift or two. Just to be kind! (And maybe to distract from your new, cautious approach to the big money. Which is, after all, the thing most worth protecting for your nephew). Plus we\u2019re talking about family relationships. Sometimes you pick your battles for the sake of kids.</p>\n</div>",
