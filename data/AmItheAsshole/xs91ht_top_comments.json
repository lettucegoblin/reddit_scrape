And they knew it - they knew they weren't inviting you when they were asking for every revision, etc. Shame on the wedding planner too - she should know what it's like to have people take advantage of services provided for a wedding. \n\nIt might be petty, but I would re-send the invoice with the new full price and a note that says: \"At first, our price for our professional services was inclusion as part of the family at the blessed event. Then it became the cost of our materials when you decided to exclude us while using our products for your event. Now, you can pay full cost, because instead of realizing your rude and cheap behavior to a family member who showed you generosity, you doubled-down and have people harrassing us. Payment is due before delivery, via certified or cashiers check, so you can't cancel it.\"",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. Astounds me how people expect things for free from friends and family at all - much less free stuff for an event that they decide not to invite you to! And they knew it - they knew they weren&#39;t inviting you when they were asking for every revision, etc. Shame on the wedding planner too - she should know what it&#39;s like to have people take advantage of services provided for a wedding. </p>\n\n<p>It might be petty, but I would re-send the invoice with the new full price and a note that says: &quot;At first, our price for our professional services was inclusion as part of the family at the blessed event. Then it became the cost of our materials when you decided to exclude us while using our products for your event.
