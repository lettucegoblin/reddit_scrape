This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nI have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9\" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me \"slim\" and I even heard her say one time \"go ask toothpick\" and she has said stuff like \"you need some meat on your bones\" & \"you need to eat\". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. \n\nToday when she said \"morning slim\" I replied \"morning chunky\" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is \"different\" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a \"compliment\". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's \"a high school issue and we should figure it out\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The gastroenterologist and Hospital determined it was an emotional thing because my mom, her grandma, passed away in November due to gallbladder cancer.  My daughter was very close to her...and a few months before my mom died, my girl started experiencing what has been determined to be \u201cphantom pain/sympathy pain\u201d.  Same area of stomach as my mother.  Very real for her.,.its become a mystery that has very much affected her life.\n\nAfter all the tests and hospital stays we\u2019ve been through, we have no physical answers and it\u2019s very hard for her to eat. She struggles with a plate of food the size of a toddler\u2019s meal. She hates it, she\u2019s not anorexic\u2026 But this strange illness has not gone away. She feels completely full after a few bites...to the point of pain. It\u2019s frustrating and scary.  She weighs 79 lbs at almost 14 years old, height is 5 feet even.\n\nMay I ask what you have found out about your daughter medically?  Are there any similarities to my daughters issue?  I\u2019m Asking because I have not met anyone yet who is struggling with the same thing, or who has any answers, ideas, or advice.",
