I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth. \n\nEvery year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it. \n\nI asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.\n\nI thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The only way to get back in her good graces is to submit and grovel to her, but you should not do that, because this cycle will continue.\n\nI would recommend searching out some more info on this subject, I have found Dr. Kim Sage\u2019s videos recently and they have given me some great insight into some of the normalized family dynamics I grew up with were quite toxic. Perhaps her videos will not resonate with you in the same way, but there are many other alternative out there to that I think would help you quite a bit.\n\nWish you the best of luck on this journey of enlightenment.",

That would be pretty entitled behaviour if they were demands (and let\u2019s face it - they are demands) upon her own birthday.\n\nThe Queen gets two birthdays. One her actual, biological birthday and one her official birthday (which looks more like an awful day Trooping The Colour in the London rain-and she doesn\u2019t get to keep those gifts at Trooping The Colour either). Think about that - your mother is more entitled than the Queen of England.\n\nThis woman is projecting about toxic family members. She is triangulating family members against you. Then gaslighting you & your siblings into thinking it is they/you acting entitled.\n\nI doubt very much that these family members on FB have any idea about how extreme these demands are. Mention what your sister got when your mum got a MacBook and mention that you cannot afford to gift your sibling the gift you\u2019d like to because your mums gift is so expensive. Mention whatever else there has been that you had to buy your sibling because the demand from your mother was so high. Mention that instead of celebrating your siblings birthday you must all celebrate your mother\u2019s birthday six times a year. Put the emphasis on not being able to treat siblings what you\u2019d like because you are all so busy treating her - don\u2019t give her the ammunition to be able to say you are behaving out of jealousy - rather, that nobody can afford to treat each other because homemade gifts are not enough for your mum.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet she demands the attention at each of the get togethers too. And that it\u2019s just easier for everyone to go along with her demands rather than deal with the toxicity that comes from not doing so.\n\nDon\u2019t be gaslighted by your mother or those passive aggressive relatives. YNTA. She really is. You\u2019d probably be a lot happier if you took a step back (of several miles if steps back) from her.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Not just gifts either. Homemade gifts are not enough- they must be monetary gifts. They must be gifts of and exceeding $300 necklaces and MacBooks!</p>\n\n<p>Wow! That would be pretty entitled behaviour if they were demands (and let\u2019s face it - they are demands) upon her own birthday.</p>\n\n<p>The Queen gets two birthdays. One her actual, biological birthday and one her official birthday (which looks more like an awful day Trooping The Colour in the London rain-and she doesn\u2019t get to keep those gifts at Trooping The Colour either). Think about that - your mother is more entitled than the Queen of England.</p>\n\n<p>This woman is projecting about toxic family members. She is triangulating family members against you. Then gaslighting you &amp; your siblings into thinking it is they/you acting entitled.</p>\n\n<p>I doubt very much that these family members on FB have any idea about how extreme these demands are. Mention what your sister got when your mum got a MacBook and mention that you cannot afford to gift your sibling the gift you\u2019d like to because your mums gift is so expensive. Mention whatever else there has been that you had to buy your sibling because the demand from your mother was so high. Mention that instead of celebrating your siblings birthday you must all celebrate your mother\u2019s birthday six times a year. Put the emphasis on not being able to treat siblings what you\u2019d like because you are all so busy treating her - don\u2019t give her the ammunition to be able to say you are behaving out of jealousy - rather, that nobody can afford to treat each other because homemade gifts are not enough for your mum.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m willing to bet she demands the attention at each of the get togethers too. And that it\u2019s just easier for everyone to go along with her demands rather than deal with the toxicity that comes from not doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be gaslighted by your mother or those passive aggressive relatives. YNTA. She really is. You\u2019d probably be a lot happier if you took a step back (of several miles if steps back) from her.</p>\n</div>",
