A lot of people are going to automatically assume that your child isn\u2019t gonna have a good life and that you both are too immature to properly parent. Unfortunately naming your daughter after a fictional half human half vampire   destined to be married to a werewolf isn\u2019t going to ease these fears. I know you\u2019re not supposed to care what other people think but watching your kid get left out of play dates and birthday parties (which happened with my daughter just because I was younger and they didn\u2019t take me seriously) is hard enough... then throw on the teasing she will probably endure because kids are mean. KIDS ARE MEAN. Don\u2019t give the ammo. Esmae is pretty... I\u2019m sure you can find something you both like that will allow your daughter to flourish outside of this character. \n\nAs for your significant other saying it\u2019s set in stone because it\u2019s on Instagram- you can say it was a joke. People will accept it as a joke because... well I\u2019ll just leave it at that.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA taking my opinion of twilight completely out of it... anyone who has even remotely come into contact with twilight knows that name and naming your baby that will forever set her up to an entire life of saying \u201cyes I\u2019m named after that\u201d and then having to listen to people inject all of their opinions on a book and character that have nothing to do with her as a person. </p>\n\n<p>Also I was a young parent and you two are already gonna get enough shit from people.

Children are real, living, breathing people, not characters - and they don't stay children forever! And to be blunt, being named Renesmee because of the Twilight books will absolutely get her bullied. Renesmee in the novels is a child forever - your daughter will not be, and deserves a name that she can put on a job application without fear of employers thinking it's a joke.\n\nI also wanted to offer Twilight-inspired suggestions that could help you both either find a compromise or give a sweet nod to the name Renesmee.\n\n* The obvious compromise is to **make Renesmee a middle name**, so that she can choose whether she wants to be called Renesmee or her first name as she gets older; however, I totally understand if that's not something you want to do.\n* Bella and Edward chose to name their daughter Renesmee as a combination of their mothers names - Bella's mother being **Renee**, and Edward's mother being **Esme**. You could choose either one of those if you like them.\n* When Jacob imprints on Renesmee in the book, he nicknames her Nessie (much to the ire of Bella, lol). Nessie can also be short for **Vanessa** (further shortenings: Vanna, Nessa), or **Nessarose** (further shortenings: Nessa, Rose, Rosie).\n* There are other beautiful girls names from the book that you could consider if you like, and some more gender-neutral names that could go both ways. I listed out the characters that had main mentions on the [Twilight wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters), but if you look into the different covens and tribes there's other girls names in there too:\n   * **Bella**\n   * **Alice**\n   * **Rosalie**\n   * **Jasper**\n   * **Carlisle** (could be shortened to Carly)\n   * **Victoria**\n   * **Lauren** (this could be either Bella's human friend or a shortening of Laurent from the vampires)\n   * **Riley**\n   * **Bree**\n   * **Sam**\n   * **Embry**\n   * **Leah**\n   * **Jessica**\n   * **Angela**\n   * **Erica** (female version of Eric from Bella's group of human friends)\n   * **Emily**\n   * **Rachel**\n   * **Rebecca**\n\nI hope this helps!",

He&#39;s decided he wants to be in his daughters life, we don&#39;t necessarily have to be together, but I have him told there&#39;s going to be none of the in and out bullshit, because that&#39;s how my early years were before my mom met my stepdad, my dad was in my life when I was convenient and that messes a child up for life.</p>\n</div>",
