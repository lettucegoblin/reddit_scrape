We joked about being birthday twins every so often.\n\nAnd the time I lived in one town and worked in another, and would go to the gym in that town after work. Most that friend group lived in the gym/work town. Both were close so it\u2019s not like a long drive to hang out. On my birthday at the gym I ran into a couple in the group.

When it came time to cut the cake, it was supposed to be the person with the next birthday that does the cutting and serving.

You being there can back fire on those girls plans. Make them look insensitive. If your friends are good friends they will not ignore it\u2019s your birthday too. Neither will your brother. \n\nIt\u2019s a good time to figure out who your friends really are. And watch this weird event unfold. If you go and not a single person says anything nor your brother. You will now know they all kinda suck. But I don\u2019t think that would happen.",

And I wonder what your closest mutual friends would think of this. Like \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we celebrating twin\u201d? I feel it\u2019s better to go. You should go and as you sit there celebrating YOUR BROTHERS BIRTHDAY it will appear very ODD to most who are sitting there that not bringing you into the celebration is WEIRD. Not going makes it easy to celebrate your brother without you. Like \u201coh he had plans\u201d... easy out for the party planners. Your brother will feel weird. You being there can back fire on those girls plans. Make them look insensitive. If your friends are good friends they will not ignore it\u2019s your birthday too. Neither will your brother. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good time to figure out who your friends really are. And watch this weird event unfold.

My boyfriend had no idea that it was just for me til the cake came out. I was fuming, my brother was upset and he and his girlfriend had figured they wouldn\u2019t be that tone deaf, but they were. They didn\u2019t know my brother or his girlfriend that well, but they were acquainted and my boyfriend even said pretty well exactly what your girlfriend did - they could have contacted him to work something out for both of us. He would have got in touch with my brothers girlfriend, invited some of my brothers friends too and made a whole big thing of doing it together. Brother was aware, but didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. When the cake came out, I saw his name missing and my jaw hit the fucking floor. Brother looked like he wanted to cry. And my boyfriend and his girlfriend were stunned. I asked where his cake was and the look of shock on the face of the chief organiser when she said \u201cthere isn\u2019t one\u201d was a sight I\u2019ll never forget.

Nobody knows me better than he does.\n\nI think too you should tell your brother. Real friends would be understanding of the need to hold space for you too in these type events. These people sound tone deaf. Needless to say, I\u2019m not near as close as I used to be with that group, and me, my brother and our respective girl/boyfriends bailed shortly after.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nWIBTA for not attending my twin brothers surprise birthday dinner when I am only invited as a guest \n\n\nWould I be the asshole for not attending a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother \n\nSo I\u2019m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n\nNow, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends.\n\nThis feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it. \n\nIn the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c<em>my brothers name</em> surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought.

        "body": "\"Hey. So, I'm sorry if this comes off as combative or rude or anything like that, but I have to be honest.  You've kind of put me between a rock and a hard place.  On one hand, you've arranged a surprise birthday for my twin, which is absolutely wonderful and kind, but on the other hand.... it's my birthday too.  I love my brother, and I love the thought you guys put into this for him, but it doesn't sit right with me that I have to show up early to a surprise birthday for someone else on what is also my birthday.  I think I'm going to have to politely decline attending the party for that reason. I won't say anything to (brother's name) about your surprise party, but I am going to plan something earlier in the day for us to do together because we've always celebrated together. I hope you understand.\"\n\nEdit: To everybody saying that this is \"too passive,\" that's the point. The point is to be *polite*, explain how you're feeling and why, and not cause a ruckus.  Some of you are way too eager to be violent or aggressive over things.  If you're going to reply to my comment complaining about the way it is composed, (\"it's too long, it's too polite\"), please be forewarned that I don't care. This is what *I* would say, were I in OP's shoes, even with the edit of their post.",
