Wouldn\u2019t Chris be making more money? \n\n- Chris made a snarky and unprofessional remark to Henry at work where Henry is his subordinate and a relative (in a loose sense) that he recently met? Even though, according to your post, your beef is with Kat and not Henry? \n\n- How new is this job for Henry (and Chris)? How big is this company? I find it odd that if he reports to Chris that they never met during the interview process or at very least (conveniently) before the family event in which they \u201cfirst\u201d met in person. \n\n- Wouldn\u2019t it have been more fun to shove Chris\u2019 job and title and finances that clearly outshine Henry\u2019s in Kat\u2019s face in person? Instead Chris did it to Henry at work\u2026? Isn\u2019t the beef between you and Kat, not Chris and Henry? So what benefit did Chris get from being rude to Henry? To tell you later and y\u2019all laugh that he told Kat and she got pissed? What is this, high school? \n\nLike, whatever, keep Chris\u2019 job and position and finances a big secret to piss off Kat (although I don\u2019t see how that gives you revenge or a laugh or whatever), but Chris is the AH for embarrassing Henry like that when Henry did nothing wrong to you nor to Chris.

Wouldn\u2019t Chris be making more money? </p></li>\n<li><p>Chris made a snarky and unprofessional remark to Henry at work where Henry is his subordinate and a relative (in a loose sense) that he recently met? Even though, according to your post, your beef is with Kat and not Henry? </p></li>\n<li><p>How new is this job for Henry (and Chris)? How big is this company? I find it odd that if he reports to Chris that they never met during the interview process or at very least (conveniently) before the family event in which they \u201cfirst\u201d met in person. </p></li>\n<li><p>Wouldn\u2019t it have been more fun to shove Chris\u2019 job and title and finances that clearly outshine Henry\u2019s in Kat\u2019s face in person? Instead Chris did it to Henry at work\u2026? Isn\u2019t the beef between you and Kat, not Chris and Henry? So what benefit did Chris get from being rude to Henry? To tell you later and y\u2019all laugh that he told Kat and she got pissed?

And now Chris has created awkward tension at work, so that\u2019s cool.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re not an AH, just immature.

I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.\n\nI have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of \"just trying to help\", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. \n\nI'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)\n\nKat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to \"let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding\". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.\n\nLiterally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment \"tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering\". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my \"duty\" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was \"blindsided\" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Henry isn't responsible for his wife being a braggart, so it's definitely a little unfair for your husband to embarrass him *in front of coworkers in a new workplace* in response to *his wife's* inappropriate behavior.\n\nEDIT: I'm on the fence whether this would've been okay in a private meeting, for the record. I think it absolutely would leave Henry feeling uncomfortable and insecure in his current role to have had this interaction, like his boss may end up behaving unfairly and retaliatory towards him based on his wife's actions with his boss's wife in private... but maybe said sincerely enough the tone could've prevented that? Chris shouldn't have risked it either way tho.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>INFO</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not the asshole, but tbh, your husband might be for this...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment &quot;tell Kat -OP- and me don&#39;t need help but thanks for offering&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...<em>if</em> he did it in front of other staff members. Henry isn&#39;t responsible for his wife being a braggart, so it&#39;s definitely a little unfair for your husband to embarrass him <em>in front of coworkers in a new workplace</em> in response to <em>his wife&#39;s</em> inappropriate behavior.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;m on the fence whether this would&#39;ve been okay in a private meeting, for the record. I think it absolutely would leave Henry feeling uncomfortable and insecure in his current role to have had this interaction, like his boss may end up behaving unfairly and retaliatory towards him based on his wife&#39;s actions with his boss&#39;s wife in private... but maybe said sincerely enough the tone could&#39;ve prevented that?

It's so important for upper management to be mindful and careful of inherent power dynamics, and not going out of their way to have a \"comeback\" to someone on their team. *But* given that Henry was throwing the company name around to brag in general conversation, and describing an imminent promotion that isn't in line with reality, I think Chris's response might fall in the area of gentle career coaching. If Henry is choosing to essentially publicly represent the company in this unflattering way when he thinks no one (from work) is watching, then that does affect his work. I think as long as Chris treats him fairly to a fault going forward, this could be good for Henry.\n\nI was in Henry's shoes myself years ago as a college student. I had just started a competitive program at my university that had required an entirely separate application process. Shortly after starting, one evening I went with my much older sibling to a public speaking event that was completely unaffiliated with my university and on the other side of town. I was *always* desperate to impress my siblings and parents, and basically endlessly mugging for their approval in one way or another at that age. So in keeping with my general desperation for any \"attaboy\" crumbs I could grab, while we had taken our seats and were waiting for the event to start, I was bragging to my sibling about how well I was already doing in the program. I also said I was already the department chair's favorite. Halfway through the event later, someone two rows up turned in their seat, and I realized in absolute horror that, against all odds, at this tiny random speaker event in my giant city, my department chair was here. \n\nA few days later, in passing, she slyly mentioned something trivial from that conversation with my sibling in passing, as a way of letting me know she heard every word. I wanted to die, but sitting with that mortification prompted genuine character growth on my part, and in retrospect, I think she was doing what a good professor does by making that comment that let me know she heard what I said. She prompted reflection and reminded me of the consequences of being a blowhard jackass in a professional environment, a valuable lesson to learn long before I entered the professional workforce.\n\nI think maybe this situation is similar. As long as Chris is fair and supportive to Henry as a member of his team going forward, and focuses more on developing/coaching Henry into a better employee than he does on scoring points, then this feels like a valid leadership tactic. Better Henry get a gentle redirection on this behavior now than, say, in front of clients. **That said,** if Chris is just focused on the part where he got revenge on an asshole, and isn't thinking about this through the lens of his responsibility as a leader, then I agree this is ESH.",
