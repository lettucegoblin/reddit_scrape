I\u2019m not one to normally say this because of its overuse on here, but this man is gaslighting you to the point that you couldn\u2019t even enjoy your own sister\u2019s wedding. He expects you to stay home all the time, never do anything for yourself, and focus only on your kids. And on top of that, allows his mother to verbally abuse you too. Your kids will eventually see and hear what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s\u2026 really horrifying. \n\nPlease take the time to really assess your situation and get out. Get a part time job, maybe online so he doesn\u2019t know, get your own bank account, and when you have enough saved up, contact a lawyer about divorce and the kids. You\u2019re still young. You should not have to deal with this for the rest of your life.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. To be honest, this post was anxiety inducing. Do you realize that he essentially baby trapped you? That he is expecting you to forget about your family, forget about any interests outside of the home and your kids, that anything you have or do that\u2019s personal, is shameful? I\u2019m not one to normally say this because of its overuse on here, but this man is gaslighting you to the point that you couldn\u2019t even enjoy your own sister\u2019s wedding. He expects you to stay home all the time, never do anything for yourself, and focus only on your kids. And on top of that, allows his mother to verbally abuse you too. Your kids will eventually see and hear what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s\u2026 really horrifying. </p>\n\n<p>Please take the time to really assess your situation and get out. Get a part time job, maybe online so he doesn\u2019t know, get your own bank account, and when you have enough saved up, contact a lawyer about divorce and the kids. You\u2019re still young. You should not have to deal with this for the rest of your life. And your children shouldn\u2019t be raised in a home where their mother has been reduced to whatever form your husband thinks is suitable.</p>\n</div>",

Is he doing his share as a father and being a parent or does he \"babysit\" his own kids one evening a month? Both of you should be taking care of the kids whenever he's NOT at work.\n\n>When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn't going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same.\n\nWhat does that even mean? In my eyes, \"staying for the kids\" would be something one partner does so the other can go to the event. \"Both of us should stay for the kids\" is the same as every other weekend (nobody's attending the wedding).\n\nBut that's just the communication beforehand. The real issue is him being controling. This obviously wasn't about him not wanting to care for his own kids or he wouldn't have objected to leaving him with your friend. For some reason, I think it was either about him not wanting you to go to the wedding (out of jealousy?) or about him not wanting you to be an independant woman at all.\n\nI believe you should really think about his behavior and if you want to subject yourself to it in the long run.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Holy sh_, NTA.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m a sahm (full time) and I take care of the kids while my husband works (full time).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I had to, I would guess you&#39;re not just taking care of the kids while your husband is at work. Is he doing his share as a father and being a parent or does he &quot;babysit&quot; his own kids one evening a month? Both of you should be taking care of the kids whenever he&#39;s NOT at work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn&#39;t going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does that even mean? In my eyes, &quot;staying for the kids&quot; would be something one partner does so the other can go to the event. &quot;Both of us should stay for the kids&quot; is the same as every other weekend (nobody&#39;s attending the wedding).</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s just the communication beforehand.

He would lie, control & manipulate her in the beginning, but as soon as they had kids that stepped up a gear, & the night after the wedding was the first time he hit her, now she was legally tied to him. He gradually isolated her from her friends, tried to isolate her from family events unless he could be there to control her, what she said, who she talked to, & even how she dressed.\n\nI'm sad to say but your husband is showing so many signs of being a controlling & abusive partner, I would suggest you try to look at your marriage objectively - imagine this was a friend's marriage, would you think their marriage was an abusive one, would you think her & her kids were safe in that marriage, what would you say to that friend if you were being slowly eased out of contact with her by her husband's commands & ultimately, would you urge your friend to leave that abusive & controlling environment?\n\nMy sister's MIL was also a tool her husband used against her, \"see mum thinks I'm right, you're just stupid & don't understand things my way\" is not a sign of a supporting, loving partner. Please, please, consider reaching out to someone you trust implicitly, tell them exactly what is going on in your relationship & ask them to help you - whether that help is covering for you so you can go to therapy to work out what you want to do about your relationship going forward & give you tools to use if you decide to stay or go, or seeing a lawyer to help you work out a way to divorce your husband, or even just asking the person you trust to help you & the kids get away from him so you can organise everything while not being in his controlling environment.\n\nMy sister's marriage ended when their 9 year old daughter rang the police because she thought daddy was going to kill mummy. Don't let your situation escalate to this level, stop it before he decides to turn to physical abuse. My sister & her kids all have PTSD & other issues from living with the abuse for years, & it will continue to affect them for years to come - it's been 10 years since he was arrested & given a restraining order for them & they're still dealing with problems from those abusive years with him. I don't want to see another family have to go through anything like they've suffered if I can possibly help.\n\nI hope you find what steps you want to take next & that things improve for you all, whether that's together with your husband as he works on himself, or separately while you all work to heal.
