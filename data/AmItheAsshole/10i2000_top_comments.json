Don\u2019t accept your dad\u2019s car. He broke his promise to you, and if you let him buy you a car, he\u2019ll always hold it over you. You are obviously a hard worker. You don\u2019t need him.

He doesn't realize that you will never trust his word again. Of course it's impractical for a first-time driver to have an expensive new car, and it would be more sensible to get a used vehicle.

That\u2019s a big loss. During key developmental years, too. </p>\n\n<p>With that, and with all of the \u201cdeals\u201d in the past, how is OP supposed to trust their father moving forward? Seems like dad always has a way to explain how/ why he\u2019s right. Even if OP \u201cwins\u201d or fulfills every part of a deal. If that were my dad I would take this as a sign to not trust this person or go to this person for motivation; they\u2019re not interested in what I want and what\u2019s good for me. They\u2019re not interested in being fair and demonstrating honesty to me. They\u2019re only interested in what\u2019s brag-worthy and self serving for them, as a parent.</p>\n</div>",

I started emotionally distancing myself from her when I was around 13.  I knew that I didn't value the things she valued, and she didn't value the things I did.  I no longer cared what she thought, or expected pride or respect from her for the things I considered accomplishments.\n\nWhile my family isn't well off, it's definitely upper middle class... and so, while her opinions didn't matter to me anymore, and I didn't really talk to her, or go to her for advice or support, I did look at the things my older siblings got, and requested a similar level of financial support as they got.  (Including my college paid for, a used car at 16yo, cash towards my wedding, etc, meanwhile I talk to her mainly through e-mails, once or twice a month, and a phone call maybe every couple months, though usually I just talk to my dad, and I saw her less than once a year in my 20's, now that I have small children, we see her a couple times a year.  But basically all communication is logistics about visits, and birthday gifts for the kids, etc).\n\nOP's father is willing to buy him a used car.  Even though he has the money to do it himself, if he can get his father to buy him a used car, without having to jump through any more hoops, I would get him to pay for the car (why not?  OP pay think it means his dad \"won\", but really it just means OP keeps that money in the bank for another thing and another day, when he might want it more, like to move out earlier!).\n\nIf I were OP, I would look through some local car listings, either private, or from local dealers, and just text or e-mail (depending on what OP thinks the better method is, the listings to his dad.  If the dad wants to have a bonding chit chat about cars, OP can keep it to \"I sent you what I'm looking at, if they cost too much, tell me what my budget is and I will send you listing that match that budget.\"  End of discussion.  At some point OP might have to go look at them with his dad, but if the dad wants long car shopping sessions, OP should say he's busy practicing piano, and he just wants to look at cars he's already picked out, etc.\n\nYou can have an emotionally distant relationship with a parent, establish boundaries and hold to them, but also get everything out of your parent that you can.  OP is 17.  Besides a car, there's college tuition, possibly a deposit on a first apartment, some furniture, etc, that will help him get set up in life, and make a big difference in the next 10 years, that OP should 100% benefit from.\n\nJust because OP will get 0% of the emotional support he deserves, doesn't mean he should accept 0% of the financial support he could have.
