        "body": "Stealing top comment: u/Melodic_Macaroon_541 I would *not* let your sister see your child. Or if so, certainly not alone EVER. \n\nYour sister is unhinged. She wants to steal a 10 year old away from her family so she can have her and be a mom, basically. This is extremely unkind, even completely ignoring your feelings. This would be a terrible thing to do to your child and shows she either gave zero consideration to \"her\" daughter's feelings or is straight up delusional in her thinking. \n\nGiven this, she can't be trusted with your child. She can't be trusted for what she would say. And frankly, I wouldn't trust her not to kidnap the kid either. If she is allowed any alone time with your child (might your parents allow this since they're so off base here?) or even maybe not alone who knows what she will say. She could tell  your child lies to try to poision her against you. She could tell your child you stole her at birth, etc. (She's already pretty much saying you stole her life to you, when you have all the facts. What will she say to a kid she is trying to con?) She's also lied to your parents, so she's clearly a liar and not above lying to get what she wants. \n\nYour child is old enough if you haven't yet you need to have a talk with  her about her past. (I hope she knows you are her adopted mother?) Explain that bio mom/aunt didn't want to be a mom back then and put her up for adoption, which means asked if there was anyone who wanted a baby to make a family and would give baby a good home, etc. Explain the situation with your husband/her dad if you haven't. That he didn't know about her when she was born, but as soon as he found out when she was two, he rushed over to meet her and be her dad and etc. **In the age of social media and your sister lying and using family, there is a very good chance she will reach or speak to your daughter at some point and you need to have told her the WHOLE truth first.** \n\n**Then you need to warn your daughter about your sister wanting to take her back/away.** I know this sounds harsh, but she needs to know to never go anywhere with sister if she tires to pick her up from school or other places, etc. **And she needs to know that sister is a liar and is willing to lie to try and get her back.** Explain that she has already lied to grandma and grandpa about what you said, so you think she might lie to daughter too, and daughter should be careful and not trust things aunt/bio-mom tells her. That she should check anything aunt tells her with you and dad, and you guys promise to always be honest and answer all of her questions. \n\nI'm 100% serious. It is NOT NORMAL for your sister to ask for 10 year old to be ripped from her parents so she can keep her, like she's some sort of pet or toy rather then a person. Your sister has already shown to be a liar. Please please PLEASE get ahead of this and fill your daughter in. It will be a million times worse if she has to hear any of this from someone else then from you.",

Inherently there is nothing wrong with letting her know the truth at some point- it won't be easy, but adopted children often deal ok with that, seek a relationship of some sort with their bio parent(s), and still cleave to their adoptive parents.

I assume every story on here is made up, but some of them are just absurd. </p>\n\n<p>No mention from parents of either one being married? OP falling for the guy that knocked up her sister? Sister thinking you can just reclaim a kid that you gave up the rights to, 7 years later? OP and sister&#39;s fiance both just happen to be infertile.. not saying that&#39;s impossible for two people to be infertile, it just seems mighty convenient for this narrative. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, if this is real, my advice is for OP to move far away and never let sister know where they are at. Somebody that mentally unstable wanting your daughter is a terrifying thought to live with.</p>\n</div>",
