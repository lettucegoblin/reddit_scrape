She barges in without knocking, including when he\u2019s undressing.  If genders were reversed, imagine how upset everyone would be. \n\n2. She wakes him up through the night.  This is abuse.  Your son is falling behind on sleep and worried constantly of when his Mom Will come in next.  This will (and likely already has) affected his mental health and school work.\n\n3. She only cares about herself. Both you and your son have told her how distressing it is when she comes in unannounced, but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\n4. She throws a tantrum and gives the silent treatment when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants.  This is incredibly manipulative.\n\nYour wife is being selfish, entitled, and controlling.  This is abusive.  You need to protect your son.  I strongly recommend the following:\n\n1. Take your son out just the two of you.\n\n2. Tell him you love him, support him, and his safety is your priority.\n\n3. Tell him he can always come to you.\n\n4. Tell him that his mother is wrong about not respecting his privacy.\n\n5. Tell him how his mother reacted and how her giving the silent treatment is wrong, manipulative, and not how disagreements are settled.\n\n6. Ask him if he feels safe around his Mom, and if she has ever made him feel unsafe.  This should include comments about his body and unwanted touching. This is important because it\u2019s not normal for a parent to come into the room unannounced so late at night.\n\n7. Ask him how he is coping.\n\n8. Offer him counseling.  Your wife is causing stress and anxiety in your son.  I suspect more is going on here.\n\nStrongly consider individual and couple\u2019s counseling.  There is much more going on here.

What possible reason could she have? The reason is she&#39;s into control and suspects if she can&#39;t see your son whenever she wants, he&#39;s doing something wrong. </p>\n\n<p>You are right that your son is old enough to have his privacy be respected. Families do not barge into each other&#39;s rooms without knocking and waiting for permission. Being family is not an excuse for her behavior. Your son gets to keep his lock, you keep on supporting him and your wife can just learn to live with it. Possibly her not talking to either of you will be a blessing for awhile.</p>\n</div>",

For the sake of a literal basic human right to privacy, you could have definitely stepped up more.</p>\n\n<p>The wording of your question \u2018am I the asshole for saying I warned you\u2019.... yes. YTA for purposefully orchestrating an I Told You So moment just so you could say \u201cI told you so.\u201d that is separate from the issue of your sons privacy, which, obviously he deserves.

I never could do anything and I was afraid to change clothes. When we moved and I got a lock, i left that locked at all times.

Then said plainly that his son did exactly what he predicted. OP is giving his son room to grow and set boundaries, and still supporting him. He doesn&#39;t need to say that he is going to personally install a lock on his door. He just needs to state that he has no problem with it and that his wife should respect their sons privacy. There is nothing cowardly about not provoking the wife even further by being aggressive, or allowing the son to stand up for himself.</p>\n</div>",

They also had connections with the police and judges so they had everyone in their pockets. But before I cut off my whole family I told them no matter what I did as a kid doesn\u2019t mean I deserve to be treated like that. I was the maid, the babysitter, the gardener, and punching bag for my siblings for all of my teenage life. My punishment was supposed to be for like a year until I got better instead it never went away. So when I did get better I just reverted back to my bad behaviour because I wasn\u2019t getting unpunished. \n\nI also had a bed time all the way until I cut them off. I got tracked constantly, had to give up my devices, and I got my messages monitored. Nothing was private for me. I barely hung out with my friends. I missed out on a lot of shit my high school years. I didn\u2019t go to my first party until I was 19. I develop social anxiety along with just normal anxiety, depression, anger issues (im working on it all), and insomnia. My fianc\u00e9 has helped me wonderfully. I wouldn\u2019t be as sane or stable as I am right now with my fianc\u00e9 and his friends and family. I\u2019m since moved out of my home state and will never speak to my family ever again. I\u2019m a lot better, but Op\u2019s wife reminds me of my family without the severe abusive qualities.\n\nETA: thank you! I\u2019m way better and a functional human being. I didn\u2019t let what they did to me as a kid and teen affect my future.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My grandparents saw my father as god and try to excuse what he did because I fucked up a lot as kid and a teenager. They also had connections with the police and judges so they had everyone in their pockets. But before I cut off my whole family I told them no matter what I did as a kid doesn\u2019t mean I deserve to be treated like that. I was the maid, the babysitter, the gardener, and punching bag for my siblings for all of my teenage life. My punishment was supposed to be for like a year until I got better instead it never went away. So when I did get better I just reverted back to my bad behaviour because I wasn\u2019t getting unpunished. </p>\n\n<p>I also had a bed time all the way until I cut them off. I got tracked constantly, had to give up my devices, and I got my messages monitored. Nothing was private for me. I barely hung out with my friends.
