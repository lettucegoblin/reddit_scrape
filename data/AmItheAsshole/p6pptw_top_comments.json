A person who is serious about applying for a mortgage makes sure in the months and years that lead up to this that they have enough savings and that their credit is good. This means paying off any credit card debt and running numerous credit reports to ensure that nothing is amiss. \n\nHaving said that, as soon as he was denied the loan and it came out that his family member stole his credit card, red flags started to go up for me. In order to have the credit card, that person would need to reapply for credit in his name and have access to his social security number. You can\u2019t just find a closed credit card and reopen it; that\u2019s not how it works. More likely somebody had access to his documents, like his social security card, and opened this account. However, even then, if that person maxed out the credit card, he would probably find out sooner than later. It just boggles my mind that in 2 years prior to applying for a mortgage, he never once opened a new credit card or ran a credit check, where he would have found all of this out.\n\nWhat also was a red flag is that he was so adamant about protecting this individual. A normal response to being defrauded or stolen from, especially from a friend or family member, is anger. The emotions don\u2019t match the actions. He\u2019s so non-confrontational that he willing to pay thousands of dollars in debt that he didn\u2019t rack up, which could take years and just as long to fix his credit? Even if he didn\u2019t turn them into the police, he\u2019s not willing to even mention it? Yeah, not adding up.\n\nYou want to know what I think? I think he lied to you. He either lent the family member his credit card and/or money and never told you or he\u2019s covering up an impulsive shopping, gambling, or alcohol issue.

Sorry 2 months in a relationship, maybe 10 dates total during that time, is not a \u201cBorrow a couple of bucks, 200 at least\u201d situation.\n\nHe said, no problem totally understand and then informed he would take a pay day loan instead. Red flag 2 if anyone is counting.\n\nThen, he wanted to go out to dinner and said he would pay using a credit card. Red flag 3.\n\nI asked him how m8uch debt he was in and he looked at me strange. He never bothered to figure it out.  So, I made dinner and we sat down in front of the computer to figure out his debt. \n\n24, 200K in the hole. Can you imagine?\n\n2 new Cars crashed 1 still owed money on it, College (Community/State Asoc. & Bachelor), where he filled out a credit card application in the quad and then went on ski trips, spring break, frat night pizza party, drinks with friends, you see the picture. And, his credit rating was so far down the rabbit hole he would never qualify for a Loan. He didn\u2019t even seem shocked. Said, when one credit card is maxed out he would just open another and move on. Oh and that time his car got repossessed was easy to fix. He just went down to the yard and paid them with a credit card. Also, he made about 30k a year if he was lucky. \n\nThat\u2019s when a saw the entire parade of red flags all doing a jig and well, I dumped him the next day. \n\nSomeone who doesn\u2019t understand debt and the issues it will bring to your life is not going to help you. I had a future I wanted. Not pay day loans , new credit card bills with my name on it and occasional trips to the repo yard. \n\nAfter a month. I started getting credit card applications in my mail box. Apparently he had applied for them in my name, so he could get points and awards for signing me up. Oh brother\u2026. I froze my credit on the spot. Just in case he was planning to open a card in my name and just run up the bill.  \n\nMY advice to you is freeze your credit or invest in a security system for your credit, call your credit card company and bank order new cards. Make sure they know you might have a problem then they can send it signature only on delivery. Keep a close eye on your accounts. Double verify your online shopping accounts too like Amazon. Require a pin on all your cash apps like Venmo and such.\n\nBe diligent! Glad you broke up with your boyfriend. Smart move. \n\nOh if anyone wonders what happen to my Ex. Married a really nice but so ni\u00e9ve girl. She was my neighbor, I was friendly with her mom, daughter was about 3 years younger than me. I really liked her, so sweet. They must have met when he would come over. I don\u2019t know? I only heard they got married after she had her first kid. They, uhm invited me to the shower so I would buy them a gift. I moved just after I ended things with him and honestly, I never looked back. My time in that state was done. I uhm, never sent a gift. Haha. \n\nHer mom contacted me on the book of faces about 5 years ago. He and She  have 3 kids now live in Mom\u2019s  basement. Mom Asked me if I can give her daughter a job at my company because he was on disability and couldn\u2019t work. They live three states away from me now. Her thinking was I would hire her, he could keep his disability, and my company would help them move so she could sell the house. (Which, she told me they wanted to live in rent free after she moved to Florida). \n\nPass mom, sorry. They wouldn\u2019t pass the background check. Mom ended up never moving to Florida. Died 3 yrs back. House went into foreclosure before she died. Don\u2019t know what happened to them after that. \n\n\nYou dodged a bullet. Good for you",

My dad had put in a request for a loan to finance a motorcycle, and it was denied due to poor credit. My parents were floored; this was before all the free credit check websites but they had no clue what would be causing their credit to be poor enough to be denied a 5k loan. Turns out my uncle (dad\u2019s brother) had forged my dad\u2019s signature as the co-signer on a loan a couple years\u2019 prior and then defaulted on it. It was a huge mess to get it off my dad\u2019s credit, my grandparent\u2019s were unhappy that this could harm my uncle, etc. It took a year to get it off, and then every three years or so the original loan would be sold to a new company, who would then come after my parents for the debt and they\u2019d have to re-prove this was fraudulent.\n\nIn all honesty we were lucky my dad caught this when he was trying to finance a motorcycle, because we had always planned on moving to a better area before I started high school so I could get a better education. If he hadn\u2019t caught the fraud before applying for a home loan, it could have completely ruined our plans to move, and my future! The whole thing quite frankly made me despise my uncle, and it also affected my relationship with my paternal grandparents. I\u2019m still struggling with this today.",

I had never been on my own, I had never lived alone, and I had no idea who the hell I was. \n\nIt took some time getting used to living on my own, and figuring out who I was and what I liked, but once I did, It was AMAZING!!! I figured out what I want in a relationship, and what is acceptable. I realized how I want and deserve to be treated in a relationship. I also figured out things that are absolutely unacceptable in a relationship and that I will never ever put up with or allow to happen to me again! Just knowing those things, and having those \"ground rules\" set were life changing.. \n\nIt's been many years since then, and even though I swore I would never get married again because going through what I did just broke me too much, I have been happily married for the last 10 years to a very wonderful man who treats me amazingly!! (He also went through a shitty marraige and divorce and had the same \"ground rules\" as I did for the most part.)\n\nGive yourself plenty of time, space and patience. It may be scary right now, you may be hurting, and it may seem like there's no end in sight, but one day soon it will all be just a bittersweet memory. \u2764",
