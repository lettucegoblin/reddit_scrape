Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI know this sounds bad, but hear me out. im using a throwaway cuz my wife uses reddit, so please don't upvote this. I just want honest feedback.\n\nMy wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we've been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. \n\nAnd it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm \"useless\". \n\nThis all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.\n\nShe got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just want honest feedback.</p>\n\n<p>My wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we&#39;ve been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I&#39;m a plumber, she&#39;s an engineer) so I think we&#39;re putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. </p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly).

Let&#39;s look at the chore break down:</p>\n\n<p>Her - cooking breakfast : 45 minutes</p>\n\n<pre><code>      Cleaning up from breakfast: 30 mins \n\n      Cooking lunch : 45 minutes\n\n      Cleaning from lunch :30 mins\n\n       Cooking dinner : 1 hour\n\n       Cleaning from dinner : 30 minutes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You - loading the washer : 3 minutes\n            Loading the dryer : 2 minutes</p>\n\n<pre><code>         Folding : 25 minutes\n\n         Throwing away trash : 3 minutes\n\n         Mowing the lawn : 1 hour\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So please, tell us again how it&#39;s even? Because so didn&#39;t even put the time she spends breastfeeding, watching the children while you game and all the other chores you skirt around.  She&#39;s pregnant, she&#39;s exhausted. Let her eat a damn meatloaf</p>\n</div>",

Guess what, when the kids go to bed and your wife doesn\u2019t need your help with anything, THEN you can play video games.

When you carry a child for nearly 10 months, deal with all the pains and ailments that come along with being pregnant and then birth a human being out of your vagina or have major surgery to remove the child from your freaking gut then you can say you\u2019re pregnant.

Having three kids with a fourth on the way has to be utterly exhausting for BOTH of you. And no doubt you have to deal with a lot. Obviously you would want some time to yourself, you want to feel noticed with how much you do. I understand that as much as I can. I think the only reason YTA is because you are making the case that the suffering is 50/50, and that's just not the case. \n\nYour wife sounds like she is going through utter hell right now my friend. Not only is she going the ringer from this pregnancy, it sounds like she is still carrying the responsibilities of being a wife too. That's A LOT to have to deal with man. And her seeing you play video games; getting a chance at the rest she desperately yearns for, doesn't help. Just really think about her situation right now; put yourself in her shoes! You know why God made us men? Cause we couldn't handle being women lol. How bad it feels for you? Just imagine carrying another life in your stomach. I promise you man, it's so much harder for her.\n\nI hope you guys work through this. This is the part of marriage that makes the vows you say before one another necessary. It's the dark, messy time. Hopefully you guys can reconnect in each other's pain, and learn how to work through it with compromise and love. Remember, she's still the woman you couldn't wait to marry. Good luck buddy.",

You're both too stressed out.\n\nIf you're doing so financially well then you should really look into hiring a helper/nanny type person to help out during the evenings so each of you get more time.\n\nYou're the asshole for \"dealing with\" her puking, which is very crass of you.\n\nYou're not the asshole for getting annoyed with her constant demands. Pregnant or not, that can be annoying, and pregnant women can sometimes use their pregnancy as an excuse to be overly demanding and selfish. Still, I don't know just HOW demanding she's being, so I would say pregnancy is difficult, and more so for some than others, so she may be having a very difficult time and you should try to empathise with her more.\n\nNon-physical jobs can also be exhausting, even if just mentally. I work a mentally exhausting job and sometimes my mind is just a glob of blob after a day of work. But I don't fault you for also being exhausted after a hard, physically demanding day.\n\nThe chores sound fairly even to me even though hers are more day in-day out chores. I absolutely hate mowing the lawn, hate hate hate it, and it can be so miserable on hot and sunny days, and also on cold and rainy days, and it can be exhausting and time consuming. There's a reason she agreed to this division of labour and it's probably because she also hates the idea of mowing the lawn and taking out the garbage and stuff. And if she has a dishwasher, dishes are fairly easy even for a house full of kids, so it's really the cooking she's stuck with, and honestly I can understand getting frustrated after working all day and getting the same easy meal again for the third time in a week. But it's really boiling down to that you are BOTH overloaded here with work and kids and pregnancy.\n\nThe MIL sounds like a pain in the ass, and if she is saying that stuff around you and your wife, or even your kids too, then that needs to stop. You should say something, but also, your wife should say something, and if she hasn't then I feel like your wife isn't supporting you enough with your MIL.\n\nI completely think it's okay to want an hour to play video games each day. Everyone needs unwinding and relaxing time, and I'm sure your wife also gets some too to watch tv or read a book or whatever. Now if she doesn't, then it is selfish of you. But you should really BOTH be working to BOTH have some alone time each day. There should be an hour where you watch all the kids and an hour where she does so you each get uninterrupted time. Again, this is where a nanny/helper can come in if you can afford it.\n\nYour wife is an asshole for dealing with wanting you to help by screaming \"Get off your ass\".\n\nYou're not an asshole for saying you're both pregnant in a general sense since many couples do refer to it as both being pregnant, especially if you're doing extra stuff to help your wife like as you say she asks you to go do stuff for her all the time now. However, it gets iffy when you say that you're both pregnant because you work a lot more hours. I think a major problem is how you're choosing to word a lot of your feelings.\n\nYou should both apologise to each other, both work on empathising with each other more, and both work to help each other and give each other some alone/relaxing time.",

He'd probably mow, too, if my yard was big enough to bother, as is, I just weed eat a few times a month while gardening.\n\nThat 14yo is the oldest of 4, actually, which is the number you're about to have. He, obviously, does school for a good portion of the day. He'll watch his younger siblings while I cook if their dad isn't home. Hell, some days he'll do a good chunk of the cooking as I think it's an important life skill kids should learn, so when they're all grown up they can, ya know, feed themselves and their family tasty food instead of whining about their SOs meatloaf.\n\nSo, long way around to say: what you want props for doing, and are using to claim pregnancy affects you as much as your wife... Are within the realm of normal chores and responsibilities for a teenager. They're nothin' special or notable, just the minimum for being a productive member of a household. \n\nYea, she wakes you up because she's puking. Puking daily probably has something to do with requesting special snacks, too. If she thinks it sounds good or will stay down, she wants to try. She asked you to set up a foot bath? Horrible, just completely over the line! I assume you never ask her for favors? To grab you a soda while playing video games, maybe? Track down the keys you misplaced? Keep an eye out for your favorite shirt? Stop an extra place because you need batteries? None of that?",

Oh and the one other person who helps you with the children is horrible and I dont want her in the house so you can&#39;t take your <em>well deserved</em> break. Even though I need my game time hour every day. BTW the meals have been repetitive and lackluster even though it&#39;s like &#39;the only thing you do&#39;. Omg why are you mad? What did I say? You&#39;re over reacting!&quot;</p>\n</div>",

However my husband is a gem compared to OP. He ordered pedicure supplies so he could surprise me with a pedicure, he\u2019s massage my back every night, he cooked the entirety of my pregnancy. Now that I have been in bed for two weeks (due to the stitches, can\u2019t walk properly), he has been doing all the cleaning, cooking and most of the diapers changes. \n\nYTA OP, yes you have a child together but you are most definitely NOT pregnant together. You better do everything to apologize to your wife.\n\nEdit: also like to point out that OP\u2019s chores aren\u2019t daily chores  (except for laundry maybe, depending on when they do this) whereas wife is cooking and doing dishes daily for 5 people... \nseems fair /s",
