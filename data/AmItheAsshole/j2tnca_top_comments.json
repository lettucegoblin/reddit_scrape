When my grandma died a few years ago, I was given her engagement ring that she wore for the first 50 years (grandpa upgraded it for their 50th). It was very sentimental to her, even though it wasn't the biggest diamond or anything (it's like .25 carat). Moreover, my grandpa had bought it for his hometown sweetheart before he left for the military, and met my grandma a few months later. He wrote and asked for the ring back the night he met my grandma, and proposed to grandma less than a month later with the same ring, yet it was incredibly special to her even though it was a \"hand-me-down.\"\n\nAll that having been said, I can definitely understand wanting something personal. Aesthetics can be important, and the significance of being intended for you from the start can be important. My now-wife (who was overwhelmed at receiving said hand-me-down engagement ring) wanted me to wear the wedding band she bought a previous fiance, who was a total d-bag and abusive. Personally, I don't mind second-hand objects, but that specific ring was forever going to be associated with this very negative memory of her ex, so I politely declined (and instead I wear a family heirloom as well).\n\nLast, but not least, I think if you want to have a unique ring, it's worth it to suggest a cheap option. There is a post on reddit somewhere about industry secrets, and a jeweler left a comment saying that a synthetic white sapphire is identical to a diamond unless you've got one of those special magnifying glass things and know specifically what to look for, but they tend to cost much less (I think at the time they quoted something like ~$150 for a 1 carat diamond equivalent). That could be a much better option, especially if someone can't afford much. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Plus the whole diamond engagement ring \"tradition\" was an ad campaign that lied to us about it being historical tradition and we just accept it as fact, so we should really consider moving past it already!**",

But because he put thought into it for me because he knows how much I love wearing my rings (luckily I could adjust my engagement ring ... it's not a huge, expensive ring, but he picked it FOR ME to wear forever). They're a symbol of our marriage. When he was wedding ring shopping originally, he was showing them to my sister and she knew the ones he was looking at were too big/too intricate (my style is much simpler) and she pointed that out to him and he was like, \"hey, you're right, I should have known that\" and got me something simple because he knew that's what I would want.

He just wanted to be married/engaged (he pushed me to move in/get engaged super quick, but while I did live with him briefly, I refused to get engaged) until he got tired of one person and wanted to move on.

And I was like, &quot;yup, he&#39;s gonna be shit-talking me too after I drop him.&quot; And I&#39;m sure he did. He just wanted to be married/engaged (he pushed me to move in/get engaged super quick, but while I did live with him briefly, I refused to get engaged) until he got tired of one person and wanted to move on. &#39;Twas bizarre. I heard he got married and divorced at least once more before he moved out of state and I never heard what happened after that.</p>\n</div>",

And he\u2019s always refused.\nAnd I\u2019ve gone to so many movies I had no interest in seeing just because it was time with him and I wanted to share his interests with him. \n\nAnd for some reason that more than any of the other far more serious red flags and borderline abusive behaviors I came to see, upsets me the most.

Radio silence. And over that time I had the time to think and reflect, and all the separate pieces fell into place that all pointed to how our relationship catered to and centered around him entirely with my needs never taken into account. </p>\n\n<p>The dumbest and most trivial one of all of them- but the one that actually upsets me the most the more I think about it - was the realization that in the entire year+ that we\u2019ve been together, and all of the things I\u2019ve done for him...I\u2019ve asked for exactly one thing. One. \nAll I ever asked for was for him to watch a Harry Potter movie with me. He\u2019s never seen them (he\u2019s a Star Wars and Lord of the Rings guy). He knows I love them. And it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been trying to get him to let me share with him. And he\u2019s always refused.\nAnd I\u2019ve gone to so many movies I had no interest in seeing just because it was time with him and I wanted to share his interests with him. </p>\n\n<p>And for some reason that more than any of the other far more serious red flags and borderline abusive behaviors I came to see, upsets me the most. How the only thing I\u2019ve ever asked for was denied because it wasn\u2019t par to his preferences or interests. Regardless of my own. </p>\n\n<p>You dodged a bullet OP. There\u2019s better out there for you. And for me.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you guys all for the support and sharing your stories! You\u2019re all amazing and strong and you all deserve to be treated like queens!</p>\n</div>",
