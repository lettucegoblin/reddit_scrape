Maybe don\u2019t go out to a restaurant....or if you do, don\u2019t ditch her. She most definitely needs your love, help & support. The human body is absolutely incredible and complicated. If this just started, she probably has no idea what the hell is going on.

Nothing really changed my mind except that stranger things have happened. \n\nOP, consider that your wife may be struggling with PPD without necessarily realizing it. There comes a point in sleep deprivation where just about anything goes, but for the most part I\u2019m assuming that you both are a little past the very very newborn phase, as both of you are going out on dates and find yourself in positions without your child from time to time. Either way, at this point I have to point out that leaving your wife stranded at a restaurant probably made her feel very embarrassed and much worse. It\u2019s an extremely disheartening thing for your partner to seemingly give up on you in any situation, and it causes far more issues than necessary. For this, you\u2019re an asshole and you need to apologize to your wife.\n\nBut I cannot stress enough how abnormal her behavior is. It\u2019s concerning to the point where it would be encouraged that undergo a psychological evaluation if it persists through even mild therapy. It sounds to me like stress and being away from the rest of the world for the majority of time is starting to take a serious toll on her. Right now the only indicator may be the baby talk all of the time, but it could develop into more noticeable symptoms such as severe anxiety. *To me the baby talk is a sign of dissociation*, which is usually prompted by different types of depression. She needs to understand that it\u2019s not normal and that if she really can\u2019t attempt to control it and dial it back, that she needs to entertain speaking with a professional. \n\nI think it\u2019s stress related, and moreso a product of being submerged into a world of just you and a baby. It sounds like she\u2019s having trouble separating herself from her own world that she\u2019s been working in for months, and stepping back to reality and other societal norms. I don\u2019t think there is anything seriously or permanently wrong with your wife, but she may be on the verge of a mental breakdown which I would take very seriously. \n\nIn addition to considering a therapist at the least, I would encourage both of you to work on your communication with each other, and for you to try and be as understanding and helpful as possible in this unusual and difficult time for her (and you). \n\nGood luck OP, and I hope things get a little better soon.",

It's so easy to just step in and say something like \"Look I know you don't think this is serious, but it's something that's actually really bothering me, so I'd appreciate if we could seriously talk about this\". At that point if they won't talk, then it's way beyond just 'laughing it off' and into straight up ignoring your partner.\n\nInstead he seems to have just backed down at the slightest hint of resistance and then just let the issue stew inside him until he snapped. How is the wife supposed to know this is a serious issue for him if he didn't follow up? From her point of view, he raised something, she assured him it was nothing serious and he accepted that.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that communication is way more than just ticking a box that you have literally mentioned your issue once, it's about actually ensuring your partner understands what is bothering you, why it's bothering you, and how much it's bothering you.",

It&#39;s so easy to just step in and say something like &quot;Look I know you don&#39;t think this is serious, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s actually really bothering me, so I&#39;d appreciate if we could seriously talk about this&quot;. At that point if they won&#39;t talk, then it&#39;s way beyond just &#39;laughing it off&#39; and into straight up ignoring your partner.</p>\n\n<p>Instead he seems to have just backed down at the slightest hint of resistance and then just let the issue stew inside him until he snapped.
