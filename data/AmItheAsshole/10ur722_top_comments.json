She only cares about how bad she's going to look, having only having half the class go on a trip that should be fun for everyone and that everyone should want to go to! She also will probably have to explain why only half the kids are going when it's a water park! Explaining the situation will make her look bad, and she's only worried about that. Seeing as she's making repeat offenses of mistreating the children and ruining their fun, particularly your daughter's, I wouldn't trust her to lie about the reason half the kids aren't going and believe whatever lie she says just because she's a teacher. For this reason, I'd just tell the people about her everything that she's done. Your daughter isn't going to be the only one she does this to. So, while the other kids might miss out, I consider this to be far from petty. By not going and putting her in the hot seat, she's more likely to get called on the nonsense she's pulling. That means she'll be watched better or something else that hopefully keeps other kids from getting bullied by her. If you let it go, then she won't change. Just continue to bully her other students in the future. \n\n\nI could get if it was a buddy system thing and purely for safety. But they should get to choose their buddy and it should be a fun time. Not a forced thing that ruins your fun and reputation (and I know it's not his fault if he's deemed the \"weird\" kid because kids are super mean. But all the same, generally, people who hang out with the \"weird\" kid then become \"weird\" kids themselves. It's totally unfair, but she shouldn't put kids in that position) They're also 8 year olds who are almost 9, 9 year olds, and 10 year olds, I'd guess. The buddy should ultimately be a teacher since they simply won't break off into groups where they could get lost if their teachers are doing their jobs properly. Your husband is wrong about her feeling bad. If she did, she'd have seen your daughter was unhappy and made changes since it's supposed to be a fun event. You've also already paid your VIP tickets, and you probably bought yourself and / or your husband a ticket for the day. So, to have her go on the field trip now would mean you pay more. Especially if either of you called off work for the trip. Then you miss the income regardless of if you let her go with the class or you or your husband. I get the other's might not get to go, but the only one who should feel guilty but doesn't is the teacher. If she'd not have done that or had fixed the situation when it was brought to her attention, then none of this would have happened. So it's not your fault if they don't go. You're the hero if you stick to your guns in my opinion as you'd force her to face the consequences of her actions. She probably will never do anything like this to your daughter again, and she's less likely to have a chance to bully other students! Pat yourself on the back, stick to your guns on this, and hopefully your husband will understand that this isn't petty, but the bigger picture",

In gym class, I was often paired to work with those girls because no one else wanted to work with them. The teacher knew who my mom was and knew that I would be understanding.

Your daughter isn't responsible for being a teacher or a caregiver for other students. And she shouldn't feel bad because she doesn't want to. At the same time, as she ages it's important to make sure she understands to treat students who are different or have different abilities in school with care and compassion. Not saying that didn't happen here, but it could be an important additional lesson down the line.",

Totally agree, NTA, and I hope that OP sticks to her guns on this one and decides to keep the VIP tickets and use those.

That way they know this isn't an isolated incident and so she can't lie about the reason why. Because if she lies, in my experience, they believe the teacher. I wouldn't leave that to chance",

        "body": "I really wish I had realised what was happening when teachers did this to me. I was the unhealthily-compliant, ultra-quiet, good-grades kid that teachers never had to worry about. In many classes, I was put next to the \"bad kids\". \n\nThere were two types: the pseudo \"bad kids\" who actually just had poorly managed ADHD and needed meds and management strategies, not an emotional support desk partner; and the *actually* bad kids who were straight up fucking bullies. The latter misbehaved in class not because they were bored and had attention issues, they misbehaved because they were inconsiderate of other students and had no concern for consequences, and this showed up in how they treated others.\n\nI was unfortunately often sat next to the second type, and it made my own learning very difficult and really knocked my self esteem. One of these kids ended up turning into my bully that year, and sitting next to her in those classes made me dread school. In between being disruptive, she'd sabotage my projects, make comments about my early-blooming body, and try to get me in trouble with the teacher and other students by trying to engage me in conversations that were inappropriate. I was scolded for talking in class when I was really trying to get the disruptive kid to shut the actual fuck up. \n\nShe was absolutely awful to everyone who had to sit with her, and her favourite thing to do was to sabotage your work and get you in trouble with the teacher. She'd make it hard to hear instructions, and then would deliberately give you the wrong ones so that you'd do your assignments incorrectly.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I really wish I had realised what was happening when teachers did this to me. I was the unhealthily-compliant, ultra-quiet, good-grades kid that teachers never had to worry about. In many classes, I was put next to the &quot;bad kids&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>There were two types: the pseudo &quot;bad kids&quot; who actually just had poorly managed ADHD and needed meds and management strategies, not an emotional support desk partner; and the <em>actually</em> bad kids who were straight up fucking bullies. The latter misbehaved in class not because they were bored and had attention issues, they misbehaved because they were inconsiderate of other students and had no concern for consequences, and this showed up in how they treated others.</p>\n\n<p>I was unfortunately often sat next to the second type, and it made my own learning very difficult and really knocked my self esteem. One of these kids ended up turning into my bully that year, and sitting next to her in those classes made me dread school. In between being disruptive, she&#39;d sabotage my projects, make comments about my early-blooming body, and try to get me in trouble with the teacher and other students by trying to engage me in conversations that were inappropriate. I was scolded for talking in class when I was really trying to get the disruptive kid to shut the actual fuck up. </p>\n\n<p>She was absolutely awful to everyone who had to sit with her, and her favourite thing to do was to sabotage your work and get you in trouble with the teacher. She&#39;d make it hard to hear instructions, and then would deliberately give you the wrong ones so that you&#39;d do your assignments incorrectly. Sometimes, she&#39;d do it by just gaslight the poor kid/s sitting next to her. She once stole my project the day it was due, and I&#39;m lucky that was the only occasion I&#39;d ever handed in something late for that class \u2014 the teacher was lenient because my track record was good, but I would&#39;ve been in trouble otherwise.

So I did a little math, and realized that I could get a zero on this assignment and still get an A+ for the year.  </p>\n\n<p>So I have them a taste of their own medicine, and refused to do a damn thing.

Eventually, I had to be seated away from EVERYONE, and I was content to disassociate and melt crayons on the radiators, or read in the reading corner. They even sent me to the Principal's office during religion time (I went to a Catholic school in Boston). It made all the kids think I was being punished for blasphemy when really I was getting a 1:1 class with a nun who LOVED having a child that could debate Merton and Aquinas with her. I wasn't the easiest student, but I was a rewarding challenge.   \nIn high school, I did end up taking on the \"mom\" role for my group of trouble makers.

Eventually, I had to be seated away from EVERYONE, and I was content to disassociate and melt crayons on the radiators, or read in the reading corner. They even sent me to the Principal&#39;s office during religion time (I went to a Catholic school in Boston). It made all the kids think I was being punished for blasphemy when really I was getting a 1:1 class with a nun who LOVED having a child that could debate Merton and Aquinas with her. I wasn&#39;t the easiest student, but I was a rewarding challenge.<br/>\nIn high school, I did end up taking on the &quot;mom&quot; role for my group of trouble makers.

Not a single teacher even asked me why I sat alone, until I realized they saw me as an opportunity. They collectively decided that any kids who acted out during lunch got one warning before they had to sit with me. I'm not talking about one teacher. They all took turns monitoring lunch. They all treated me the same.\n\nThe kids that sat with me, after the initial agitation of being punished, usually had a nice lunch, but never invited me to sit with them or their friends the next day. Even after years of therapy I still can't eat comfortably (if at all) in a school cafeteria-like setting, but at least I don't relive it when I remember it now. It also damaged my trust in teachers.

Those children often grow up into adults doing the same thing - doing whatever anyone else decides is more important than their own needs, fearing that they are a bad person if ever they want to place boundaries or put themselves first before others. They are not the parents of their classmates nor are they teachers. Let the children be children.",

He basically gave us the textbook, a suggested timetable for the entire year, some exercises, and said \"hop to it, help each other first, come to me if you need, if you all want help on a topic I'll run a lesson on it\". He still helped set up and run the required practical experiments that made up part of the grade, but he took a step back from teaching into more supporting.\n\nHelping took on a very different dimension when it was a class of 20 who had all very deliberately chosen to be there, there was a cadre of us who were quite fast and it was much more manageable that we'd either *voluntarily* buddy up with someone who was struggling more or we'd help out the ones we really didn't like as a group or even just straight up ignored them when they were being real arseholes. Like I would breeze through a chapter we were supposed to take 6 hours of lesson time on in 1 hour then probably spend another hour or two hanging out helping a really good friend who struggled a lot (he's now in pro musical theatre, he just wanted a qualification with more academic gravitas than Music and Music Technology). Another hour doing exercises and then the rest either reading ahead or being part of the group explaining the basics again to a guy who both struggled with the content and was a bit of an arsehole to the people he asked for help.\n\nI think this approach might have helped dilute the parentification, especially as the teacher was genuinely still alert and present, like he was keeping good notes on what was happening and caught up with us 1-on-1 in class time to check in on how it was working, and delivered the goods when asked for help, plus we were all 16-18. I found it memorable, not sure it helped me in an particular way as I was already a straight-A\\* student but the class overall did pretty well that year and his method ended up in an industry magazine iirc.\n\nI think he just liked not having to do as much prep.",

A boy in my class was a fumbling, bumbling hot mess who irritated our young teacher so much she told him he needed a babysitter & assigned me to the job. I\u2019m a special education teacher now and wonder what his issues were. ADHD for starters. Back when I was in elementary school, it was called \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d. \nI was so embarrassed, for Joey and myself, but I never told my mother.
