You can\u2019t let her continue to effect the sleep and health of the rest of the household like this or in a few years she\u2019ll be the subject of someone else\u2019s AITA post \u201cI took my roommates bedroom door off because she slams it 20x a day, AITA?\u201d</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;m usually not a fan of doors being removed as punishment because most of the time the punishment doesn&#39;t fit the crime and the purposeful lack of privacy (I&#39;ve seen parents even take the door off of teens <em>bathrooms</em>) is gross and usually is a form of emotional abuse. However, she was definitely slamming the door on purpose. Next thing you need to do is get her some professional help.
