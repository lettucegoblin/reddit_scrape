Did you tell SILs that you are sorry they have no personality beyond being a mother and you&#39;d try to buy them one next Christmas? Did you tell MIL that if she is so excited about being a grandmother she better start showing a little respect to her grandchildren&#39;s mother? Did you tell your husband you did not want to hear another damned word about it until he returned all his gifts, gave you the money, and took total responsibility for the girls for a day while you went and spent it on something you like? </p>\n\n<p>No? Then you have nothing to apologize for. And you are not at a stalemate; your husband has asked you to do something you are not going to do. That&#39;s fine. Because this is not going to stop. They are going to keep calling you &quot;mama&quot; and buying you mother-themed gifts, deliberately to annoy you now. I bet everything they buy you is pink, too, isn&#39;t it? </p>\n\n<p>I think you are just going to have to call everyone in your husband&#39;s family Mommy or Daddy from now on. Including your husband. In public. In front of his friends. And buy matching shirts for him and the girls. Pink ones.</p>\n</div>",

I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don\u2019t get to be my own person. I\u2019m just mommy.\n\nHusband doesn\u2019t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! \n\nAnd like matching outfits. I don\u2019t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I\u2019m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they\u2019re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?\n\nFrom the time we got to the in-laws, it was \u201cmama\u201d this and \u201cmama\u201d that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said \u201cYou know my name is (Carmen), right?\u201d she just looked at me funny and said \u201cOf course, silly?\u201d I said \u201cSo why do you keep calling me \u201cmama\u201d? You aren\u2019t going around calling (husband) papa?\u201d SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like \u201cUm, okay.\u201d \n\nThis went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? \n\nAt that point I was just like \u201cDo you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?\u201d\n\nThe same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said \u201cBut you\u2019re such a good mama!\u201d\n\nI said that I\u2019m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys get him anything that says  \u201cpapa\u201d? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?\u201d\n\nMIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just \u201cso excited\u201d about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.\n\nI was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole \u201cAre you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn\u2019t healthy\u201d faux concern thing that\u2019s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.\n\nThe other one was angry and saying that \u201cis being a mom somehow beneath you\u201d and \u201cdo you think you\u2019re better than the rest of us?\u201d and all that.\n\nWhen we finally left, he asked me why I\u2019d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven\u2019t. No one listened to me before. I\u2019ve said these things plenty of times. I\u2019ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I\u2019d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.\n\nI said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. \n\nWe\u2019re at a stalemate.

They probably just know your husband better and don&#39;t know you that well so they go for what they see as &quot;safe&quot; gifts. It was completely within your right to confront (nicely and calmly) your MIL about how they refer to you and the gifts. It was not acceptable for your second SIL to be rude.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot know your relationship to your MIL, but if you can (and it isn&#39;t to the detriment to your mental health), I would recommend trying to form your own special relationship with your MIL distinct from just being her son&#39;s wife.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n</div>",

Not that bright, content to sit in one of the several recliners but not watch the game FIL and son-in-law and my (now-ex) husband were watching. She thought I was going to sit and whisper with her about the best hair spray or nail polish, but f*#k that. What to do?  She\u2019d already alphabetized the spices and arranged objects symmetrically on the windowsill in the kitchen. (I\u2019m not making this up.)\nIt was a gorgeous day outside, I invited her to go for a walk (no!) so I went. And then got my book and read on the patio. She came out and said, \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d  I said \u201cYes, I just can\u2019t sit inside on a beautiful day like this.\u201d  We took her out for a birthday dinner and I gave her a book of interviews of famous women, one of whom was the wife of their governor. I\u2019d heard lots of talk from MIL and FIL about this couple and thought she be interested. Nope. She said she doesn\u2019t like that lady & it\u2019s going right in the trash. How lovely. When a cousin told me & hubby how lucky we are that the in-laws accept our children (because they\u2019re adopted & multi-ethnic), I was ready to head home. The whole point of this long story, is that a nice MIL is a beautiful thing to be treasured!  Tell her you appreciate her understanding and her explanation and how happy she is about your kids and be generous with gifts. I love the idea of calling the SILs SIL and giving them mommy crap. Ooh, there are LOTS of books about how to get your kids to behave. If you need to differentiate between them, they can be \u201cOld SIL\u201d and \u201cYoung SIL\u201d or if one is heavier, she can be \u201cBig SIL\u201d and the other can be \u201cLittle SIL\u201d  You can have some fun with those girls!",

In my case, I think my greatest personal achievement in recent years has been my doctoral thesis: objectively, let's say that it is not the greatest piece of scholarship that has ever been written, but compared to anything else I have done it is the thing I am most proud of. It would be sad and concerning if I made that thesis everything that I am. I understand that a kid is a much bigger thing than a thesis and so maybe the comparison does not work, but still I think that I can agree with a person who believes that raising their child is the hardest but most rewarding thing they have ever done and their most important legacy, but not with someone who sees themselves only as a parent.
