Take the advice on here with a grain of salt coming from people who have their own baggage. \n\nThere's multiple dynamics I see that are possible but unknown:\n\n\\- Levi's 'hothead' is likely not for without reason, probably a reaction to seeing his parents being split and being pissed that another man (not his 'real' dad) being with his mom\n\n\\- Incongruent punishment between you, your wife, and his real dad is very dangerous and extremely unhealthy for emotional development. He will likely develop some impulse controls as he gets older if not already (well, I guess throwing books in the water as an example). If he doesn't get his way, he knows he can go to another dad who will give him what he wants. This is not good.\n\n\\- He may feel left out of the family and gets along naturally better with his dad. Do you spend time with him, or try to? This could be attention seeking behaviour on his part. I see this as something especially when Susan refused something (he feels excluded from the family) to borrow - would Susan allow another sibling (if there is another one) to borrow the camera?\n\n\\- You speak highly of Susan but nothing of Levi. This is a problem as you may left out some important positive qualities he has and are likely painting him in black and white. You spoke a lot about how Susan is an avid reader and how proud you are of her (or insinuated that), but what about Levi?\n\n\\- Levi's real dad is likely getting back at his wife via Levi and allowing him to do what he wants. Trust me, I grew up in a similar situation and have seen these crazy dynamics.\n\n\\- Your wife as others have mentioned, is unable to discipline her son, however discipline is a two-person job and in this case, MUST be a three person job. It literally requires ALL of you to agree on set punishments. You have to find an agreement with his dad that he agrees on.\n\n\\- If Levi refuses to follow the rules of the house, I think it's fair to let him stay with his dad for some time. I'm not surprised his dad basically said no though, he does not want the responsibility likely.\n\nYour options:\n\n\\- As mentioned, try to convince Levi's dad to join you and your wife for systems counselling.\n\n\\- If not, is there a mutual respected third party you can have mediate? An elder perhaps?\n\n\\- I think someone mentioned divorce, and it got upvoted to 7.3k times. This is crazy how knee-jerk people are to me, divorce should really be a last option. Try to see if there is a way to work things out. You have to be intelligent about this.\n\n\\- Try online systems counselling? Betterhelp is reasonably priced.

I would say no, because Male Lions like to eat the young of other males.  Your wife needs to own this.\n\nLevi needs to have some counseling first with himself without any parents.  Second with his mother and then with you included if Levi wants you included.  But you should not be telling his father that he needs to go.  Again, not your responsibility.  And secondly your wife could take him and the father does not have any say so in it.  If he is with her it is up to her what to do with her son.\n\nYou need to take a backseat for now.

And going over to his father&#39;s home to deal with it without her in the lead is way out of bounds.  Stop It!  I would tell you to mind your own business.  </p>\n\n<p>First of all you should get out the mix of punishing Levi.  Yes, it your home but you need to not be the one punishing Levi at all.  Discuss it with your wife privately and let her handle it.  She is setting you up to FAIL.  Shame on her!</p>\n\n<p>Can you be fair with Levi?  I am not sure. Maybe.  I would say no, because Male Lions like to eat the young of other males.  Your wife needs to own this.</p>\n\n<p>Levi needs to have some counseling first with himself without any parents.  Second with his mother and then with you included if Levi wants you included.  But you should not be telling his father that he needs to go.  Again, not your responsibility.  And secondly your wife could take him and the father does not have any say so in it.  If he is with her it is up to her what to do with her son.</p>\n\n<p>You need to take a backseat for now.  If not, you are headed into a lot of unhappy times with your stepson, your wife, and his father.</p>\n\n<p>My 2 cents.</p>\n</div>",

You need to talk to her and ask her how she feels about your daughters and if she would\u2019ve let them go unpunished if the roles were reversed. And then, you need to prioritize your children and contemplate whether a divorce is necessary because it actually might be. No, you don\u2019t have to get a divorce all because random people on Reddit who don\u2019t know the entirety of your marriage are telling you to, but you already know that as a father the safety of your kids should be your number 1 priority and anyone who gets in the way of that needs to be removed for your children\u2019s safety.

Anything that YOU DID NOT purchase for him needs to go either to his father\u2019s house or his grandparents house because he should NOT be allowed back in your home at all. This isn\u2019t just about the books being destroyed. This is really the straw that broke the camels back because he\u2019s been doing this to you and your daughters REPEATEDLY.

Does your wife have sole custody with Dad visits? Joint custody?  IANAL but you should be involved in any custody hearings.\n\nCalling the police isn't going to result in much more than you looking like the bad guy to everyone else, IMHO.\n\nYou have a parental duty to protect your children, including Levi when he is in your care, but Levi's actions raise suspicion, and he's definitely on a path of abuse. I wouldn't focus on the books or punishment or consequences.  I'd focus on Levi's mental health IMMEDIATELY.  And you'll need professional help with that.  If Levi has harmed the other kids, you are the person that will be held accountable.

It&#39;s not that bad or scary, yeah it&#39;s always worrisome when a govt worker who has the power to remove your children comes into your home, but, if there is nothing to worry about they will not take your children.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, CPS is a good idea with an abusive child.  Then CPS can mandate counseling for the family and child.  CPS may elect to remove Levi if the other children are in danger, but he would likely be placed in a therapeutic residential program instead of foster.  CPS could remove Susan and the little one IF you do not protect them from your Stepson.</p>\n</div>",

I told her that it was her actions that caused the damage, and that she would have to repair it herself. I explained that every dollar her dad and I earn represents labor we put in, so repairing the screen would cost us not just money, but the labor to earn that money, and it wasn't fair to us to force us to do extra work forher mistake. So I told her she had three options: \n\n1) Work off the replacement cost of the screen *before* it got repaired (since its not like our jobs front us money even if we could use it). I presented her with a lousy of chores (outside her normal chores/allowance, which I said I wouldn't be paying extra for because that's the expectation) and what each one would pay, saying I'd place the money in a safe she could keep in her room until she saved enough to pay for the fix in full.\n\n2) Give up an activity she really wanted to do (a Taekwondo summer camp) so I could use the money to pay for the repair.\n\n3) Use the iPad as is.\n\nI also stressed that when she's an adult and it's not her stuff she breaks that option 3 isn't an option, if you break something you must replace it, even if its an accident, because it's not okay to make someone endure a loss because of your actions. We demonstrated that a month later when she took one of my portable chargers to a friend's house and wound up losing it, and I made her turn in her phone to me until she did enough chores to pay off the charger with the understanding that if she didn't do it in a timely manner (it was a $15 charger so I said two weeks was more than reasonable to work it off) that I would be taking her phone off our plan to use the money to buy myself a replacement, and she'd have to pay the $25 reconnect fee in order to get it back on. The chores were done in 2 days. \n\nLevi needs to pay to replace Susan's books, but there are ways to make that palatable but where the lesson is still learned. If Levi's mom and dad refuse to make him learn that lesson then the lesson needs to be theirs: \"let it go\" is not an option when someone is physically or financially harmed. They need to be presented with an itemized bill for the ruined books and told that it will be getting paid one way or another, and Susan should not have to be subjected to Levi's bullying and torment, so if his parents won't put a stop to it OP needs to make those assurances himself by either not allowing Levi to come back or by moving out and letting his wife deal with that fallout.

OP can provide a stable, predictable environment with rules and boundaries where everyone should expect to be respected and respectful. This is a *necessary* counterbalance to his dad\u2019s place where he gets away with murder. \n\nLevi can choose not to stay with OP or participate in their functional household as long as mom and bio dad let him run away, and OP is right not to allow him back until he does as long as bio dad is willing to have him.  But if OP were to go nuclear in this way, it undermines everything OP has done to build that environment and expectation for Levi in his home, and thus destroys any possibility of Levi coming around, being a functional member of the family, and adjusting to the expectations OP has set out.\n\nThis is PEAK Reddit nonsense.

His dad is walking anhedonia and his mom is an alcoholic and his step dad is a gun toting trump loving fake redneck, it\u2019s just sad.</p>\n\n<p>A work friend says she sees pics of them on FB and how kids hair is a mess. I feel bad for him. But I tried.</p>\n</div>",
