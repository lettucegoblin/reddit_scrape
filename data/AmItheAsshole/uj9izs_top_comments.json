You need to do whatever you need to do to help yourself and your children, and if that means putting her on the road then do it, and don't feel guilty.  Oh and BTW, your sister isn't as normal as she claims to be. Normal people don't yell and start a fight at a child's birthday party. That was a pretty horrible thing for her to do at a 3 year old's birthday party particularly given that your wife's parents were there. Your sister may not realize it, but she needs a lot of help dealing with her anger issues. Maybe when she lands in a new place she can start working on herself. Again, NTA",

And she needs to learn that you know you can't just say whatever that you want especially in someone else's home and think that it's going to be good and you're just going to eat cake for the rest of the night. \n\nMany years ago I ended up throwing my mother's eldest sister out of our home because she was just an unbelievable c*** in the worst of the worst ways and absolute bully. Didn't pay for s*** didn't contribute was just extremely hostile and loud and unfortunately my mother was among other things she was pretty spineless when it came to dealing with her sisters and her mother and so my aunt knew that she could get away with whatever she wanted. It wasn't until I was dealing with another Health crisis I had extremely bad asthma at the age of 16 and my aunt refused to not smoke in the house. That was the last straw for me I was like you can go smoke on the streets get out. \n\nNobody has the right to disrespect you and your family and disrespect your home.

Divorce is very destabilizing and we don\u2019t know the whole story of what led up to it. Why can\u2019t the son live with his dad for instance? </p>\n\n<p>You aren\u2019t the asshole because you don\u2019t have to be endlessly patient while you are trying to recover and help your family rebuild their world. That\u2019s not your job right now. Sure your sister is in a bad spot at a low time, but she is an adult. She has to take some responsibility for picking up the pieces of her own life. No matter what, her grief doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior. She owes you and your family an apology, which will probably take years for her to muster if she can manage at all.</p>\n</div>",

Just know that you are doing a great job raising your boys and your wife would be very proud of you. If you haven\u2019t already looked into it, I suggest therapy for your two older boys. It helped my eldest boy tremendously; my youngest was too young to remember her. I also suggest therapy for you. Sometimes you can get this type of therapy for free through the hospital she attended. There are also a ton of support groups out there that you can join. Lean on Reddit. There are tons of cancer subreddits with some absolutely amazing people there to support you. Unfortunately there are too many people like you going through the same thing. It helps to have a group of people to share with. Hang in there OP, you\u2019re not alone, and we\u2019re here for you.</p>\n</div>",

That's an option. That's something that doesn't always HAVE to happen. Obviously, OP's (former) BIL made the right choice in divorcing that harpie. It was just painful imagining how OP's family from his wife's side was also so distraught over the sister's behavior, and she wasn't having it, insisting on being right. This is, unfortunately, her attempt at enforcing toxic masculinity, and I'm relieved (and absolutely proud, of course!) that OP didn't take that insult lying down, because it is NEVER wrong to cry. The phrase \"Be a man\" and similar need to be erased from the human language in every way imaginable. Someone crying isn't seen as weak. I feel weak when I cry, but I know it's because I'm vulnerable. And THERE is the difference. Weak, no. Vulnerable? ABSOLUTELY. This is going to be a grieving process that'll ache like a raw wound and take time to heal, but it sounds like OP's already on the right track to make it a bit smoother and less painful.\n\nGood on you, OP, for standing your ground, not taking her abuse (yes, that's at minimum, verbal abuse (former veterinary receptionist who's been screamed and cursed out before many times, so I'd know)), and showing she went too far.
