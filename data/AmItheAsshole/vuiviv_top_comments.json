They aren&#39;t the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>A person with this type of problem has real issues. The company is doing itself and all of you disservice by brushing it aside. It&#39;s not going to get better. If your reframing hasn&#39;t gotten him to take a look at himself and work to change, he&#39;s not capable of it without help.</p>\n\n<p>But calling him a crybaby is patronizing. You are now just trying to goad him to get angrier. It might make you feel good, but it&#39;s a dangerous game to play. And kind of petty.</p>\n\n<p>Management needs to do their job and make him aware that his anger issues are a problem and will affect his job.\nIf he doesn&#39;t change, he needs to go.</p>\n</div>",

He was only ever punished if he did certain things in an anger outburst ie. break things, or speak disrespectfully. It really helped him learn to express himself healthily. He spent less and less time needing to cool off because he knew how to talk through it more effectively.

But I&#39;ve always hated chihuahua&#39;s because my mostly bedridden grandmother had one that would bite when I went to hug her (not just me, any kid, my sister and cousins hated that creature too) and I was always told that was just how little dogs are, and he was only being protective.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays I still hate them because when I take my cats to the vet, appropriately secured in a crate, medium and large dogs are always brought in on a leash, and even if they&#39;re not entirely well behaved and lunge at my cats crate the owner will yank them back and apologize, and then sit on the other side of the waiting room to keep their dog away from my cat. Little dog owners though? They Never have them crated or leashed and laugh off all aggressive behavior. As if the rules just don&#39;t apply to them...</p>\n</div>",
