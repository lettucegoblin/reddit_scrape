This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nI have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Also it would be nice if we could collectively move on from pulling the \"Karen\" card so often in the comments, but I will choose my battles here).\n3. It really wasn't cool for pregnant woman to make you, another human being, complicit in her decision to potentially harm her fetus, even if it is legal, and even if she is paying for it. If anything, drinking while pregnant is pretty unequivocally a total AH move.\n\nYour ideal course of action *would have* been to tell your manager at the time that you weren't comfortable serving drinks to her. Manager would have been annoyed with you, and served the pregnant woman, and then you could talk about those laws you didn't know about.

Even though others are chalking this up to <em>&quot;you were trying to control her,&quot;</em> I don&#39;t smell that. I see someone doing what they thought was right, even though it was poorly handled. (Also it would be nice if we could collectively move on from pulling the &quot;Karen&quot; card so often in the comments, but I will choose my battles here).</li>\n<li>It really wasn&#39;t cool for pregnant woman to make you, another human being, complicit in her decision to potentially harm her fetus, even if it is legal, and even if she is paying for it. If anything, drinking while pregnant is pretty unequivocally a total AH move.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your ideal course of action <em>would have</em> been to tell your manager at the time that you weren&#39;t comfortable serving drinks to her. Manager would have been annoyed with you, and served the pregnant woman, and then you could talk about those laws you didn&#39;t know about. Now you&#39;re in hot water because you made some decisions without being upfront about how you felt about the situation.</p>\n\n<p>NAH. It just all sucks.</p>\n</div>",

And I'm saying it because I really want you to hear it, and learn. \n\nFirstly, you don't get Foetal Alcohol Syndrome from 2 cocktails. There are different guidelines about alcohol consumption during pregnancy, in different regions. Some cultures posit certain alcohols as beneficial. The science tells us that serious, binge-type or alcoholic drinking is indeed a big risk factor and the risk goes up the more you drink, but there is no standard agreement about much lower levels. Many doctors say stress is a bigger risk to a foetus and advise that a glass or two occasionally is worthwhile if it relaxes the mother. You really should know more about this if you're going to be serving drinks for a living. What did they teach you about it when you did your Responsible Service of Alcohol certification, or whatever the equivalent is in your country? Did they cover the topic? If not, please take this as a teaching moment and do some research yourself. You really should know what you are talking about before you go around making decisions for other people.\n\nSecondly, why haven't you learnt yet when to butt out of other people's business? That's a problem. People wanting to dictate to others is a leading cause of the worst aspects of society & human nature. It is not a small deal, this matters a lot, in terms of what kind of person you are going to be and how you will affect the world around you. Listen to this carefully: you NEVER know what is going on in someone else's life. Never. The French have a saying: *\"tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner\"*. It means if all is understood, all is forgiven. By that they mean don't rushto judge other people, you can never know what they're going through. Only they know why they did what they did, and if you understood everything about their life you would likely be much more forgiving of their behaviour.\n\nWhat you did was judgmental in the extreme, and based on ignorance of the situation. It is just plain wrong to sit in judgment on other people like that. The only time it's okay is when their actions affect you, and hers didn't.\n\nI know you were acting out of good intentions, but good intentions are often just not enough, they can cause chaos. They can pave the road to hell. Good intentions must go hand in hand with good information, wisdom, and humility.\n\nThe professional aspects have been covered by a lot of people above, all I'll say is that it is unethical to lie to a customer, and it is unethical\u2014even illegal at times\u2014to deliberately serve what was not requested.\n\nYou say your parents agree with you, and that may be where you got your sense of being entitled to override the decision of another functional adult and insert your own morality into their lives. Are they often judgmental? Did they teach you that it is okay to decide you know best what another should do? You need to think about that carefully. Because it is not okay, it is arrogant and it is foolish and it is potentially very dangerous.\n\nYou also seriously need to reconsider your own morals. What made you think it was okay to lie to this woman? A lie of omission is just as bad as a lie of commission. Can you see the hypocrisy of this? You got on your high horse about her decision, and then in a moral huff thought it perfectly fine to ignore her legitimate order, sit in judegment on her choices, and then LIE to her about it. Who has the moral high ground now?\n\nShe had every right to take back her tip, you're lucky she didn't do worse. She would have felt awful after this: angry, disrespected, judged, cheated.

Technically what she did was discrimination, fraud, and food tampering. Treating a customer differently because she is pregnant is classed as discrimination. She was going to edit the bill to hide that she'd served different drinks than ordered - which are usually different prices - which is classed as food tampering and fraud, and any business that sells alcohol and charges someone for alcohol, yet actually serves something else or waters it down etc, can lose its license.   \n\n\nIf the woman was really pregnant, then she's an asshole, no doubt. But everything that OP did was wrong according to the law, and frankly, morally. Being upfront about refusing service and why would have been sticking to their moral principles, discrimination be damned. But sneaking about and lying is not sticking to their principles, it's fucking over the business and every employee in there because OP assumed she knew best. A pat on the head and a \"customer is always right\" speech doesn't cut it here, OP is lucky she wasn't fired on the spot.",

Technically what she did was discrimination, fraud, and food tampering. Treating a customer differently because she is pregnant is classed as discrimination. She was going to edit the bill to hide that she&#39;d served different drinks than ordered - which are usually different prices - which is classed as food tampering and fraud, and any business that sells alcohol and charges someone for alcohol, yet actually serves something else or waters it down etc, can lose its license.   </p>\n\n<p>If the woman was really pregnant, then she&#39;s an asshole, no doubt. But everything that OP did was wrong according to the law, and frankly, morally. Being upfront about refusing service and why would have been sticking to their moral principles, discrimination be damned. But sneaking about and lying is not sticking to their principles, it&#39;s fucking over the business and every employee in there because OP assumed she knew best. A pat on the head and a &quot;customer is always right&quot; speech doesn&#39;t cut it here, OP is lucky she wasn&#39;t fired on the spot.</p>\n</div>",

I personally worked at places where you could order virgin drinks (that didn't have and weren't intended to have alcohol at any point) marketed as virgin coctails, they would not have the same content as something where just the alcohol was removed.

Cat poop is only dangerous if they\u2019ve eaten raw meat and pregnant women can be immune to toxoplasmosis. A small amount of alcohol is fine if it\u2019s not a habit. Bed rest is actually pretty useless. I\u2019ve done my homework, have you?</p>\n\n<p>ETA: Y\u2019all can downvote me into oblivion but the opinions of Internet randos will not mean more to me than words from a doctor or medical researcher.</p>\n\n<p>And since you\u2019re assuming anyway, I have no stomach for alcohol so I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t like sushi, and I don\u2019t own a cat. Telling me to \u2018talk to my doctor\u2019 is you not backing up your opinions because you think you know better. So unless you\u2019re citing sources, IDGAF what you <em>think</em> should be done with pregnant bodies.</p>\n</div>",
