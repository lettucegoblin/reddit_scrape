While I didn't poop myself during the actual pushing part, during my labours for both my kids, my husband stood over me and massaged my hips and back while I did the stinkiest, most disgusting poops of my life on the toilet. I was in too much pain to wipe, so he did that for me too. Then, he told me I was amazing and doing great and that he was in awe of my strength.  He's never once brought up any of the \"gross\" things that my body expelled during childbirth, as a \"joke\" or otherwise. \n\nGiving birth is the hardest thing I've ever done. You are NTA. You are incredible.  Don't let your husband bully you into feeling ashamed of doing something natural while bringing life into the world.",

I'm so glad my husband isn't an asshole, there has been more than one incident of him making me laugh so hard I've had to change my trousers, and he never made me feel humiliated or ashamed. \n\nI'm pretty sure I did shit myself when I gave birth too. Although no one ever mentioned it, is it safer to assume I did because it happens to anyone who has any fecal matter in their colon - and I was eating and drinking normally leading up to labour and delivery.

Even if you hadn\u2019t mentioned it too much before, he should have been able to pick up on your body language of not liking it and stopping before you got your boiling point</p>\n\n<p>NTA</p>\n</div>",

They bond together while bullying one another, with the alliances always forming around whoever the weakest prey is at the moment. It's very similar to hazing or other bullying, but with them, it never ends.\n\nJokes are funny. They're meant to entertain and amuse the listener.\n\nI'll say it again. They are using the \"humor\" defense as a way of normalizing the predatory way they treat one another.\n\nI've had family like that. The kind of family where you dread making a single, simple mistake like getting ketchup on your shirt or stumbling while walking down the street. Or even mispronouncing a word. Because you know they will never stop bringing it up and **enjoying your discomfort because they feed on it.**\n\nOnce I turned 18, I no longer saw these people. Because I refuse to be their meal.\n\n\"Energy vampires\" is a pretty common term these days. If OP doesn't teach her husband to stop being cruel for his enjoyment, she and her child are in for a shitty life of always walking on eggshells, trying to avoid his ridicule.",

He would of course roll back into this great guy, 30% of the time one month...60% the next...2% the next... it was a nightmare of confusing rollercoaster.

My little guy was due January 6th.\n\nOn Christmas we go to my husband's parent's house for brunch, they do it every year and the food is AWESOME. It's so good!\nSo Christmas morning I am shoveling the food in, it's so good it's hard to stop. I start to feel funny and I am thinking I ate too much, so excuse myself to the bathroom. I noticed that I have lost my plug, it's a little early but not totally uncommon in the week or two before having a baby. I was keeping my cool but then I got super emotional and wanted to go home. I tell my husband I feel off and want to go home right then despite everyone starting to open presents. He goes okay, tells his family that we are leaving and we'll call later. \nBefore we even made it to the freeway my contractions kick in hard. He calls the midwife to explain that I am in labor.\nWe get home, and I am in the full swing of labor and I try to get to bathroom and I did quite get there. I was in the hall on all fours contracting and my head was in the bathroom, I totally lost it. Threw up absolutely everything I just ate and drank. My husband says there was about an inch of vomit covering the whole floor. He calls the midwife to give an update, I am feeling pretty good on the hallway floor, so he gets off the phone, makes sure I am okay and gets to cleaning up the floor. \nHe cleaned up so much vomit, and he got it all cleaned up before the midwife got there. His sister came over and washed all of the towels he used, seriously, we had no towels left after that.\n\nHe and I both joke about me vomiting, but that is key, we both talk about it because it was a crazy amount of vomit, and the whole situation is funny to us both. Very much like the Exorcist!. If I did have a problem with it he wouldn't talk about it. He's an awesome person like that though. Poor OP.",

I guess it's not OK for girls to even maybe get fat when they grow up, but men are above reproach.\n\nHe really wanted my parents to punish me for being rude to him when I \"talked back\" as well, and they just laughed at him and said he shouldn't be rude to us in the first place.

It was hard and exhausting and emotional and even scary (I ended up needing an emergency c-section after hours of pushing because my baby was in the wrong position with his umbilical cord wrapped around him and his heart rate was plummeting). \nAnyone who would \u201cjoke\u201d about what their wife went through during labor is absolutely an asshole.
