I have been working for a while in an international birth trauma NGO. I have spoken to and worked with a lot of people, both those who gave birth and partners. It isn\u2019t as uncommon as you may think for a parent (either parent), to be unable to bond with the child due to traumatic birth. I am not even talking about death here, just severe PTSD and trauma from birth. This is not (in my experience) because of a rational process of saying \u201cit is your fault my partner suffered/died\u201d. In fact, in most cases, most of the suffering is caused by poor care, lack of empathy and misogyny of staff and doctors. \n\nOf the sample of people I have worked with, some have resolved their issues of bonding with their children. However, I have worked with people who made the decision to have relatives take the child or have them adopted altogether. I\u2019ve experiences (few, thankfully) with partners whose SO died during the birth or shortly after. The common response I hear is that they do not blame the child in their rational mind, but because of both the grief and the trauma, they do not feel they can be adequate parents. As much as in your rational mind you know it isn\u2019t the direct fault of the child, the connection between the child and the trauma can be difficult to overcome. Therapy doesn\u2019t help everyone. And for many healing takes too long and it really is best for them to give the child a better chance with someone else. \n\n You may feel I am trying to justify his actions, but it\u2019s quite the opposite. In fact, for this reason he is very much the AH for making a point to make you feel guilty about something that wasn\u2019t your fault. \n\nBecause If he made the decision to not have you be a part of his life,he should have made peace with that decision and simply stayed away. Most people I worked with that made such decisions feel it is the best decision not just for themselves but also for their child. They leave the child specifically to *avoid* the situation that you have been put in! In this case he made the decisions to not be involved with raising you but also wanted to make your life miserable. That is horrible malicious behaviour. \n\n\nYou were right to tell his new wife because she has a right to know this about her husband. This is part of informed consent. He needs therapy, and realize that he is the one that created this toxic mess in the first place.\n\nThere needs to be a lot more awareness about birth trauma, how serious it is, how much it affects families and how much suffering it can bring. It really isn\u2019t discussed enough or given enough funding or attention. The dismissive attitude with which parents, especially women, are treated when trying to speak up about birth trauma contributes to resentment. \n\nYou did the right thing.

My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. \n\nIt hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me \u201ckilling\u201d her and he can\u2019t stand to look at my face. \n\nYou can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That\u2019s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. \n\nMy aunt doesn\u2019t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that\u2019s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn\u2019t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It\u2019s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason about why we\u2019re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. \n\nBut he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing tough because of \u201clife stuff.\u201d It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. \n\nI told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma\u2019s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it\u2019s been put in jeopardy. \n\nMy dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn\u2019t agree at all with what he did and it could\u2019ve been avoided if I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nFor me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious.

You all care about his happiness but where were you all when he was blaming me and making my life miserable? He doesn\u2019t get a pass at that\u201d\n\nThis is it. This is the answer, OP. He ruined his own marriage. That's the consequence he has to face for choosing to treat you like shit for something you're not responsible for.\n\nThat's right, OP - you are NOT responsible for what happened, no matter what your father might try to tell you. Your mother's death was tragic, but it was no one's fault. Him repeatedly blaming you (his child, who wasn't even born yet) for 'killing her' is fucked up.\n\nSomething not many people understand is that **you might go through trauma, but that doesn't give you a free pass for putting others through the same.** You can be a victim and a villain at the same time. Losing his wife to things out of his control is hard, but he's still in the wrong for treating you badly, and he'll be held accountable for it.\n\nYou did nothing but tell SM the truth. A relationship that can be ruined by a simple truth is a relationship built on lies. Simply knowing that my husband is an absent, horribly cruel father (who has no intentions of changing) would be an instant deal breaker for me, but knowing that he lied about it for our whole relationship so I wouldn't walk away is just... wow.\n\nThing is, leaving would entirely be your SM's choice, one you cannot make for her. She deserves to know the true man she married, which is exactly what you gave her. Your dad can't blame you for that.\n\nAlso this bit:\n\n>They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives \n\nFor one, he needs to quit saying you ruined his marriage, because you didn't. He did.\n\nMore importantly though, the way he talks about your involvement in his life is pissing me off. He's acting like 'including' you in his life is a sacrifice he has to make, a favor to you, but it's neither. You don't owe him anything - HE should be the grateful one, being thankful you're even open to reconciling the relationship.",
