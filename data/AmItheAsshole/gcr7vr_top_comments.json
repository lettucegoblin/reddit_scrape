I honestly don\u2019t mind because I\u2019m busy and am very happy in my own life. I have just kind of accepted that\u2019s the way he is. He can also be pretty insensitive (says things without thinking) but I just laugh it off. \n\nMy mum on the other hand has been through a lot - she was very ill for a few years and I had to remind him to contact her and ask her how she is / if he can do anything for her because she told me he doesn\u2019t seem to care that she\u2019s even in hospital (this was a few years ago). I have to text him to remind him of Mother\u2019s Day and her birthday every year. My parents every few months pass a comment about him not making any effort with them other than when he contacts them when he needs something like a tax form, birth cert, career advice. Neither of us live at home for years and he never calls over to say hi or have dinner with them. He\u2019s very babyish in a lot of ways, he finds it very hard to read signals from people, to empathise with someone or to consider others feelings.. not in a horrible way, they just don\u2019t click for him.. hence why I never take things personally. \n\nMy point is because of all of this my mum gets quite upset that he can seem to do all of the nice gestures for a girlfriend and seems to forget about his own family. I know she said last xmas she didn\u2019t want to know about his girlfriends present when he was going on and on about it. He was very confused by this because he just doesn\u2019t get the bigger picture and it wasn\u2019t really about her Xmas present... so it might not be about the baking? I\u2019ve no idea what your relationship is like with your family but that\u2019s my side of one situation as a sister, hope it helps. \n\nI will say both of my parents are absolutely amazing, a great team, so loving. They have instilled really good morals in us all and have always put us before any of their needs and wants. They poured money into any extra classes we needed grinds in as kids - sports, dancing classes, music lessons.. anything we wanted (except materialistic things we didn\u2019t need so we were not spoilt in that way) while cutting back on themselves to afford this. They really showed us how to work hard, earn our keep and have given us amazing life skills so there\u2019s no reason for my brother to be like this, he just is the way he is.",

I have been cooking since I was 12 (35 years,)  And, they would criticize what I made when THEY asked me to cook.

You eat what was made and are grateful for it.  Yet, THEY constantly criticized the cooking of a teen who was learning. I stopped cooking for them much,  around the time I met my husband at age 21. Now, I am over age 45 and they beg for my food, but I have trouble making it for them.\n\nMy in-laws often think my food is too fancy, so we usually bring cookies or a boring church cookbook casserole to their house on holidays (we don't see them much, b/c they are kind of assholes, live far away, and never call us--yet get offended when we don't call or come see them. )\n\nI guess my point is that cooking and baking are sometimes acts of love for people.

If they (your mother and sister, going forward YMAS) feel this entitled to *all* the cool stuff you do, not just the thoughtful romantic stuff, then it's a sign they could have trouble letting go when you go to culinary school and become a successful pastry chef in Las Vegas or something equally wonderful. (But seriously, if you're enjoying it this much, business degree and/or culinary school might be a great career to start researching.) \n\nYMAS may not be constant attention-seekers jealous of your high school GF, and if that's the case then they may just be surprised by the scope and depth of the effort you put into the desserts when it's all condensed into an awesome scrapbook. It's hard to find guys who put in a lot of effort, especially at your age. Somewhere along the way someone was a good example to you of how to be a caring partner. It would just be weird if seeing that makes YMAS feel like they're entitled to all of your time and attention instead of your GF.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. When you start working toward an adult relationship, your GF and eventually fiancee and wife, is supposed to come before your siblings and parents. If they (your mother and sister, going forward YMAS) feel this entitled to <em>all</em> the cool stuff you do, not just the thoughtful romantic stuff, then it&#39;s a sign they could have trouble letting go when you go to culinary school and become a successful pastry chef in Las Vegas or something equally wonderful. (But seriously, if you&#39;re enjoying it this much, business degree and/or culinary school might be a great career to start researching.) </p>\n\n<p>YMAS may not be constant attention-seekers jealous of your high school GF, and if that&#39;s the case then they may just be surprised by the scope and depth of the effort you put into the desserts when it&#39;s all condensed into an awesome scrapbook. It&#39;s hard to find guys who put in a lot of effort, especially at your age. Somewhere along the way someone was a good example to you of how to be a caring partner. It would just be weird if seeing that makes YMAS feel like they&#39;re entitled to all of your time and attention instead of your GF.</p>\n</div>",

You can absolutely do what you want with what you bake, hence why I don't think you're the asshole, but it might be nice to make something for your family especially if you use ingredients they buy (which again IDK if you do, you could be buying them all on your own in which case I still think there are no assholes here). My brother is getting into baking and offers me stuff all the time, especially when it's something he knows I like. I would be hurt if he gave his girlfriend hundreds of baked goods and I never got one.

Then, if they want to do it they know I don't expect it for free, but they don't feel obligated do it if they don't want. For example, one of my best friends is a photographer, and I needed to get someone to do family photos. We traded websites etc of photographers back and forth, because she knew what to look for in a \"good\" photographer. I do the same when people ask me to tutor their kids (I'm a teacher), l'll help them figure out what their kid needs and help them find someone legit, but I don't want to do it myself, usually. And I absolutely wouldn't do it for free.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>When I have friends in the profession of something I need, I always ask for advice from them a out if they know someone, or could help me find someone because I want it done well. Then, if they want to do it they know I don&#39;t expect it for free, but they don&#39;t feel obligated do it if they don&#39;t want. For example, one of my best friends is a photographer, and I needed to get someone to do family photos. We traded websites etc of photographers back and forth, because she knew what to look for in a &quot;good&quot; photographer. I do the same when people ask me to tutor their kids (I&#39;m a teacher), l&#39;ll help them figure out what their kid needs and help them find someone legit, but I don&#39;t want to do it myself, usually. And I absolutely wouldn&#39;t do it for free.</p>\n</div>",
