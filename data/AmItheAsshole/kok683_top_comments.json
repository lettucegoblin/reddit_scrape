I would be concerned about having her around your brother when you are not there. She waited until you were not around to threaten a 12 year old with abandonment. Considering your comment that she had no family and no where to go it is unfathomable that she could be so cruel to your brother.

Mostly because there\u2019s no way to bring it back!! There is no justice and it shows us just how cruel life can be. A child needs real allies to soften the world and their hearts, of course! But soften the world too much and reality is lost, as is the lesson.  I wholeheartedly know... feeling sorry for oneself has no true benefit in living life. As my grandfather told me, \u201cSadness makes us human but sitting in that sadness makes us alone.\u201d  It\u2019s above an adult level but if your brother can grasp it now, he will be far better connecting with everyone throughout his life.  Think about the people you know who have experienced great loss... If they disengaged, wallowed and felt sorry for themselves did they ever really thrive after? And if they engaged and came from a place of gratitude could they exist without being just a shell? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I would feel gutted if your brother felt he had to show you gratitude or he\u2019d be on the street. This would be devastating and add insult to injury. I appreciate you as a person for doing everything to give him a safe place! You did not have to adopt him! You did because you are a great person and how humans should be! What a great role model you are! Perhaps he was helping unload groceries because he was showing gratitude? Let him give the gift of gratitude because it is a gift!! A gift you clearly do not need but a gift that gives the giver something to give. Please don\u2019t underestimate the importance of this in healing and in life. Wow, he does sound like a nice kid!!  And him being grateful instead of entitled will benefit him tremendously! Long game my friend! \n\nI have people that hold me accountable for any sort of self wallowing and make me engage. And I have cheerleaders! And at the end of the day I\u2019m thankful to have both! And I suppose I want both for everybody else too! You from me and this post and your bother...  \n\n\nBest of Luck you good human!",

And if they engaged and came from a place of gratitude could they exist without being just a shell? </p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I would feel gutted if your brother felt he had to show you gratitude or he\u2019d be on the street. This would be devastating and add insult to injury. I appreciate you as a person for doing everything to give him a safe place! You did not have to adopt him! You did because you are a great person and how humans should be! What a great role model you are! Perhaps he was helping unload groceries because he was showing gratitude? Let him give the gift of gratitude because it is a gift!! A gift you clearly do not need but a gift that gives the giver something to give. Please don\u2019t underestimate the importance of this in healing and in life. Wow, he does sound like a nice kid!!  And him being grateful instead of entitled will benefit him tremendously! Long game my friend! </p>\n\n<p>I have people that hold me accountable for any sort of self wallowing and make me engage. And I have cheerleaders! And at the end of the day I\u2019m thankful to have both! And I suppose I want both for everybody else too! You from me and this post and your bother...  </p>\n\n<p>Best of Luck you good human!</p>\n</div>",

Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left. \n \nI fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.\n\nHonestly it hasn\u2019t been easy. We\u2019re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.\n\nHis behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there\u2019s days where he\u2019s withdrawn.\n\nDays before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.\n\nMy girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.\n\nYesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. \n\nMy brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don\u2019t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he\u2019d think that and he told me what happened.\n\nThat day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I\u2019m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. \n\nI was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn\u2019t deny it. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I \u201cgave up my life\u201d to take care of him. \nAnd the thing about giving him up isn\u2019t that big of a deal to her because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll actually do it.\n\nI said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn\u2019t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.\n\nSince last night I\u2019ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. \n\nThey\u2019ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I\u2019m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am proud of you for taking in your brother, and it seems like you're the kind of person who didn't have to think long before taking guardianship of him. \n\nI have a 6 year old who is in therapy due to a significant number of traumas and issues that he has experienced in his life. Protecting them is the number one priority, and their mental health is so important because it is so fragile with little ones. They do not have the tools or experience to work through thier issues without a lot of help. \n\nYour girlfriend did something unspeakable and really set back any progress you have made with him. That conversation she had will stick with him for awhile and it will have effects on him. He can however, take a better position on the matter if he is shown unequivocal proof of your love and dedication to keeping him safe. \n\nYou need to get rid of the girlfriend and stand behind him over the next few years. He will see that you have gotten rid of her and will be able to rest any insecurities about abandonment, as well as taking a lot of comfort in you by sticking with him. He probably won't fully recognize his own emotions either, but in due time he will recognize how much it meant to him for you to be steadfast about providing a safe home for him. \n\nAs a single father, I have dated seriously one time (that relationship ended amicably but we just didnt work out). But I have thought long and hard about what kinds of situations may arise by bringing a new woman into the household and I have determined what kinds of situations I will and will not put up with in regards to how my son is treated. \n\nProtecting the best interest of the children is a cut-throat game. I am prepared to throw away even the best of relationships if it means keeping my son safe and happy. And you should do the same for your little bro. \n\nI am so sorry that you have been put into this situation, and I feel for your brother. I cannot imagine what he has been through recently. Just remember to always give him his space and focus on his emotional wellbeing. Validating his feelings and talking about his feelings is paramount to having a healthy little adult, and will give him the comfort and safety that he so desperately needs right now. \n\nIt will be tough at times, and it will get difficult. But if you continue to be the lighthouse that he can see in even the worst of storms, you will be his beacon of strength for years to come.",

That conversation she had will stick with him for awhile and it will have effects on him. He can however, take a better position on the matter if he is shown unequivocal proof of your love and dedication to keeping him safe. </p>\n\n<p>You need to get rid of the girlfriend and stand behind him over the next few years. He will see that you have gotten rid of her and will be able to rest any insecurities about abandonment, as well as taking a lot of comfort in you by sticking with him. He probably won&#39;t fully recognize his own emotions either, but in due time he will recognize how much it meant to him for you to be steadfast about providing a safe home for him. </p>\n\n<p>As a single father, I have dated seriously one time (that relationship ended amicably but we just didnt work out). But I have thought long and hard about what kinds of situations may arise by bringing a new woman into the household and I have determined what kinds of situations I will and will not put up with in regards to how my son is treated. </p>\n\n<p>Protecting the best interest of the children is a cut-throat game. I am prepared to throw away even the best of relationships if it means keeping my son safe and happy. And you should do the same for your little bro. </p>\n\n<p>I am so sorry that you have been put into this situation, and I feel for your brother. I cannot imagine what he has been through recently. Just remember to always give him his space and focus on his emotional wellbeing. Validating his feelings and talking about his feelings is paramount to having a healthy little adult, and will give him the comfort and safety that he so desperately needs right now. </p>\n\n<p>It will be tough at times, and it will get difficult. But if you continue to be the lighthouse that he can see in even the worst of storms, you will be his beacon of strength for years to come.</p>\n</div>",

I adapted and stayed on top of all my responsibilities because my younger brother deserved a good life. I couldn't give him one if I didn't stay on track. I had no support or anyone to lean on. I was drowning.\n\nI was 14, our house had been burnt down, my mother's girlfriend was murdered, my mother was on a few month drunk and my brother, Noah, had been shot. My big brother, Eric, drove 3 days to take care of us. He was on the phone with his wife and he said, \"That's fine, you can take care of yourself. I don't owe you anything. I owe these kids my whole life.\" \n\nI was floored. We did matter to someone else. And even more than that, he was grateful for us. He didn't \"owe\" us anything. We were younger, we had never provided him with any necessities. He was saying that he was a successful person because we came along and needed guidance. They all became successful men to show us the right way and make sure we were provided for. \n\n22 years later I'm humbled that he would have given up every comfort he worked for to help me. I'm only who I am because he picked me back up. I was not far away from bad coping skills and bad habits and he literally saved my life by showing up that day and telling someone else we mattered. \n\nI hope that you and your brother find an easy path. I'm grateful that you stood up for him, I bet he is too. \n\nIt sounds like you have done so much to benefit him and make best of the situation. I have to agree with above and say family counseling. Only because it can give you better problem solving and coping skills when they arise.\n\n\n\nEdit: This is an emotional memory and I got wrapped up in writing it. I didn't even clarify my point. OP, a child's ability to forget hurtful memories is amazing! That year of my life was horrid and I have forgotten the majority of it. I cannot erase my brother being there for me. I cannot erase the words I heard him say, to the woman he longed to marry since high school. You're brother should know that security as well.\n\n The other thing: OP's GF did a very damaging thing. Of the few horrible memories I have is constantly being reminded that some of the people helping me, we're not obligated to. Constantly having that thrown in my face over the years made me co-dependent. I aimed to please everyone, couldn't say no and felt I didn't deserve anything I had. I felt I had to earn every piece of happiness or peace. I couldn't take credit for any accomplishments or compliments. It won't affect everyone the same however, he has lost most of his world and that treatment can't have any good outcome on him.
