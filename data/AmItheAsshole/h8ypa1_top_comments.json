Any questions can\u2019t and will be answered in the comments. \n\nLong story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can\u2019t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.\n\nAcross from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven\u2019t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady\u2019s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. \n\nI. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she\u2019s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It\u2019s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It\u2019s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then we had a fun afternoon where everyone was happy. \nMy parents could\u2019ve punished me by getting mad and not letting me play with anyone at all that day, which would\u2019ve made me feel absolutely terrible and embarrassed. I honestly didn\u2019t realise I wasn\u2019t being nice to my friend.</p>\n</div>",

They might even just think it\u2019s funny to see boobs. \n\nThey clearly needed to be taught a lesson, but I\u2019m not sure that taking away their video games was the answer. What I would have done is explained why what they did was wrong, and then if you catch them doing it again after they know what they\u2019re doing is wrong then you punish them. \n\nA lot of the NTA responses are accusing the husband of misogyny, which I think is really over-simplifying things and kind of misses the point. \n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to think people shouldn\u2019t be naked outside, regardless of gender and regardless of if you\u2019re on your own property or not. Now, that doesn\u2019t make it right for people to stare, but most people probably should assume that if you\u2019re outside you lose a lot of privacy. \n\nThe husband is still an asshole for trying to dismiss the seriousness of the problem and making her sleep on the couch, but he\u2019s not misogynistic in thinking she should wear clothes outside.",

If they see a topless woman they\u2019re going to want to look. It\u2019s natural and I don\u2019t think these kids are old enough to truly grasp that what they\u2019re doing is highly inappropriate. They might even just think it\u2019s funny to see boobs. </p>\n\n<p>They clearly needed to be taught a lesson, but I\u2019m not sure that taking away their video games was the answer. What I would have done is explained why what they did was wrong, and then if you catch them doing it again after they know what they\u2019re doing is wrong then you punish them. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of the NTA responses are accusing the husband of misogyny, which I think is really over-simplifying things and kind of misses the point. </p>\n\n<p>I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to think people shouldn\u2019t be naked outside, regardless of gender and regardless of if you\u2019re on your own property or not. Now, that doesn\u2019t make it right for people to stare, but most people probably should assume that if you\u2019re outside you lose a lot of privacy. </p>\n\n<p>The husband is still an asshole for trying to dismiss the seriousness of the problem and making her sleep on the couch, but he\u2019s not misogynistic in thinking she should wear clothes outside.</p>\n</div>",

I think I know what you're trying to say but the way it's phrased here is not ok. \n\n1. The way you phrase this means that anyone that takes an upskirt picture is in the clear because \"nobody was harmed\". Same principle. It's called voyeurism and just because one party isn't aware, it doesn't mean there was no harm done. \n2. There absolutely was harm done - an invasion of privacy. It's still a wrong even though the woman being spied on wasn't aware. \n3. While I agree on not making things like breasts forbidden, your statement of \"if boobs are forbidden, they'll keep looking\" to mean they'd keep infringing on the expected privacy of a woman in their own home is ... really missing the whole point of the post I feel. None of this is about them looking at boobs and being curious. The entire post is about two children violating someone's privacy. Them being curious about boobs, even forbidden boobs, does not and should not lead to them going out of their way to spy on someone. Those are not logical leaps if someone is taught to value and respect the boundaries and privacy of others. \n4. And I just caught the \"I know the neighbor thought she was out of view..\" She was. By OP's own words in the post, the boys had to go out of their way and hang over the balcony to see her. She would have been out of view. The boys went out of their way to see her. \n\nThe more I read your comment, the more it sounds like \"boys will be boys\" but in different words. \n\n\nImo, OP did great and made it about privacy. OP's husband probably also uses phrases like \"nobody was hurt\" to describe this, especially since he seems to think it's typical boy behaviour to disrespect someone in the quest for boobs.  It's only typical because it's been made typical.",

If you want to talk, then it should be easier for you to be decent with your words than to be mime-levels of silent for the rest of eternity. \n\nJesus wasnt advocating for eye plucking any more than someone using that saying is advocating for the person to actually be silent. The message is intended to get people to realize that they should be working towards self control, and only if then they feel that is impossible they should completely remove themselves from the temptation. But again the whole point is that self control *is possible*, and you should have it instead of needing to remove yourself from temptation. \n\nIf you have to forcibly remove yourself from a temptation, then you have yet to truly master your urges towards it. Its the same thing as with drinking for a lot of people. Some recovering alcoholics arent comfortable being around other people who are drinking, because they have to be completely removed from that temptation to avoid it. Im not trying to pass any judgement on that behavior, but I think it does illustrate the point.",
