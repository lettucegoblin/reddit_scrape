This is a difficult decision but based on what you have outlined about your brother being possibly neglectful to his own children, and your mother being in the same environment, I think that having your aunt be your sons guardian is the most responsible decision. I\u2019m going to assume that your mother is grieving already and is looking for something that reminds her of you, although if she\u2019s only 5 minutes away then I\u2019m not sure...Writing letters to your son for big milestones in his life (16th, 18th, 21st birthday, first heartbreak, first day of school, high school graduation, etc) would be a really great idea as well. I wish you all the best going forward and I hope you are at peace until the very end. Sending love, goodluck op.",

I would second all the ideas people have already given you on what to write (and record....seriously, having video and voice recordings is so, so important!) and I'd just like to add two more of my own ideas. When people die, everyone gives the family memories of all the good things they did, all the memories of them at their best. Which is great. But maybe (especially if you get to choose which stories) share stories of that time you cut class with your best friend and spent the day drinking at his place (or whatever). All your good, fun and funny stories that maybe someone wouldn't tell you son. Even leave them with your Aunt with instructions to only give it to him as an adult or something if you're worried he'll try to do it himself as a teen. It really helps people to remember that you were a person and not just an ideal paragon of humanity. It helps those left to feel like they know you better when they can hear all about you and not just the best parts. (Trust me, I have experience with this.)   \n\n\nSecondly, I'd also share what you know about your heritage. You have no idea what family will still be around when he comes to an age where that will matter to him. I only got there in my 30's and there are so many holes in what I know of my family beyond my grandparents. Share any customs or traditions you had that were important to you. It can help to not feel so alone if you have a larger history to feel connected to. Do the same with what you may know about his mother's side of the family.   \n\n\nFinally, while I know you are doing what is best for your child, your Mom (Mum?) is scared of losing you and then possibly losing contact with her grandson after losing her son. It's understandable, even if you're doing the right thing. Maybe, when you make the legal arrangements for your Aunt to get custody, make sure there are stipulations for making sure the other side of your family (as well as any family on the mother's side) will still get to have visitation rights. People can change after a death and it can cause rifts and issues that aren't there before. And make sure she knows you are making sure she will always be able to see her grandson, even if she isn't raising him. That may help allay her fears. Always, always, always, make sure your wishes are clear and stated in a legally binding way if it's important to you that they are definitely followed. (Trust me, I also have experience with this, unfortunately. )  \n\n\nI hope this helps you with making your preparations. I wish you all the peace and love on your journey.",

Do the same with what you may know about his mother&#39;s side of the family.   </p>\n\n<p>Finally, while I know you are doing what is best for your child, your Mom (Mum?) is scared of losing you and then possibly losing contact with her grandson after losing her son. It&#39;s understandable, even if you&#39;re doing the right thing. Maybe, when you make the legal arrangements for your Aunt to get custody, make sure there are stipulations for making sure the other side of your family (as well as any family on the mother&#39;s side) will still get to have visitation rights. People can change after a death and it can cause rifts and issues that aren&#39;t there before. And make sure she knows you are making sure she will always be able to see her grandson, even if she isn&#39;t raising him. That may help allay her fears. Always, always, always, make sure your wishes are clear and stated in a legally binding way if it&#39;s important to you that they are definitely followed. (Trust me, I also have experience with this, unfortunately. )  </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps you with making your preparations. I wish you all the peace and love on your journey.</p>\n</div>",

There are other documents that the lawyer can do that will give guardianship before death, and that's the best way.  If not, the hospital or other authorities will let the next of kin take the kid.  Weeks later when the will is read, that's done in a lawyers office, not court.  Then someone has to petition the court.  Weeks more pass... and the judge is more likely to let the kid stay where they're at so as not to disturb the status quo more.\n\nSo OP, please... get with a lawyer as soon as possible, and have the guardianship assigned to the aunt immediately, before your time here ends.  That doesn't meant the kid is taken away from you, just that it creates the status quo while you're still alive.",
