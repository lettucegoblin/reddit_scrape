She ought to at least give your money back and sincerely apologize for stealing from you. Your mom&#39;s unwillingness to take your side is troubling.</p>\n</div>",

And if your mom thinks it is okay, than your mom can be the one who gets you tickets for you and your friend so that you can go have a good time. I dont know why your mom is enabling your sister to kill herself. But, a little tiny bit of e coli in one of her coke straws is going to result in a big puffy area on her face and possibly a scar from having to drain it. E.coli infections from snorting coke through a dirty straw or through money is pretty common if you ask a ER doctor in a city. Maybe she will learn her lesson sooner than later.",

I live with my parents and my sister, Joanne, 23f. Joanne has a cocaine habit and she claims its normal in her job and it's just the lifestyle of cheffing, yada yada. My parents seem to be ignoring it since Joanne pays her rent on time and keeps to herself when she's in the house and doesn't cause many problems. \n\nI'm a college student on a government grant, and I'm in college Monday to Friday up until 5/6pm, working isn't really an option for me right now, so I don't go out much and I spend all my money on college supplies. Joanne doesn't seem to understand this and is always asking to borrow money and what not. I always say no because it works out that I only have \u20ac40 every week to spend on college stuff and travel to college. \n\nI got a Christmas bonus on my grant and I ended up deciding to book tickets for a small ish local gig that's next week. I booked two, one for me and one for my best friend because her birthday is the same day and she loves the type of music, it was meant to be a surprise for her. I had told Joanne about this on one of her \"good days\" because I was genuinely excited to finally do something and live the college student lifestyle for a night. \n\nThe tickets were digital, on an account shared with my parents. Joanne had asked for the login telling them that she wanted to book tickets to something, but she was lying and used it to sell my tickets for drug money. I didn't find out until I had gotten the email to confirm that the tickets were sent to someone else and I was really confused at first. I checked and they were sent to someone I know Joanne knows. \n\nI went straight to her when she got home and asked what the fuck she did, and she tried lying but I showed her proof it went to someone she knows and told her I wanted my money back then and there. She told me it was gone already. I lost my mind and started yelling at her, because it wasn't fair. \n\nMy mom was just in from work and I was screaming at my sister who was crying at that point saying she was sorry and she didn't know it would upset me this much. My mom got involved and told me to keep my voice down and we'll talk about it, and I told her to shut up and stay out of it. I ended up saying something along the lines of \"why is it fair that you get to do this to me when I've never even drank alcohol or smoked weed, why does the cokewhore get to be the golden child bit not me?\". \n\nMy mom stepped in and put a stop to it then and there, my sister had started screaming back at me for what I called her. My mom said that was out of line and she just made a mistake. I told my mom her mistake cost me the only night out ill have been able to have all year so she should hear what I have to say about it. My mom thinks I was in the wrong for what I said, and my sister won't even look at me even though its been 3 days and I've tried apologising.

        "body": "/u/GigTicket10294 Op, This is the answer. Though I disagree with filing a police report, you do need to sit down with the parents. This isn't about the tickets this is about the life of the person who used to be your sister. You are in a dangerous situation.  Not physically, but emotionally and developmentally. You are living in a toxic environment. \n\nThere's nothing wrong, in my opinion, with occasionally doing cocaine. But when it starts to affect the lives of people around you especially through stealing that is serious problem that has developed. It is not part of the industry your sister is in, she just works with a group of people who frequently do cocaine, who by chance happen to work in restaurants. They may or may not be addicts themselves. Your sister has crossed the line. \n\n\nYou need to lock yourself away from her for your own good. Though you are 18 you are essentially still a child and still have a lot of developing to do. So controlling the situations affect on you will help this scar heal properly. You'll sit down with your parents and make your feelings known. And make it known that you're going to be locking yourself up from her until she gets help and until you see you improvement. From what it sound your parents will do nothing about this but it's important that it is made known. By doing nothing you are an enabler. You will not be an enabler, though your parents will continue to be. \n\nI've known many many people who live their lives this way. I am not exaggerating as I make these following statements. This is excluding alcohol. Most people who have crossed the line into addiction in my own life have died of overdoses. A couple have gone to jail for armed robbery. Side note I recently saw one of those guys who was a close friend of mine at the grocery store. He was with his mother and looked 30 years older than me though he is 5 years younger. One suicide after being sentence to prison for killing a woman while driving high on pills. Most recently, the last one to fall was a couple years ago. He was murdered in his own basement. Struggle with drugs his whole life. He'd come and go, be clean or lost again. A detail about this man you might find interesting is he was a brilliant chef. \n\nI hung out with a strange crew for a man who didn't really do drugs but on the rarest of occasions years apart. But I know how all those stories end... I've taken a final pause for a couple minutes while writing this to think of there's anyone I know who has stolen for drugs who has survived, unscathed. I sincerely cannot think of anybody. So I'll just say maybe I don't know that some of them have stolen. \n\nThese were all good people with good hearts. They just got sick. It sounds like a cliche but it's not. I knew them. They were good kind people. \n\nNow here you are in a situation I've seen so many times. Offer the help you can, but protect yourself. Don't let anything be taken from you.",

Now I say this because as long as you can manage your own shit, you're fine. But she's coming down the line of starting to steal from her own siblings. It only gets worse from here if family continues to enable her, simply because she pays rent on time and keeps to herself.  This isn't a \"rail off a stripper's ass\" bucket list shit, this is a habit she's starting to jeproadize relationships over. Not good.\n\nEventually, she won't. She'll be so far down the Scarface rabbit hole, that she will lose herself if she's allowed to continue. She will fuel that habit by any means neccessary. Including continued theft, losing her job, and worst case, prostitution. She needs help. But not from you, OP. She's gotta pick it for herself, and nobody's gonna convince her otherwise.
