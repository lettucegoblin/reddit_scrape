The best thing you can do is encourage your daughter to talk with him. Maybe involve a professional to help guide her in the appropriate way to do so and to support him in understanding how her diagnosis could (emphasis on could) affect him and their relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly important to keep in mind that as a person with ASPD your daughter does not experience the world the way you do. Simply by her admission that she fears she would lose him, that indicates that he has value and importance to her that is significant. It may not be love in the way you or her boyfriend understand or experience it, but that is what she is capable of. ASPD is wildly misunderstood as it is, and it seems that your daughter is able to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Again, if she isn\u2019t actively a threat, you shouldn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis without her consent.\n\nYes, her boyfriend deserves to know this about your daughter if he were to marry her but they\u2019ve had a stable relationship for over a year already. If you were to tell her boyfriend and subsequently end that relationship that is no different than if your daughter had any other diagnosis (medical or psychiatric).

So long as she is not a danger to herself or others (specifically her boyfriend) it is not your place to tell him. The best thing you can do is encourage your daughter to talk with him. Maybe involve a professional to help guide her in the appropriate way to do so and to support him in understanding how her diagnosis could (emphasis on could) affect him and their relationship.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s incredibly important to keep in mind that as a person with ASPD your daughter does not experience the world the way you do. Simply by her admission that she fears she would lose him, that indicates that he has value and importance to her that is significant. It may not be love in the way you or her boyfriend understand or experience it, but that is what she is capable of. ASPD is wildly misunderstood as it is, and it seems that your daughter is able to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Again, if she isn\u2019t actively a threat, you shouldn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis without her consent.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, her boyfriend deserves to know this about your daughter if he were to marry her but they\u2019ve had a stable relationship for over a year already. If you were to tell her boyfriend and subsequently end that relationship that is no different than if your daughter had any other diagnosis (medical or psychiatric). You must also be willing and able to handle any and all of the potential fallout from your choice. Just because she cannot empathize or love the way you do does not mean she cannot value her boyfriend or interpret this situation as a betrayal. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot emphasize this enough: he should definitely know but it cannot come from you without her explicit permission.</p>\n</div>",

You understand how dangerous your daughter can be and you are at a crossroad of either not saying anything, and potentially having someone becoming totally crushed and devastated for the rest of their life, or just maybe, they may live a long and happy life together, so saying something may destroy that future they may have, or save them. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My advice, be careful with your words, have that conversation,with him OR your daughter, but be very selective with how you say it, don&#39;t just say,  &quot;Hey bud my daughter is a diagnosed sociopath she did a lot of fucked up shit, and lacks empathy and warmth.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>But do inform him carefully of how your daughter is, maybe just tell him about her diagnosis, OR just tell your daughter it would be responsible for her to tell him herself. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know normally this isn&#39;t appropriate, its very awkward, especially in my experience, when a parent of a friend / significant other bad mouths their child to you.

Didnt realize it before but she would get really angry within seconds and refuse to let it go even after calming down.

But wait, doesn't she have a significant enough relationship with the father to confide her deepest secrets in him? So now she isn't completely devoid of emotion?\n\nThen there's the case of what would happen if an actual parent (unlike the majority of NTA advocates here) betrayed their child like this. You think after potentially breaking up her 18-MONTH relationship - omg how are they not married yet - she would ever let her dad in again? All for the \"greater good\" right, because now he's guaranteed to never have a part in any of her relationships again.\n\nI don't have her disorder and if either of my parents even tried going behind my back to tell my spouse something about me the closest they'd ever get to speaking to me again would be my voicemail.",

She was discharged from the general hospital to a mental health facility when she was able, and things continued to go well so she was discharged fully after around three weeks (we are talking about 6 or so weeks in some sort of hosptial). </p>\n\n<p>The family did everything right for ages, dad or someone was always home with her and the baby, and she was followed up for a long time by mental health services in the community because she still exhibited a few signs of psychosis despite presenting, on the whole, really well (she has &quot;mask like&quot;, or latent and reduced facial reactivity, latency of verbal response).</p>\n\n<p>Eventually she was at a point where, since she had exhibited such good care for her kid and had not had any incidence of physical harm or anything, services had lesser contact (still pretty heavily involved), and they needed to start exposing her to normalcy in her relationship with bub. For her, this was talking them for a walk to the park and back without dad or anyone else, I think they went once a week (some clinicians were still a bit worried about her and the introduction of any changes to her life were taken very slowly).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway so it&#39;s the week before they planned to remove services completely because she had been without incident the whole &quot;unsupervised&quot; time and so there was really no indication to have such committed involvement from community mental health teams (pretty sure they have a period that they&#39;re funded for after which point they have to disengage anyway), and the team gets a call, she had gone to the train station between her home and the park and expressed capgras delusions to a stranger (thought that her husband had been replaced by an imposter trying to make her raise the evil kid, incorporated that health services to be aides on that mission), and then took her child&#39;s hand and  jumped in front of a train.</p>\n\n<p>edit: grammar</p>\n</div>",

If she has control and is able to behave appropriately, then she might actually do better than &quot;loving,&quot; lazy sots.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "^ This. My father is a sociopath, the narcissist kind. I won't get into details about my childhood, but they were so bad that I never told a word of it to anyone until I was 23 because it was so heinous that I thought no one would believe me. Im 28 now and I still fear for my mom and my sisters' lives. \n\nThere is no safe play for OP. If he doesn't tell him, the fiancee's life will be ruined. Burned to the ground. That much is inevitable. This goes for his family, their future children, and almost anyone closely associated with them. BUT it might not blow up until OP has passed. (Sociopaths can keep up appearances fpr a long time)\n\nIf he does tell him and she finds out, he'll have a metaphorical as well as literal bullseye on his head. His only hope would be that his daughter wouldn't retaliate out of fear of embarrasament, which cam be overwhelming for them. But if at any point she feels she has nothing to lose, things get bad. And when I say bad, I mean the type of thing that if you saw it in a movie, it would scar you, let alone witnessing it in person. \n\nIt's terrifying. It's literally almost indistinguishable from a pit bull with rabies. You've had it since it was a pup, and you're great friends. It would never hurt you, until it changes. And I'll never forget what that looks like. I tried to defend my mom one day, and my dad looked at me. The dad that raised me, taught me how to throw a baseball, \"loved\" and protected me. The guy that every girl adored and every man respected. He was gone. He was someone else, and whoever he was, he wanted me dead. I wasn't his son anymore. I was an obstacle. What happened during the next decade isn't meant for a forum like this, but I can tell you that no one could ever be ready for what happens. And it will shatter you, for a long time, if not forever. \n\nOP, if you truly respect this guy, please, tell him, but never let it get back to your daughter that you were the one that told him. And for God's sake, and the sake of your family, watch her. Do as much research as possible, and pay attention to every last detail of every move she makes. Try as hard as you can to separate your emotions from your judgement. Please.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>^ This. My father is a sociopath, the narcissist kind. I won&#39;t get into details about my childhood, but they were so bad that I never told a word of it to anyone until I was 23 because it was so heinous that I thought no one would believe me. Im 28 now and I still fear for my mom and my sisters&#39; lives. </p>\n\n<p>There is no safe play for OP. If he doesn&#39;t tell him, the fiancee&#39;s life will be ruined. Burned to the ground. That much is inevitable. This goes for his family, their future children, and almost anyone closely associated with them. BUT it might not blow up until OP has passed. (Sociopaths can keep up appearances fpr a long time)</p>\n\n<p>If he does tell him and she finds out, he&#39;ll have a metaphorical as well as literal bullseye on his head. His only hope would be that his daughter wouldn&#39;t retaliate out of fear of embarrasament, which cam be overwhelming for them. But if at any point she feels she has nothing to lose, things get bad. And when I say bad, I mean the type of thing that if you saw it in a movie, it would scar you, let alone witnessing it in person. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s terrifying.

        "body": "Similar here, I have CPTSD from years of childhood trauma and as a result have a lot of trouble regulating my emotions as an adult. The way my therapists explained it was that my normal years of learning how to feel and manage emotions and respond to other people's emotions were so effed up and I spent so long disassociating that I didn't learn the proper tools in dealing with them, and now it's a lot harder to gain those tools as an adult. Often time I still feel it's easier to just not feel anything, because it's more efficient and productive and less painful. It also doesn't help that society often praises lack of emotional response (especially at school and work) as more mature, so it's served me well. So it's a constant uphill battle to WANT to get better and keep working on something when it's hard to see the benefits day to day.\n\nIt is crazy to me though how often people think having muted emotions means it's a Jekyl and Hyde situation and I'm going to snap. Like you said, the only person I've ever been a danger to is myself. Not having strong emotional responses doesn't mean I don't have morals or ethics. I may not understand some of them on an intuitive level as the average person does, but I believe in them and thus I follow them. I don't see how having strong emotions make someone magically more likely to be ethical.\n\nIt's partly due to the above that I've never told my family about it. I went to therapy after I turned 18 and all my parents know is that there was some trauma I needed to process. I can't imagine my parents learning the worst parts of it, not actually understanding it, and then turning around and telling other people in my life about it. I truly think the OP doesn't understand his daughter as much as he thinks he does, but maybe I'm too biased. I've been lucky to find a partner with a very similar history as me, and we don't hold this against each other. Actually my relationships have always been one of the top reasons I've WANTED to get therapy and learn to improve, and I'd be furious if someone messed with them out of a misguided sense that they somehow knew better.",

Lastly sociopaths are far more inclinded to avoid people than manipulate or hurt them, as they are many times more likely to be the victim of violence than they are likely to cause violent harm to others.\nWhen you are done trying to be edgy educate yourself on the subject so next time you make something up for someone looking for advice your lies will at least have basis in reality instead of this fictional BS you made up.</p>\n</div>",

It also doesn't help that society often praises lack of emotional response (especially at school and work) as more mature, so it's served me well. \n\nI completely agree. I understand that I _should_ want to work on my issues and feel more but it feels like the negatives outweigh the positives.

In fact, often he's a little too forgiving IMO, as he tends to react based on how a person is making him feel in the moment, so if a generally shitty person who has hurt him in the past does something nice to him, he'll be good with them again, until they start being an asshole to him again at which point he'll get mad again, then they'll be nice and he'll be friends again...rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd from what I've read, most \"sociopaths\" are like that (scare quote because that's not really a diagnosis anymore and can refer to a number of diagnoses). Most of their abusive and antisocial behavior is a more immediate reaction, not some movie-esque calculated revenge shit. They may also engage in \"splitting,\" or seeing people as all good or all bad, but just because they see you as all bad doesn't mean they're going to engage in some horrible revenge against you. They might cut you out of their lives over petty slights (though so would half of this forum, if people's advice is to be believed), but they're not going to murder you in your sleep.\n\nI do think the fiance does deserve to know if this is an accurate diagnosis (and if she was really diagnosed right at 18 and it hasn't affected her adult life, it might not be, though of course the OP would know that far better than me), because it will potentially affect their life together.
