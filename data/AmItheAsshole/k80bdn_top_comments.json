His little stunt with the dental trays was him TELLING you he wasn&#39;t planning on being straight with you, and smart you listened. Many of us could learn from your example. </p>\n\n<p>By all means, reach out to the girl he&#39;s been seeing behind your back - if he&#39;s been telling her he&#39;s single, then she is just another victim of his little games and likely has NO idea what he&#39;s been up to. You&#39;d want to know the truth if you were in her position, I think. Be prepared for her to be angry, hurtful, or nasty, but give her the truth and then walk away and let it go. Don&#39;t take it upon yourself to convince her, just hand her the gift of reality and let her do what she wants with it. Walk away and enjoy your freedom from this mess.</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My guinea pig had surgery this week to remove a tumor. He desperately wants to chew on his stitches but can&#39;t because he&#39;s wearing a body sock (couldn&#39;t keep the cone of shame on him).When he gets frustrated he does what I call the angry butt dance where he hops around in circles and then checks to see if he can get at his stitches yet. My bouncing guinea pig is like OP&#39;s emotions and trying to chew the stitches is the urge to let BF back in.
