He has spent his entire life waking up for school (at least since kindergarten, but likely since before then if he went to any sort of preschool). We are living through a trying and unprecedented time in history. Kids often struggle to get to sleep, so the extra time later in the morning can make a huge difference for them in terms of development and mental health. He should be able to take this time to rest anyway. Instead, you have irreparably destroyed something that has long been a creative outlet for him, and something that he was proud and excited to share with you at that. I have no doubt that next time he has something he is excited about, he will hide it from you at all costs for fear of you destroying it again.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA- why does it even matter if he\u2019s up at 7? Plenty of research has shown that kids do better at school when they get to sleep in later. He has spent his entire life waking up for school (at least since kindergarten, but likely since before then if he went to any sort of preschool). We are living through a trying and unprecedented time in history. Kids often struggle to get to sleep, so the extra time later in the morning can make a huge difference for them in terms of development and mental health. He should be able to take this time to rest anyway. Instead, you have irreparably destroyed something that has long been a creative outlet for him, and something that he was proud and excited to share with you at that. I have no doubt that next time he has something he is excited about, he will hide it from you at all costs for fear of you destroying it again. You have betrayed your own child\u2019s trust because he is nine years old and his body needed rest.</p>\n</div>",

For starters, when you discipline your kids, you need to let them know what behavior you find unacceptable, why that behavior is unacceptable, and what the consequences will be for continuing the behavior BEFORE you jump straight to punishment. In a household with emotionally mature parents, it\u2019s pretty common to start this conversation by saying something like, \u201cTimmy, I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve been sleeping much later than usual recently. I want to talk to you about that, but, before we do, is anything bothering you that\u2019s making it hard to sleep at night?\u201d This shows your child that his feelings and well-being are important to you, more so than an arbitrary wake up time. Sure, waking up independently is an important skill,  but I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if he\u2019s struggling emotionally during this unprecedented period of social isolation. \n\nNow let\u2019s move on to WHY you are a massive A-hole based on your punishment of choice. For starters, a month off the computer is a pretty intense punishment, and I could maybe see it being reasonable if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a Pandemic; however, I\u2019m guessing the computer is the only way a 10 year old has to interact with anyone outside the immediate family. Social interaction is important for everyone, particularly children, and, in taking away that form of communication, you\u2019ve isolated him entirely from the support of his peers. \n\nFurthermore, you destroyed your child\u2019s favorite thing, something he worked on for a year, and shared with you. That\u2019s special, OP. The problem is that headed into his teenage years, he\u2019s going to be less likely to share anything with you that he actually cares about out of the fear that you will destroy the very things he holds most dear in your anger. My mom loved to take away or ruin my favorite things, and I gradually stopped sharing anything with her in my teens because I knew she couldn\u2019t be trusted. If you don\u2019t put serious effort into repairing things with your children and working on your temper (preferably with a qualified therapist), it\u2019s likely that you will, at best, have a very strained relationship with your child through middle and high school. Why would he trust someone who behaves this way, especially once the issues become things like sex, drugs, college, etc.? As a final note, it\u2019s never wise to punish someone in anger, and I hope you take that to heart.",

Would you have done the same if this was a painting your son had been working on for a year? Or a novel they had written? Just because it\u2019s a game doesn\u2019t mean any less hard work went into it. Especially when they\u2019ve been working on it for a year! And Minecraft is a difficult game to build in too!
