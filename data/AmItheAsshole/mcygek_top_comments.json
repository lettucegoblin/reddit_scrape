When I took him for a regular vet visit just hearing a dog in the building sent him hiding behind me and shaking like a leaf. Then he was on guard for a couple of days when he heard the neighbor's dogs which he ignored entirely up to that point. He had been losing fur, getting sores on his face, never relaxed. The day we moved we thought we'd have behavioral issues with him being in a new place for the first time in 11 years. He immediately curled up in bed with us and melted. Within a month he was a brand new cat. He has guinea pig siblings now but he's indifferent to them lol.",

It started with his hate for plastic bags so we desperately tried to switch to paper/reusable.\n\nThen it was when we cleaned \"his\" cat tree and he saw us. \n\nHe hated an ex of mine and would poop RIGHT in his path every morning and it stopped when my ex moved out.\n\nThe only suggestion one vet had was put him on antidepressants (like a human brand, too) for stress. I didn't even know cats could take human meds. We tried and it just made him lethargic and hate-poop even more so we stopped. \n\nHe's an indoor/outdoor cat too (he goes in our fenced yard to sun himself and use the restroom and doesn't go far). I never had a cat that starts fights with EVERYTHING. The dogs stay away but he will try and fight squirrels, my cat, other cats, skunks, raccoons.

(I'm 31 now) She was raised around dogs (I had one from the ages of 11-26) and then I got another rescue when she was an adult, but still quite active, and I made it work. Despite this, I knew that as long as she was alive, I would NEVER get another cat or even another dog (besides the one I already had) Her confort was of the utmost priority. I was abused horribly as a child, and she was there to witness part of that. It's kind of sweet (but a sad situation) to see us both AFTER the abuse, because we started off both being terribly afraid of men and she especially thrived after we got out of there. She was my mini me, and when I would have panic attacks and cry into my bedsheets, she would get on my back and curl up, sitting there steadily until I calmed down. She was also there comforting the dog I mentioned earlier, as he passed away. She was so intuitive and kind. We did everything together. And suffering from a lot of mental health issues and trauma from the abuse, I have been reading in a journal I had been writing for years, different things like, \"Eleanor is the only one that understands me.\" \"Eleanor is the only one that's 100% on my side\" and I wish I could go on and on of our exploits and funny stories of us together, but I'm already going way off topic already. In her last three years of life, she lived with chronic kidney failure and I had to give her IV fluids almost everyday. She was almost as energetic as she was when she was a kitten. I do suggest that if your guy starts to get sick, you take him to a cat specialist.

(Thank you by the way. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this and sharing her story just now has been so therapeutic) I'm so glad it worked out. Focus your attention and time on Sparky so you won't have any regrets. Also take lots of photos, and videos of things that Sparky does regularly, even his meowing or stuff like that. I promise it will help when the day comes. (but of course it won't happen for a very long time! I like to have this mentality!) \n\nIf you have read the novel I wrote and you want to, here is what my cat looks like.

My first cat had met the dogs and didn\u2019t really care, but my second cat hadn\u2019t ever seen a dog.\n\nI really think he thought she was a really weird cat. He approached her and started purring really loud, which he always does when he\u2019s super happy. He loves meeting new cats and people, and always introduces himself with a purr. My old girl looked at him and started growing, and before I could pull him away he *purred even louder*. I honestly think he thought she was purring, he seemed super pleased with the interaction.\n\nAfter that he wanted to cuddle her, but she was grumpy. I didn\u2019t have to worry about her attacking him because she didn\u2019t really have a lot of teeth left, but I kept shooing him away for her comfort.

How much of the animosity would actually be subdued by a proper introduction? My guess is next to nothing. The cat is used to being the only pet and is guaranteed to act out when OP and her SO start giving the new dog the attention it needs (especially if it\u2019s a puppy, Jesus Christ). Furthermore, I think the fact that this experiment was so poorly planned suggests that the real introduction will be just as unplanned when the time comes.

We ended up with our #6 little girl--\"Rosie\" when I saw an older man in a wheelchair sitting outside of our local Target.  He looked rather upset, so I went over and asked if I could help. Turned out that the small white terrier mix he had in his lap, was one he had found in the street days before.  as he was moving Jan 1st 100 miles away and had a service dog he was hoping to find a good home for her.  I looked over at my husband who just smiled. So I asked if we could take her. The gentleman began crying,smiling and thanking God all at the same time. As I carried her to our SUV my husband noticed she was missing one front leg.  Or as our vet calls her--she is a Tripod.  The leg IS there--just never grew,so is super tiny. She tho does not seem to notice it as an issue. We went\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nstraight to our vets office--had her scanned--no chip. She had been loved at one time--some had her spayed. But we had her nails done and all shots done. Seems she is 8 to 9 years old has cataracts and TERRIBLE teeth. That will be taken care of next week. So her breath will be much better. Our other dogs? Excepted her without a problem. Considering that 2 of them have been with us for nearly 13 years-- 2 others for 11 another for 4, I was a bit concerned. Only difference is that our tiny girl \"dolly\" the 5 pound MOM of the group has yet to wash her face and ears. A nightly routine she does on the others. Tho is DID take her nearly 9 months before she did so for \"Odie\" the youngest who was a throw away puppy. HE is the only one who was not an adult--(other than our 1st--I bought from one of my patients when he was 7 weeks old. She was returning him after just one day to the breeder). We never thought we would have 6 dogs--actually teased my youngest sister for having so many.  Yet seems when people learned I was a soft touch, have the time and a husband who is ever so willing to help. Good thing I do not have MORE room--or I would need to hire help as I would end up adopting every dog without a family! My husband? He cooks the boneless chicken breast and the brown rice in that water with vegies for them.  Somehow they have learned to tell time. He feeds them at 11:30 and 3:30. And yes--they do have kibble available whenever they wish.  Of the 6--only ONE is overweight.  The one we have had since he was 7 weeks old. Looks like a little tank. And HE is the only one who is willing to go on walks with me. Our last dog Coco a yorkie lived until she was 23--shocked all of us.  My husband took her death harder than that of his parents. Could be part of the reason he gives SO much to these dogs that needs us.",
