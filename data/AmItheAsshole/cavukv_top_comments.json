Well TB would often raid the fridge at night and eat a bunch of food. FM didnt really mind, she understood a growing teen boy can eat like a beast. Problem was, he ate all the junk food: desserts,  candies, chips, etc. She wanted him to ear a healthy diet and wouldn't mind of he raised the fridge for fruits, veggies, and the like. \n\nSo, my mom, F, and FM devised a plan: since they couldnt get through to him with words they would use his stomach. They made a big bowl of chocolate pudding enhanced with a box of chocolate laxatives and left it in the fridge. TB ate majority of it that night and the next day his bowels had a clearance sale, everything had to go. At the time they laughed and he learned his lesson but now, as an adult with a nursing background, my mom feels guilty knowing they could have seriously hurt him with that stunt.",

Its outrigth bullying! </p>\n\n<p>I remember as feeling such around age 14, and now at age 23, I understand what i didn&#39;t understand then. It had nothing to do with my parents comments, and it was merely an excuse for my own behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Its good for parents to push their childs boundaries, prepare them for contemporary social norms. Its either them or other peoples kids. And kids wouldn&#39;t be as light hearted as daddy and wont have mommy bear there to protect her cubs.</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>People miss the part where he said the peppers are for his dad and sister. So the family knows he doesnt normally spice his food up. He also has this post admitting it. Sure, if OP was doing this to a stranger or coworker, they could probably get away with it as long as they weren&#39;t out there admitting it to people. But in the context of this story where the brother would be the one suing, it&#39;s more likely they would get in trouble. The brother could even admit to eating the pizza and if the brother got sick or went to the hospital (my family also grows ghost peppers and use them in a variety of ways, crying for an hour is not common at all) trouble for OP. Not to mention if OP is a legal adult and the brother is a minor.</p>\n</div>",
