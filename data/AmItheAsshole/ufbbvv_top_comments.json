And people should hold their tongues!\n\nMy husband & I struggled with infertility.  It was nearly 7 years before we were able to have a baby.

Whether you&#39;re in your 30s, 40s, or 50s to have children that&#39;s up to you. </p>\n\n<p>So get your bread OP and keep counting those dollars!</p>\n</div>",

We could have tried other more invasive fertility treatments, and my insurance would have covered it, but I did not want to.

I have the philosophy that if someone can\u2019t fix or achieve what you\u2019re pointing out/asking about in 30 seconds or less, don\u2019t say shit. And idk why it even has to be said to the general public but don\u2019t freaking talk to/ask a woman about her pregnancy unless SHE brings it up. There are literally so many things concerning pregnancy that are hard to deal with, uncomfortable to talk about, and even the fact that she just might not WANT to discuss her changing body, growing a human and destroying herself in the process, the emotions and hormone changes involved, and not to mention the multitude of things that could go wrong in any pregnancy that she just may not want to think about much less talk about.</p>\n</div>",
