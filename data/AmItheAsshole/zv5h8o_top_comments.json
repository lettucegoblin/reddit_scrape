Toilet paper.  Tampons, Vagisil. Hemorrhoid cream. KY jelly...the list goes on.</p>\n</div>",

It's not your house, lady.  It's not even your boyfriend's house.  It's not even your boyfriend's family's house (love to see her pull this on his family, though!).  Express your shock and horror to your boyfriend after you leave, if you want, but my goodness, the gall of this woman.\n\nCould OP have been more gracious?  Yeah, sure.  Did OP need to be gracious?  Not with that kind of provocation.\n\nI do think that OP's BF is likely more upset by her inviting the drama queen to leave.  (At least I hope so!)  He might not be an asshole; he might just be like a lot of people, easily embarrassed by something this socially awkward and confrontational.  Too many people take the idea of not rocking the boat way too far.  They become convinced that they have to just ignore bad behavior, both to be good guests, and good hosts.  It's stupid!  But it can take some people a lot of personal growth to realize this and break away from that social conditioning.\n\nOP's best course of action at this point is to sit him down, and explain that she is really not under any obligation to be yelled at and insulted for... well, for anything in her house, really. But especially not for something so innocuous.  The guest is NOT always right.  There are social expectations of guests and how they should behave, as well.  A host does not have to just tolerate any old behavior from a guest, and especially not behavior like that.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll admit, I have to wonder about the accuracy of the freak-out, too.  But, then, I&#39;ve also learned over time not to think things like, &quot;who would DO that?&quot; (like, literally come out into the room, brandish the offending item, and be so hysterically upset that they&#39;re both shrieking AND gasping for breath????), because somewhere out there, there ARE people who will, apparently.  And I am just fortunate not to run into those people.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate -- even assuming this was a less histrionic incident than described, the point at which a GUEST, let alone someone who is the newest to the social group, would berate the host over something like this... that is the point at which the host is perfectly within their rights to ask them to leave.

Express it to the sorta-BIL out of concern for him (dude, your gf is psycho, are you ok?), Express it to the bf (your brother is dating a psycho, wtf is going on? Aren&#39;t you concerned here?). </p>\n\n<p>How any of this is falling on OP at all makes me question the veracity of the story. But then I remember the level of crazy people I personally know and have witnessed with my own eyes as actually existing. OP may want to take a look at the family she is associating herself with and be certain this is the future she wants.</p>\n</div>",
