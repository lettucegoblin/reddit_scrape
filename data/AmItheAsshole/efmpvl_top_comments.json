You conducted a social experiment and the results were completely what you expected, and then your wife has the gall to not only try and demean that when it's a completely valid point, but then say that it's a mean prank? What's the worse action, constantly not including someone in holidays or general family events or doing this? If I were still with my bitch of an ex I would have done this in a heartbeat to prove the same point.\n\nYour wife's family sucks, point blank. I don't have advice to give you because anything I say would be interpreted as \"hurrrrrr break up with her.\" But in all honesty, your wife let you do this, then bitches when you call them on it afterwards? Even if you're TA for doing this, she's switching sides and taking her family over her husband.\n\nHot take: *Once you are married, your husband is your closest relative and loved one. It is no longer your family, and defending them to death and putting you on blast is a sign of her fucking letting them do the same shit.*\n\nI'm glad I'm not married because I don't have to deal with this nonsense. I don't even care if you're somewhat TA (in some people's minds) for trying this, if her family doesn't care to try and talk to you, *they are the assholes*. All you did in my mind was make a strong point. Do they have anything to stand on? Do they think it's unfair, even though they literally treated your twin like they treated you while they generally give favorable treatment to him? Does she have any explanation? Has anyone, at any fucking point, said that they like you and were hurt by this action? My guess is no, and them being mad is a convenient excuse to just absolve all blame on their part.\n\nI've never liked a significant other's parents. I probably never will. Somehow, it's shocking that I'm dating someone for *them and their personality over having an ideal relationship with their parents.* Just don't spend time with them anymore. They've proven time and again that you're not worthwhile to have around to them in their mind, and they're not going to change.\n\nIn short, why care? Your in-law family doesn't care. Your wife doesn't care. You don't care. What's the fucking point? That it's the holidays? Fuck that. They sound like assholes. Don't go back and if your wife continues to bitch then I don't really know. I wouldn't marry someone if I didn't like their parents, because tbh, that's *not what a relationship is about. You don't like me? Fine, you're entitled to think that way. I'm also entitled to not talk to you because you make me feel that way.* Your brother should be backing you on this and helping you talk to your wife.\n\nAm I going to say that you need to divorce? Nope. Am I going to say that you shouldn't have to deal with her family if they're rude to you? Yep. She should be helping you integrate, not just letting it fester, then letting you make a very strong point, and THEN turning on you. Honestly dude, you sure do not know how to pick them whatsoever.\n\nDo whatever the fuck you want. I'm done calling people assholes here or there for being in stupid relationships. You might have married incorrectly. You might have not. Either way, even if someone calls you TA, your point stands above those accusations because *it has a visible and malleable effect, and yet no one has done anything to make you feel more welcome.* Like seriously? It's all your fault that her family doesn't try, then bitches when they get called on it? What kind of woman have you married?\n\nI don't even give a fuck anymore. NTA. Your in laws sound insane and I have no fucking idea why you'd even be in the same room as them, much less having to spend holidays with them if they're like this. Grow some balls and either tell your wife to figure out how you both want to handle this fucking catastrophe of a situation or divorce or just go to Christmas separate. The latter-most option is probably improbable, but like I said, if she isn't willing to defend and help you when you've made a palpable point like this, then she just ain't the one, chief. I don't have sympathy for you there if that's the case: you picked the wrong one, so drop it like it's hot and dab out of your in-law's house forever.\n\nAnd before anyone even comments or upvotes or downvotes, I just dont care. If you think it's acceptable for an entire side of what's supposed to be your \"family\" acting like this, then you're either severely out of touch with what we call \"reality\", or you just do not understand the dynamics of dealing with another family. Lots of them are dogshit and very few of them are genuinely welcoming.\n\nIdk, OP. I'd say run from the whole situation but it's your call to do whatever you want without being TA. They're all TA for ignoring you at every event and then pretending like that isn't the norm. Get out of here with that weak ass shit. NTA, and honestly, get out while you can.",

It really feels like (if this is real, obviously) the only reason to do this is to intentionally sabotage your relationship with your inlaws, and to some extent your wife's relationship with her family.\n\nConfronting everyone at once is a terrible idea. It gives each and every one of them the out of \"well I just didn't get an opportunity to talk to Steve that night, it was so busy and there was lots to do\", and also resent him for calling them out \"over nothing\". And the resentment will almost certainly cause them to ignore any potential soul searching they might have otherwise done.\n\nIt's also not always a great idea to confront people in the moment. Granted technically he didn't do that, he confronted them to next day, it was still in the heat of another event. Emotions are relatively high in the moment and it comes across as an attack and they get defensive. Approaching the problem at a different time and in a completely different context let's both of you see it as more of a problem that you can find a solution to. Even if it's completely their fault, letting them save a bit of face can build a ton of goodwill. It also shows that you aren't reacting rashly, you've given it time and put some thought in to it.\n\nHis wife playing diplomat would have been a much better option. She could even bring up the stunt if she wanted, though I don't know if it is the best idea. But using her puts a layer between him and the family that shields some resentment, and if it seems like it comes from the wife, not him, then there is not much anger to transfer to him. They also presumably know and like his wife, and are less likely to dismiss her out of hand.\n\nThe other, perhaps better option, would be to convert people one by one. Pick the person in the family that seems to like them the most. If that's no one, then at least someone who likes the wife a lot. Approach them one on one or with the wife, in a neutral context (meet for coffee or something). Bring up that it feels like there is distance between you and the family, ask them if they've noticed anything like that. Ideally have some concrete instances to share. Don't go in \"you all hate me\", use the classic \"when people in the family do X, it makes me feel Y\" formula. Again, be concrete.  Don't push the idea too hard, if they seem resistant, just ask them to pay attention at a family party and see if they notice anything. \n\nMaybe they'll agree with you up front, and you can talk about actionable ways to improve the status quo, which probably will include reaching out to other family members, using the cach\u00e9 of the one you have converted to make the introduction.\n\nMaybe they'll say it's your fault. Be prepared for that and listen and consider to what they say. Maybe they're wrong, and you just move on to another family member. Maybe there is some truth to what they say that could help you.\n\nMaybe they'll think it's silly but after the party they'll have seen what you are talking about and will be willing to help you.\n\nMaybe they'll disagree that there is a problem at all, in which case just move on to someone else. \n\nBut assuming you aren't the problem, and the family is more than 3 people, there is probably *someone* in the family that you can make a connection with. And when you do that, other people in the family are much more likely to recognize a problem because you are supported by someone in the \"in group\". And then that person's support bolsters the case for the next person...\n\nIt could fail, they could just all be unredeemable shitty people, but it would be a way better approach than what op did.",

If your partner is treated like this you don\u2019t say nothing to your family, you speak up on their behalf. The fact that she didn\u2019t notice that every event he is ignored and left out (a fact confirmed not only by him but by his brother). I would be mad at my partner for not sticking up for me and I would expect my partner to be mad for not sticking up for them.
