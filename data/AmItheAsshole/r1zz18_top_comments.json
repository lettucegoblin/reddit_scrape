I&#39;ve dealt with a few jerks over the years and have always put them in their place, but my favourite one was when a salesman kept hounding me mere days after my dad died wanting to &quot;talk to the owner of the house&quot; for some shit he was peddling to home owners. Each day I kept telling him to fuck off, it was inappropriate, the owner had just died but he kept coming back thinking I was lying. Finally one day I relented and gave him the number of the place he could find the owner of the house- the fucking morgue where his body was at that time. The salesman didn&#39;t come the next day.</p>\n</div>",
