I do ignore broad hints or shut down demands by telling them I&#39;m too busy.  I did point out to one woman that to make her an equivalent blanket to one I had just finished would mean I would have to charge \u00a32000.  Pikachu face, never asked again,</p>\n</div>",

I am used to family being that way, but a hotel valet was a new one on me.\n\nIt was a remote work situation; I had to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks for work, so I brought a little sewing machine and my current project to work on in the evenings.

I was tired from having just driven about 8 hours to get there, but whatever.\n\nThen she started telling me she used to be a cross-country runner and had all these running shirts she wanted made into a quilt and asked if I could do that.  I said something about how tee-shirt quilts are a real hassle to make but if she checked with the local quilting guild she can probalby find someone to make it. That wasn't good enough, she kept pestering me about how much it would cost for ME to make it for her, even after I'd said a couple times that I don't take commissions.\n\nFinally I got fed up and said, \"OK, I will make it for you - the cost is $10,000.00, with half due up front in cash and I get five years to complete the work.  Let me know when you have the cash and we can talk details.\"\n\nThat finally shut her down.  Thinking back...I should have complained.  She was REALLY persistent.
