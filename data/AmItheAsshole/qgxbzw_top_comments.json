Your sister doing her insecure Bridezilla freak-out I could sort of understand (she's surprised, and probably stressed out), at least initially, although I'd hope for an apology from her later. But your parents? 100% TAH. I get that this is your sister's big day, but them backing her up on this tells me immediately that they don't value you, your health, or your choices. They should be pleased for you, and proud of your healthy choices, not shaming you for them.\n\n Has this been a pattern of behavior from them, or is this a one-off situation? Because if it's the former, I'd give some serious thought to pressing pause on the relationship. Such a complete lack of support from them seems telling.",

I straight up started sobbing in the store. I'm ashamed to admit that I even accused her of stealing the limelight. \n\nWhat I didn't have was family that supported me in my silly tantrum. They immediately told me my sister worked hard for this and I need to get over myself. That's all the wake up call I needed. I got myself together (took a day), apologised to my sister and appreciated the fact that she was so excited about my wedding that she finally fought off her obesity. It honestly made my wedding so much better than if I had spent the entire day seething at her.\n\nI completely get where your sister is coming from. But this needs to be shut down pronto. Your family on the other hand are completely TA here. Them joining in on this bridezilla campaign is detrimental to both you and your sister.\n\nEdit: 100lbs??? Holy heck.

I don't live close to any of my family and don't post on social media so my family wasn't really aware of my weight loss. I did mention that I was making healthier choices but that's it. It's just that every time before that I've tried to lose weight it hasn't worked out so I didn't want anyone commenting on it.\n\nMy sister 26F got engaged last year and I'm super happy for her. Due to circumstances, the wedding had to be pushed back a little. It's happening a week from now and because I haven't seen everyone in so long I decided to come down two weeks earlier to help out and catch up. Well, when I came to see my family my sister freaked out upon seeing me. As it turns out she has gained a bit of weight not super noticeable to me she still looks great. But I think this is the first time in our lives that I'm smaller than her I've always been the \"fat sister\". She basically accused me of trying to upstage her and my parents are fully taking her side.

That they\u2019re used to seeing you as the person they look down on or use to feel better about themselves. And when you change that and take it away from them, sometimes those insecure people will try to drag you down to keep in the place they want you. You need to be prepared for that reaction from people you consider your support system, and have a plan on how you can combat that pressure and protect your mental health.\n\nAfter surgery it\u2019s recommended you go to support group meetings, so you can talk with others, hear their stories and find a supportive community.

No. Theoretically speaking here, if I simply got a nose job it's either because I wanted it (so not involving spiting anyone) or I truly am so mentally ill that I'd go under the knife/change my diet for a year purely to be \"better\" than someone which means I need a SHITLOAD of therapy to get over the obsession.\n\nIn OPs case she had no idea that her sister had gained weight, and it wasn't on her radar. So use your example. Say OP just got a nose job and now she has a nose that's cute and perfect for what OP wanted and she shows up, to find her sister had been in an accident. Sisters nose is broken meanwhile OPs nose is healing/healed and looking much better. The sister doesn't get to say \"you got a nose job to spite me!\" No. The accident was an accident- the nose job would've happened either way. The only way someone could do that to spite them is if the nose job were perceived to be \"better\" than sister's pre accident in which case... Excluding maybe a nose sister is openly self-conscious about - is completely subjective.\n\nAll this to say- as long as OP isn't trotting around praising herself for being \"sooo skinny\" or having \"such a cute nose!\", Or didn't stuff food down sister's throat/cut the brake lines OP wouldn't be the AH regardless of what choices she made that coincidentally coincided with a mistake/accident in the sisters life. It's not like her fiance is going to see OP and be like \"DANG! I GOT THE WRONG SISTER!\" Over details like this (Or if he does, he's not worth marrying lmao). It sucks but that's life.
