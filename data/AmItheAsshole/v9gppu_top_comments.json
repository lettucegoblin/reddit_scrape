        "body": "I thought from the title, you were going to be an AH. But you are absolutely not! \n\nFirst, I was upset hearing Kelly announce her pregnancy at Opal\u2019s celebration dinner. No one asked her if she was with child, but she felt the need to outshine the daughter she birthed. I guess I should not be surprised Kelly is a completely selfish person. Then she tried to slide in their \u201cbusy lives\u201d in conversation so you would know you have yet another child to care for. Personally, I think if she wasn\u2019t too busy to lay with this man, she shouldn\u2019t be too busy to raise that child. \n\nSo people think you are wrong for shutting her down right then and there. Well, they can think that. They\u2019re not the ones who have cleaned up her mess before. They\u2019re not the ones expected to do so again. It\u2019s easy for them to say you\u2019re favoring your first grandchild. Shut them down the way you shut Kelly down. You have one life to live and can\u2019t continue to keep living for others. You have done more than enough and deserve your freedom to do as you please, and whatever makes you happy. Don\u2019t allow anyone to guilt you. Any family that takes her side can offer their home and services to her. Simple as that.\n\nI was 16 when I discovered I was 4 months pregnant. It was too late for an abortion, but I\u2019m thankful everyday I found out so late or I would have terminated him out of fear of my mother. I had my son at 17 and he has been everything to me. I didn\u2019t even let my mom babysit til he was 4. And it was very rare since I moved out of state. I\u2019m not shaming your daughter as I\u2019m a completely different person, but I realized early on I was one and done. I wanted to raise him, live for him, and then do as I please. Your daughter\u2019s decision to procreate is her own and she needs to take accountability. There were and still are many options available to prevent pregnancy or terminate pregnancy. Adoption is also a choice. You have made it clear you are not looking to adopt. She needs to figure this out on her own. She is no longer 17. NTA",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I thought from the title, you were going to be an AH. But you are absolutely not! </p>\n\n<p>First, I was upset hearing Kelly announce her pregnancy at Opal\u2019s celebration dinner. No one asked her if she was with child, but she felt the need to outshine the daughter she birthed. I guess I should not be surprised Kelly is a completely selfish person. Then she tried to slide in their \u201cbusy lives\u201d in conversation so you would know you have yet another child to care for. Personally, I think if she wasn\u2019t too busy to lay with this man, she shouldn\u2019t be too busy to raise that child. </p>\n\n<p>So people think you are wrong for shutting her down right then and there. Well, they can think that. They\u2019re not the ones who have cleaned up her mess before. They\u2019re not the ones expected to do so again. It\u2019s easy for them to say you\u2019re favoring your first grandchild. Shut them down the way you shut Kelly down. You have one life to live and can\u2019t continue to keep living for others.

She lasted about a year and half before my grandparents sued for custody. I grew up with her in and out of my life (not to mention consciousness) and it has really impacted our relationship in the worst ways. I mean, it would take about 1 minute to scroll through the last 3 years of text messages between us. When I was 14, my mom had a miscarriage likely due to continued overuse of prescription drugs. She was so moved by this that she stopped using the drugs that caused her to pass out on the couch daily in order to try and get pregnant again. \n\nShe succeeded and had my half-sister when I was 15. Honestly, I was and still am upset that she got her shit together for this new family when she could never do it for me. Even more upsetting is when she has complained about my sister\u2019s behavior to the point of asking my grandma for help again (though not to the same extent as in the past). My grandma is now in her 70s and can\u2019t possibly raise another child, nor should she have to. Ironically, it leaves me as the only functional adult (now 26) who could take in my sister if needed. I can certainly see that I am harboring resentments that are doing me no good, but who wouldn\u2019t? My mother once said to me while complaining about trying to discipline my sister, \u201cI\u2019m doing my best, I\u2019ve never been a mother before\u201d. You can imagine, that stung a bit. \n\nThis comment may have gotten away from me a bit, but my point is that the whole situation that is unfolding is likely very difficult for Opal to handle. Having a parent essentially give you up only to have a \u201cdo-over baby\u201d years later is such a slap in the face, whether intended to be or not. \n\nNot only do I think that you are NTA, I think you should have gone even further to add more distance between Opal and your daughter (although, if you\u2019re anything like my grandparents, I\u2019m sure you see Opal as your own daughter as well). My advice: therapy and lots of it. I saw in your comments and edit that you are already doing this, but I would recommend some type of family therapy as well (NOT with Kelly). Seeing Opal\u2019s point of view with her help will allow more communication between you, with the added benefits of becoming closer in the process. My grandma still struggles to understand my resentment, and I think that would have really helped. I wish you and Opal the best and hope for the smoothest possible resolution.",

Kelly became pregnant with Opal at sixteen. My husband, Eddy, and I have always believed in having the right to choose. However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.\n\nWe helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn\u2019t complain about why she \u201chad to be there\" to look after Opal.\n\nKelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.\n\nKelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well. She has good friends, plays Tennis, participates in volunteer projects, and plans to be a marine biologist after graduation.\n\nThe school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend\u2019s child. \n\nWe already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal\u2019s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were \u201cso busy!\u201d with life right now.\n\nEddy and I interrupted Kelly and told her we would have nothing to do with raising this new baby and would not be providing anything for it (supplies, childcare, etc.) Kelly flipped out and an argument ensued.\n\nKelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.\n\nKelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into \u201csides.\u201d The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don\u2019t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.\n\nOpal likes to show us stories from here sometimes, so I thought it would be a good place to ask for a neutral perspective.

I know she was just short of 18yrs old and you were between a rock and a hard spot then. You could have taken a hard line back then and refused anything to do with Opal but I think Kelly wouldn't have responded a way a mother should.  After going through the experience, you absolutely have the right to announce in front of the Pope if you want, that you are not raising another child for her as you did with Opal.  For all purposes,  she abandoned Opal who would have ended up in foster homes had you not taken her. That gives you the absolute right to specify what you are and aren't willing to do with this 2nd baby.\n\nI'm curious,  how does Opal view Kelly, as her mother or more like a sister? Does she call her Mom? Had Kelly ever tried to take Opal into her home , tried to raise her or contributed in any meaningful way?  I hate to say this but Kelly seems like bad news and I wonder if she is capable of caring for a child properly even at 33? If my parents had raised my child, I would be eternally grateful and would assure them I was ready to take full responsibility for the second one.  I wouldn't get into a hiss fit critizing what kind of grandparents my parents would be when they literally had raised my first child.  The fact that she got so upset about it makes me think she was planning on you both playing a major role with No.2...caring for it most of the time while she and the BF continued with their lives.  I would seriously send her a list of what you are willing to do and won't do.  Let her know under no circumstances will you be the babysitter or a daycare for No.2 nor will you contribute any monies to her upbringing.  You've done it once and that was more than enough. \n\nNot pointing the finger by any means, just a gentle suggestion from a mother with a child in his 30's too: Please get Opal on some sort of birth control and speak to her openly about condom use and safe sex. She's at a dangerous age and lightening does occasionally strike twice in the same spot",

When she was a teenager, she announced one night at dinner that she was going to get pregnant and have us raise her child.  No, she was not kidding.  We quickly informed her that if she got pregnant before she was well and truly prepared to be a parent, she would have two choices: abortion or adoption, and that she would be spending the last few months of her pregnancy in a home for unwed mothers.  Her face fell, but she knew we rock-solid meant it.  She knew we loved her, and that she could return home after, but raising another child was a big NOPE.

My late grandmother was much more of a parental figure to me than my mom, so losing grandma almost 4 months ago now was super hard. OP, you and your husband are the world\u2019s best grandparents, you\u2019re the best grandma ever and I just want to give you a big hug through this screen for being there as a rock for Opal. Kelly meanwhile, is such a deadbeat ringer. It\u2019s not even working all the time like what my mom was doing, Kelly was clearing out partying and hooking up way more often than actually being a parent, so she\u2019s clearly an irresponsible deadbeat. The fact that she not only usurped Opal\u2019s (not saying her daughter, because Kelly doesn\u2019t qualify as a mom in anyway) out of school dinner party, but also got mad because she was denied support from you, which she 100% expected wrongfully because, as we know, she just wants to shove responsibility on you and your husband. Kelly is a complete deadbeat AH of a mother, and I highly suggest you sit down with her and give her an ultimatum: Either Kelly aborts or gives up the baby for adoption, or have the baby but be denied complete support because clearly Kelly is going to be a terrible mother.\n\nDepending on the responses Kelly, I highly suspect you\u2019re going to unfortunately pick up care for the second child, since Kelly clearly doesn\u2019t have the mental aptitude to be an adult or a parent, judging on her behavior and reaction at dinner.\nI\u2019m not going to even fault you for what you said at dinner either, because yeah, wrong place wrong time, but the same can also be said for Kelly. Also, my grandmother was just as honest and blunt as you were at the dinner, so reading this genuinely made me smile, like I was reading/listening to grandma again.\n\nBut yeah, you\u2019re NTA. Kelly is a major AH and honestly doesn\u2019t deserve visitation with Opal or this new kid if she does have it. You\u2019re the world\u2019s best grandparents, keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Tell Opal for me that she\u2019s so lucky and blessed to be growing up with you and her grandpa (your hubby).\n\nTLDR: NTA. Kelly sucks and is the AH. OP is world\u2019s best grandmother. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nForgot to mention that when I was writing this, you reminded me of grandma so a few tears here and there. Man OP you\u2019re AWESOME!",

The fucking audacity of your daughter. \n\nPersonal view: So my SIL (husbands sister) had a child young (19) and struggled financially for years until finally her mom and stepdad took over (her son was about 5) as guardians. She didn\u2019t expect it, they all just agreed it was more stable for him. She dealt with a lot of guilt and always worked to try to become stable enough to take him back, but eventually enough time had passed that they all thought it would hurt him more to uproot him like that, so he stayed permanently with his grandparents. Anyway, a couple years ago she unexpectedly got pregnant (birth control failed). Her son was around 14 by this point. She did not keep it. Her number-one reason: she could not imagine the way it would make her son feel not being raised by her and then having to see her choose to have another child. She refused to put him through that. I dunno (nor really care) how others might see this, but I was really proud of her for thinking mostly about how this would affect *him*.\n\nJust the fact your daughter doesn\u2019t care how this (or anything) affects Opal is just disgusting (not to mention announcing it at her grad party?!?! WTF). Please, for the sake of your granddaughter, keep Kelly TF away from Opal. She doesn\u2019t deserve this. And thank you for standing up for your granddaughter.

I very obviously wasn\u2019t happy with the announcement though I did try to hide that, but I felt I was being replaced and so very jealous and angry - I *should* have gone into therapy tbh, and I\u2019m happy Opal is. \n\nMy grandmothers first words were: \u2018we\u2019re not raising this one\u2019 and my mom was obviously pissed. She ranted about that conversation until her passing. But my grandmother already had me (I\u2019ve never felt like a burden or unloved, my grandparents are really my parents & even at nearly 40 they still spoil me a bit!) and she knew she would be unable to raise another grandchild at her age and my grandfather agreed.\n\nThe biggest kicker is that my grandmother who raised me is my step-grandmother and the bad a very rocky relationship to say the least. My mother was very jealous of the bond I share with my mamaw, even though she has no blood relation to me or any sort of obligation. \n\nThere are just SO many emotions this poor girl is feeling, not to mention that the feeling of abandonment never truly goes away! \n\nOP is an amazing grandparent who clearly loves Opal and seems to have done an amazing job with her. She is clearly NTA and I have nothing but respect for her. \n\nIt always makes me so sad, or maybe empathetic is the better word? Grandparents should not have to raise their grandparents but I know far too many who have. And in the end my grandmother was right - my brother was eventually taken away by CPS and lived with his fathers family. So I feel badly for this new, innocent child and only hope that they have a better life than my brother. \n\nSorry for the novel, this just really touches my heart! OP you have nothing to be sorry for, you\u2019re giving your granddaughter everything she deserves. Not \u2018helping raise\u2019 as you\u2019ve done with Opal does not mean you\u2019ll love your new grandchild any less.",

They have both had drug problems in the past, but as far as I know they are both sober now and the baby is living with her father and his new baby and girlfriend. Anyway, when he was on a bender during my nieces first year, my sister would consistently disappear to go on a bender, sell drugs, buy drugs, etc. she would leave the baby with me and our mom. She would expect us to drop everything for her. And while I love her to death, I am not that child\u2019s father. I\u2019ve got my own shit, and so does my mom. She finally has her shit together though, and she was fighting for custody but ran out of funds. She gets visitation, though.",

She finished the school year, then got married and had the baby over summer break.  When school started back, she was there for junior year.  A couple of weeks into the school year she invited my daughter over to spend the night.  It was on a school night, and I was a little skeptical, but I told my daughter I'd drive her over and if I didn't like the situation she wasn't going to get to stay.  I wound up letting her stay, with an assurance that they'd be going to school in the morning.\n\nWhen my husband came home from work that evening and found out what was going on he didn't like it at all!  He thought I was out of my mind letting her stay the night.  It would be wildness and parties!!  I chuckled and told him it was going to be a good lesson.  \n\nI told him that when we got there and knocked on the door we were greeted by a tired looking young 19 year old wearing dirty work clothes and jiggling a fussy baby on his hip.  He let us in and we stepped into the kitchen so I could say hello to my daughter's friend.  She was in shorts and her bra because she was mopping the kitchen and their apartment didn't have air conditioning and it was boiling hot.  We chatted a minute or two and as I was leaving I jokingly told them not to party all night and she tells me that they had to be up by 5:30 to get everyone to where they needed to be on time the next morning.  I walked back through the living room and said goodbye to the young dad who was bouncing the baby on his knee while he watched a very snowy episode of judge Judy because they couldn't afford cable.\n\n\nThe next afternoon my daughter came home from school and I asked her how her visit was and her reply was, \"Oh, Mama....they're sooooo poor!  Justin doesn't get his paycheck until Friday, so we went to Wal-Mart and they returned some baby gifts to buy some groceries!\".   We talked a little bit about the difficulties they were going to face and how hard they were going to have to work and that was that.   \n\nI guess she learned from that night, she recently turned 33 and is still childfree!  But she's getting married this fall, so that might change.\n\nMaybe a lot of parents wouldn't have considered the sleepover, but my only regret is that I didn't drop off a couple of pizzas.",
