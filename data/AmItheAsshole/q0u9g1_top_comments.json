They had a system where, if you beat your sales the previous quarter, your paycheck went up 10%. If you didn't, it went down 10%. So, people would sell a lot leading up to Christmas, and go from 10 to 11 that spring. Spring sales aren't as good, so they'd go down to...$9.90 for the summer. Back-to-school sales would drive it up, so they'd get a raise, and then fall it would drop and down goes the paycheck. Each year people would earn less and less. I'd been late only a few times (almost always early though) by a minute or two. At 8 times, they fire you, and  since I didn't have enough tardies, I KNEW they'd find a reason to fire before 6 months so they didn't have to pay benefits.  \n\n\nKnowing this, I gave every single sale to the other four people on the floor that fall.

All four of them beat their sales and lost no money on their paychecks. I'd been one of the very top sellers; furniture and men's suits outsold me, but those are big-ticket items. That month, I sold $8 of stuff; every single sale was credited to coworkers. Management was pissed when they fired me and found out! They pulled me in to tell me I was fired, and I said I knew, that's why I had $8 of sales instead of several thousand.  The reason they fired me? We were super short-staffed, and I was really sick, but I came in anyways to help cover.  I worked all afternoon, and was supposed to leave at 6.  At 5, the store was nearly empty and we had plenty of employees so I asked to leave an hour early. Being sick as a dog, the floor manager (she was nice) told me to go home and get better.   \n\n\nThey fired me for leaving work early :D There wasn't anything else they could dig up to justify if.

In the end I quit because my voice took over 6 weeks to come back at any reasonable volume and only got back to \u2018normal\u2019 about 6 months after discharge. \n\nI said all of that to say this- it was a pretty crappy job but I was given ample time to recover and told after I quit that I\u2019d be welcomed back/given a good reference should I need it. Take the time to recover fully and I hope you find something better when the time comes :)\n\nNTA, good on you for standing up for yourself against a crap policy. Policies like this are the reason so many people end up going to work sick.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I was working at a call center when I had a health scare in 2017, (coma for 27 hours and ICU for 3 days) we kept my boss appraised of the situation as we could. I\u2019d had a breathing tube and had no voice for almost 2 weeks. In the end I quit because my voice took over 6 weeks to come back at any reasonable volume and only got back to \u2018normal\u2019 about 6 months after discharge. </p>\n\n<p>I said all of that to say this- it was a pretty crappy job but I was given ample time to recover and told after I quit that I\u2019d be welcomed back/given a good reference should I need it.

It was ridiculous that they earned sick days, but immediately got a point for using 1.  But if you took two sick days in a row, you still only got the 1 point.  So they had a lot of people that took 2 days when maybe only 1 was needed, because it wouldn't cost an extra point and they could actually use a day they earned.   Also in the orientation they were specifically told that salaried employees didn't get points,  but found out a few months later they lied and actually had LESS points that they could get and still have a job (6 in a year instead of 12).   I HATED it and would never work for that type of company.  Thankfully he's not working for them anymore.",

It was ridiculous that they earned sick days, but immediately got a point for using 1.  But if you took two sick days in a row, you still only got the 1 point.  So they had a lot of people that took 2 days when maybe only 1 was needed, because it wouldn&#39;t cost an extra point and they could actually use a day they earned.

I had a friend who was fired when she fended off the sexual harassment from the senior partner. The thing that saved her is that she was pregnant at the time and threatened them with a law suit. It wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to the firm - except that there had been many other instances where he pulled the same crap with female associates, so she got a settlement at least.  I had a partner call me and tell me that I had to come down to work the same day I was released from the hospital (not a baby - diabetes complications.) I was able to persuade him to get a secretary to the phone and dictate a motion to her so that it could be filed. It was my boss\u2019s son and when his father found out, he at least chewed out his son.",
