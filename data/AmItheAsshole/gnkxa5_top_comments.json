Your wife has a gold digger in training and setting her up with unrealistic expectations. They are both 16 year olds and I\u2019m sure neither of them have much money. They should both be contributing not making the poor guy give her the little money he has so he can\u2019t get ahead. She should be focussing on teaching her about standards and respect out with money. Like how he treats her and if he\u2019s a caring bf and listens to her. Just because someone can spoil you doesn\u2019t mean they love you. She\u2019ll end up dating jerks that treat her like shit and just throw money at her to make it better in the future. Her bf buying her her fave candy, or taking her out for a meal once in a while, making her breakfast would be cute and generous within his means. Ugh the asking for gift card makes me the most mad. It\u2019s so impersonal and she\u2019s really just using and manipulating him. That\u2019s not healthy. Might be worth showing your wife some of the comments here.",

He seems very respectful, just shy.  \n\nMy wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. \n\nSince my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. \n\nSome of the advice I\u2019ve heard my wife give is \u2018oh it\u2019s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!\u2019 Or \u2018oh honey don\u2019t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would\u2019 and similar. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away \u2018two people in a partnership should be contributing equally\u2019 and my personal favorite \u2018if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it\u2019s reasonable to split the payment\u2019. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven\u2019t been anywhere obviously since we\u2019re home but the way she talks about him \u2018oh I\u2019ll just ask him to pay for x\u2019 etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I told her that it\u2019s not cute for her to be thinking it\u2019s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I remember how hurt my college roommate was when I refused to go to Florida with her on her family trip.  I regret it now; she took it personally.  So, when I raised my kids, I told them it\u2019s okay to receive gifts because it\u2019s like receiving a piece of someone\u2019s heart.  They have all been more places than I have ever been, as a result.  The kids are fun to be around, and we did go through times when we didn\u2019t have much.  But their friends would invite them to Florida, or to stay with others in Cincinnati, or NYC, or CA.  One daughter has been so many places - she doesn\u2019t just take though.  She helps with the food or the moral support, whatever the friend needs.  It\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about receiving gifts from the heart.  And you bring yourself and give some love back.  I think older people made it way too complicated and it\u2019s like putting up roadblocks.  One should never ask for things from friends, though, unless it\u2019s help with maybe moving or some project that the friend could totally help with.  People genuinely want to help each other out.  And for those to are choosing beggars - well, those people get found out pretty quick as being mooches.  Friends are always there for each other, thick and thin.  My kids think they haven\u2019t lived extraordinary lives, but I know they have. Already they\u2019ve been on more adventures than I have, and they know more experts in their fields than I ever met.  So, I know accepting gifts from hearts is a good way to go, and also to give gifts back is just as important, whether time, or a place to stay for a friend down on their luck - anything can help and will be remembered later.",

Then I was talking to my dad in my late twenties about this and he laughed and said in college he would tip the waiter/bartender and ask him to take a tray waters to a table of young women he and his friends wanted to talk to.  When the waiter would point at my dad he would arrogantly gesture like &quot;no big deal&quot;. He said the ones with good senses of humor would invite them to come talk.  I think this is adorable and I&#39;m going to tell my boys about it. You want a girl who likes you for you, not because she gets free stuff. And you shouldn&#39;t ever have to pay for someones attention.</p>\n</div>",

Not related, but...in a similar vein.\n\nMy daughter was probably 10, and got invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party. Cute little invite card came home to me, had the RSVP info, whatever. It said that they\u2019d be going roller skating, and that they needed to have $5 or $10 for the \u201cnightclub\u201d at the roller rink (it\u2019s a little under-21 dance club, been there for decades; I went to it as a teen myself). Okay, that\u2019s fine, although I know the club does parties as well, but then again if they\u2019d paid for a roller skating party then reserving a section in the club might be a bit much? Whatever, I make sure I have cash for her in the amount stated.\n\nI ended up RSVP\u2019ing late, less than a week before the party, and spoke with the mother; I pointed out that while I wanted my daughter to go, transportation was tricky because my fianc\u00e9 would be at work with our only vehicle. She said it was no problem, she could pick my daughter up, since she only lived about a block from me. She mentioned the money for the club at that point, or I did, and confirmed that it was the amount on the card. No problem.\n\nDay of the party, I call just to clarify when my kiddo will be picked up and where, and what time I should expect her back. She tells me that now my kid needs another $8 for the *skate rentals* if she plans to skate! I was dumbfounded, because how in the hell are you gonna invite a kid to a **roller skating party** and then tell them to rent their own skates?! PLUS pay for the special \u201cnightclub\u201d the kids are gonna go to?! At that point I almost said to forget it, she wasn\u2019t going, but my daughter had been so excited all week for the party, and I wasn\u2019t gonna ruin that for her.\n\nWorst part was though, I didn\u2019t have any cash on me, aside from the $10 I\u2019d already given my daughter. I don\u2019t carry cash generally, but I\u2019m also on a fixed income, so I was also seriously tapped *anyway*...and I couldn\u2019t easily get to a no-fees ATM to withdraw what I\u2019d need. Thankfully a friend happened to drop by and when I told her what was up, she immediately handed me $10 (I was short $3 at that point, so this was several bucks more than necessary). When I said that it was too much, she told me to tell my daughter to get herself a treat while she was there, and that was that. I was so thankful!\n\nBut that was the last time my daughter went anywhere with the birthday girl. I was furious that she\u2019d been put in that position, and that *I* had been! Because seriously, who invites elementary school kids to a birthday party and then makes them pay their own damned way?!",

I\u2019ve been trolling the nparents sub for a while now bc my mom has always had some \u201cthings\u201d especially with attachment and setting boundaries. I\u2019ve been wondering for a while now if she\u2019s an nmom. For example I got a phone call the other day from my bf and i had texted him how I was sad beforehand but when he called I was with my mom, and I didn\u2019t want to talk about my depression in front of her (I hate phone calls in front of anyone really). So I answered and I said \u201cI can\u2019t talk right now can I call you back in a bit\u201d bc my mom and I were in the middle of something. So I hang up and my mom is looking at me all hurt and said something along the lines of \u201cwow you\u2019ve got something you don\u2019t want to say in front of me? If you can\u2019t say it in front of your mom you shouldn\u2019t be saying it\u201d. \n\nShe also takes offense that I don\u2019t want to live in my hometown. I live in south Ga and I\u2019d like to move to north Ga (or further) and she literally started crying one time calling me selfish bc she\u2019s done everything for me and I just want to \u201cabandon\u201d her. I have many more similar stories\n\nEdit: this makes me sound like I\u2019ve lived at home my entire life but I was living near Savannah Ga for 6 years and loved it, have been home for a year now to save money and find a job in ATL but then covid. My mom keeps telling me how I\u2019ll hate ATL btw",
