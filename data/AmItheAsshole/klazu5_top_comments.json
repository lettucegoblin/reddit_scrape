This is a teachable moment for her and you stating what you think an ideal mate should do. \n\nShe doesn't like to make waves. OK, but you stand up for what is right. She should see that the family put the three of you (You, her, and your cousin) in a horrific situation. \n\nThey broke the tradition you laid out of $500 to married couples to $300 for non married couples (aka single). These were the parameters for the tradition. \n\nBy giving you two the $500, the message was targeted to you cousin that they consider him single and don't think his marriage is legit, by showing him that they even considered your impending nuptials more of a marriage than his legal one. \n\nYou COULD apologize for using the word, \"Mistake\" but I don't think you need to. You were showing that the mistake was that they broke this tradition that existed before your fianc\u00e9 was near you family and also confronted them on their bigotry. And by them I mean everyone in that room that agreed with your grandparents (including your cousin's family - mom, dad, any siblings he has) or them condoning it through inaction. \n\nThe horrible position that they put you all in to make that uncomfortable and making waves in the first place, you were 100% right to push back. I can't imagine the anger, the pain your cousin was going through. \n\nIf I was like your cousin, I would have at that moment loved you like my own brother, because obviously his own parents failed him as did everyone in that room but you. \n\nI can understand your fianc\u00e9 not wanting to make waves and it's unfortunate that this happened while they were welcoming her. But, they also put her in an awkward position to go along with the family's bigotry. Almost like a test if they would agree with them or not. \n\nHer anger should have been transferred to them for doing that to you two and her future cousin-in-law. \n\nShe 100% showed it wasn't about it wasn't about you making the choice for her, when she said she would have rather have done this in private. She cared too much on what people thought of her, than what pain they were putting someone else through. That I would discuss with her and not break it off, but make it known that you were disappointed in her and while you may not think less of her, shows you what type of person she is. Then maybe find out why she doesn't make waves. Family issues of her own, ect... and actually encourage her that sometimes making waves is exactly what needs to happen for change to go through, or to show someone else that you love them despite what everyone else thinks. \n\nShe may see that her own desires were maybe a little selfish, in comparison to the issue. I honestly would have felt bad for her too if they didn't show some sort of acceptance in the family. But they did! She got what she wanted. And her not agreeing with you had them still accepting her, but she should have been proud you turned down the seemingly nice gesture to show she was accepted in the family. \n\nThis was a horrific situation to put you three in, and you made a great choice! Thank you! It's a rough one and not many people would have made waves. \n\nMy own boyfriend took time to make waves with his family who didn't accept me as family either. Making it known with statements like, \"He can stay for Christmas dinner, but he'll have to leave after because that's only for family.\" Meanwhile, straight brother's fiance was allowed to stay for \"family\" despite them all knowing her only for 1 year and me for 6 years. I have been told, \"I love you as a person, I just don't want you for my son. I want him with a woman.\" \n\nIt was when I was introduced at the wedding as a \"family friend\" there by showing how the family thought of me even more to others, that it hurt me. They recognized it could be painful, but they wanted to make sure their religious friends didn't think less of them. They also were \"saving\" my boyfriend from the shame he might feel. I am something to be ashamed of apparently or his homosexuality is. Meanwhile he is happy, in love and building a future with someone and that is something he should be ashamed of? \n\nHe finally made waves and they have done better. But, to be honest OP, it's still there. We aren't married, but are privately talking about it, and have been together for 8 years. When they introduced us to the first grand-child in the family it was, 'This is your Uncle Fabrice. This is Sean.\" It stings. I don't trust them to do the right thing if my boyfriend were to die. I think they would try to take everything he leaves behind, not listen to what he wants medically, ect.. I don't trust them at all anymore. I love them, but don't trust them as people. Does that make sense. Even after 8 years. \n\nI do wish that my boyfriend made waves sooner or one of his brother's stood up to how we were treated. So I wish I had you as a cousin. I would have asked if you two wanted to come over to my house and spend the rest of Christmas with my husband and I. \n\nThank you so much for doing something right, despite the fact of what it could cost you with your grandparents, Aunts and Uncles, or even your own family. You show what true family is, that you will stand up for the. You will make a wonderful Dad and Husband to someone. Who will make waves to show them you love them and don't condone any mistreatment.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel the same as her, but I get it. She\u2019s not a monster or a homophobe for preferring to have done this privately as a united front (as OP clarifies in comments) versus causing a scene.</p>\n\n<p>And also: how do the cousins feel about this? Because personally, as a queer person, I\u2019d like to be consulted before a straight person in the room decides to blow shit up into a massive scene on my behalf.

What OP did is very admirable, but he should have consulted with her first, and he should apologize for giving a decent sum of THEIR money away without consulting her first, and explain it's just something he felt had to be done. Neither him nor his girlfriend are in the wrong.\n\nEdit: I'm also talking about this is the simplest terms, it's also subjecting the fianc\u00e9 to all sorts of family and personal relationship dynamics.\n\nEdit: And to the \"ThEy aRe NoT mArRiEd\" people.

It is not the fianc\u00e9s responsibility or duty to sacrifice to make things right. What OP did is very admirable, but he should have consulted with her first, and he should apologize for giving a decent sum of THEIR money away without consulting her first, and explain it&#39;s just something he felt had to be done. Neither him nor his girlfriend are in the wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m also talking about this is the simplest terms, it&#39;s also subjecting the fianc\u00e9 to all sorts of family and personal relationship dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: And to the &quot;ThEy aRe NoT mArRiEd&quot; people.

I remember when my husband and I got engaged and I went to his family's Thanksgiving. I'm normally a pretty outspoken person but I was extra careful as I was trying so hard to make a good impression.\n\nThe new fianc\u00e9/spouse/\"outsider\" is often in a weaker position in terms of getting away with things with their SO's family. Most people can feel pretty secure that even if they have an argument with their parents or grandparents, disagree with them in front of everyone, ect that their parents and grandparents will still love them. However, they don't love the person joining the family. They don't know them and don't have much of an opinion yet. If the new person has an argument with them or calls them out or behaves in ways their own (gran)kid would be forgiven for, they may just end up not liking them and having long term tension.\n\nI'm not saying OP was wrong or their fianc\u00e9e was right. But I am saying we don't need to assume that fianc\u00e9e is lying about her reason and it's the $200 that really mattered to her.

Which is subtly different but may have felt to his fianc\u00e9e like his grandparents were saying \"welcome to the family\"/she is part of the family, and OP is saying she isn't part of the family. I get OP did this to make a statement about his cousin's relationship being recognized and just wasn't thinking about how he was also declaring his relationship with fianc\u00e9e wasn't \"real\"/committed enough yet for her to be family. Given this move and the following argument led them to then promptly leave, I can empathize that this is probably not how fianc\u00e9e wanted meeting her new family to go. Ie OP declares in front of everyone that giving her a present at Christmas was a mistake since she's not family yet then they leave.\n\nI don't think we all need to skip to \"dump your fianc\u00e9e\" over this. I do think it was good of OP to stand up for his cousin so NTA.

And I think that ideally fianc\u00e9e would be more pleased that OP stood up for his cousin then upset about how he did it. Though I do think how OP stood up for his cousin was non-optimal. In that he took the $200 Christmas gift his grandparents gave someone else (his fianc\u00e9e) and gave it to cousin, instead of giving part or all of his own gift. That money was for her. And he said that giving it to her was a mistake, which sounds a lot like he is saying treating her as a member of the family is a mistake. He could have said excluding cousin's husband was a mistake without saying including his fianc\u00e9e in the family was a mistake. He could have tried to even things out by giving his own money/gift instead of someone else's. \n\nAnyway, I defiantly think it was cool of him to step up and defend his cousin. However, I just think that before we all jump on \"fianc\u00e9e is a terrible, dump her!\" I want to examine how OP says she stated she felt, which is she stated she felt he rejected her in front of his family. This can be seen as a separate issue to standing up for his cousin, since he actually didn't need to reject her in front of his family to do that.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Marriages also break off? The vast majority of the world&#39;s countries allow divorce.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I agree that standing up for cousin was good, which is why I said OP was NTA. And I think that ideally fianc\u00e9e would be more pleased that OP stood up for his cousin then upset about how he did it. Though I do think how OP stood up for his cousin was non-optimal. In that he took the $200 Christmas gift his grandparents gave someone else (his fianc\u00e9e) and gave it to cousin, instead of giving part or all of his own gift. That money was for her. And he said that giving it to her was a mistake, which sounds a lot like he is saying treating her as a member of the family is a mistake. He could have said excluding cousin&#39;s husband was a mistake without saying including his fianc\u00e9e in the family was a mistake. He could have tried to even things out by giving his own money/gift instead of someone else&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I defiantly think it was cool of him to step up and defend his cousin.
