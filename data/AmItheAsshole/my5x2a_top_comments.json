Tell him you&#39;re sorry that he did not like how things went and that he felt embarrassed but instead of being angry with you surely he can see that hospitality is a lot of work for a couple and that <em>you both</em> really should both work together and support each other to get it done and have fun at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>If he can&#39;t be moved by a reasonable discussion, then he lacks humility and I got nothing for you, sorry.</p>\n</div>",

Even a simple \"hey I really would like your help with a party I plan on ________ would that be ok? Would be great.\n\nAnd after everytime he needs to help clean again none negotiable.\n\nAlso consider enforcing having some of your friends over at the same time or even say you expect something after as a thank you for the help. Doesnt need to be big. Make him cook for you for a day and help you out or do a chore you normally do but hate doing as a thanks and show he appreciated your help. Have him take you on a date. \n\nShowing appreciation is important in relationships alongside give and take.

But things need to change for you cause thats not fair nor ok. First off you need to be asked first. Thats none negotiable. Its awful he just demands stuff from you. Thats not ok nor healthy. Even a simple &quot;hey I really would like your help with a party I plan on ________ would that be ok? Would be great.</p>\n\n<p>And after everytime he needs to help clean again none negotiable.</p>\n\n<p>Also consider enforcing having some of your friends over at the same time or even say you expect something after as a thank you for the help. Doesnt need to be big. Make him cook for you for a day and help you out or do a chore you normally do but hate doing as a thanks and show he appreciated your help. Have him take you on a date. </p>\n\n<p>Showing appreciation is important in relationships alongside give and take. Sounds like he has been doing a lotta taking though and notta lotta giving and may need a kick in the rear as a reminder like what you did. </p>\n\n<p>Also.... Great job sticking up for yourself!</p>\n</div>",

I am not close with them) for barbecue parties. He prides himself on his BBQ skills. The thing is... I always end up doing everything! He buys and preps the meat and then grills and serves it. I have to buy drinks, get out enough dishes, clean up the patio/deck (non native speaker, idk which one to use). I prepare the sides and veggies, I refill the drinks and take away dishes (we don\u2019t use paper plates or plastic cups since I find it wasteful) so as to keep the main table tidy. It\u2019s just nonstop work for me. \n\nHe just told me last week that he invited his friends for Saturday (so yesterday). Just announced it, didn\u2019t ask me. I said well okay, do I know anyone? Nope, those are his work mates and they won\u2019t be bringing their spouses. My husband called it a \u201cguys\u2019 night\u201d. I said okay then, guys\u2019 night, well enjoy yourselves, I will be in my craft room working on some of my projects and drinking wine. He said he will handle it.\n\nSpoiler alert, he did not handle it. He got the meat alright, but just ignored any other preparation and I was just so sick and tired of being taken for granted (he never -asks- me for help, I just do stuff...) so I didn\u2019t do anything. The patio was a mess, the upholstery of the garden furniture was all messy from our dogs, the table wasn\u2019t wiped down, there was stuff lying all around. His friends arrived, I welcomed them and then excused myself to my crafts room, put some music on and worked. Cue the messages.\n\nHe started asking for stuff, like where are the plates (we only keep a small set in the kitchen, the rest is in the basement), where are the cups, why isn\u2019t the beer chilled, where is the non alcoholic beer - did I not buy it? Where are the sides? I just replied that he said he would handle it all himself. \n\nI checked on the guys a few hours later and it was a disaster. Table all cluttered, they ordered some takeout as sides, there weren\u2019t enough dishes and silverware, someone had to go drive for drinks. \n\nOn Sunday (today) he was all grumpy and actually told me that he is disappointed that I didn\u2019t pull my weight and that I made our family look sloppy and bad. I told him that I am not his little housewife and that he is a big guy and if he embarrassed himself in front of his work mates, that\u2019s all on him. And that I\u2019m glad that he can see at least a tiny bit of work that I do around the house. He got upset and went for a run to let off some steam. \n\nOh and the patio is full of dishes, he didn\u2019t even clean the grill.

And because I don't want to tell you what to do, I end up doing them. \n\nI really encourage everyone to read the whole post in the link. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/135139343727703/posts/503779636863670/",

He was very confused about the question and I had to explain that sides, drinks, desert, napkins, cups, ice, etc doesn't just pop out of my ass so if he wants to host a BBQ he is either going about it half-assed or he needs to go back to the store. He had to go back to the store 3 times because he kept forgetting things (including propane) but he now understands what hosting actually involves. Some people just don't think through stuff. They're unable to break down tasks into organizational steps (that's one of the many ADHD symptoms my SO has) so they need someone to spell it out for them, especially the first time they do a task. He knows what needs to happen to host a party now and thankfully, that means we don't host very often.",

In the south where actual barbecued/smoked meat is serious business, BBQ will either mean pulled pork shoulder (Memphis, Carolinas, Kansas City, etc) or Beef Brisket (Texas).

It\u2019s an old greyhound and we pulled all the seats out, laid down some nice flooring, built a bar, expanded and fancied up the bathroom, put some couches and recliner in, wired in some outlets that are powered by a generator, and hung 4 TV\u2019s and a bunch of speakers. It was a ton of work and took a whole summer. \n\nThe line: we tailgate in general admission tailgating because im cheap. We like to get 8 parking spots and in GA, they\u2019re $5 a spot. To get a reserved spot, you have to be part of team makers, donate *thousands* to earn enough points to make the reserved list, then it\u2019s $20/spot. So we park in GA and that means lining up. This college does tailgating the dumbest way possible and won\u2019t let us in the actual parking lot until 5 hours prior to kickoff. Lots of people tailgate so we have to pre stage in line in a cul de sac on friday. We get there at 7am to guarantee we\u2019ll get in the lot. I sit with the bus all day, watch tv, take naps, order food, and visit with our friends in line. Then at 5pm on friday, we pull up onto the street for the staging line. This is when my husband shows up and takes over sitting with the bus. We usually go for supper, have a couple beers, then i go home to prep food and the boys (husband and his friends) get shitfaced and sleep on the bus. Fridays are so much fun - it\u2019s just a giant party on the street. The next morning, 5 hours prior to kickoff, we pull into the parking lot and set up. \n\nThe people: we have a solid core group of friends that tailgate with us. The last couple years have been great because they\u2019ve insisted on helping me. Every week i make a list of what we need and we divvy up the list. There\u2019s probably 15 of us that are there every week and contribute, and another 20-50, depending on the week, that pop in to say hi, grab some food, do a shot with us, etc. Some are people that stop by every week, some are complete strangers. My favorite are people from the visiting team that stop in. \n\nCrockpots and equipment: i am a huge proponent of making food in crockpots for tailgating because i can prep it the day before, get it hot at home, and just be done. I bring the crockpots with me when i go to the lot in the morning and plug them in and bam, people are fed. We also bought a blackstone flattop grill, so last year we experimented with some other food like pizzas and breakfast foods. It was delicious, but someone has to be a dedicated cook and i *hate* doing it. If someone else volunteers to do it, im all about it. We have two 10ft by 20ft tents, 3 tables, a bunch of coolers, lights, 4 generators, heaters for fall and winter games, the tailgating bar....there\u2019s so much to set up and tear down, but we\u2019ve been doing it for so long we can be set up in about 20 minutes. \n\nMy husband and i always go to the game, but not everyone does. Due to covid, our 2020 fall season was moved to spring and tailgating was cancelled. We didn\u2019t go to any games this spring because work was busy for both of us and with covid, we decided to sit this season out. We hopefully will be back in the fall! \n\nAny other questions, feel free to ask :)\n\nEdit: [some pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/yu4wCUr)",

I left because if I didn't, I was going to die, and I thought he was a good father and would take care of the kids, only it turns out his treatment of the kids tanked because he resented me actually leaving.  Lots of other stuff happened that I won't relate here, but in the end, I don't blame him for the relationship because we were both only playing the roles we were taught growing up, but I do resent like hell the way he treated our daughters.  He's on wifie number three, btw.  She's a nice  gal but she isn't bright, and sometimes worked three menial jobs at a time to bring in half the household income that he insisted on.  He's retired and she is still working because he won't spend any of his precious money on the house.  He spends his money on the latest tech toys, though.

        "body": "They arent dusty ass men at first. It's usually small compromises after small compromises that add up. First you see they need their laundry done and because your a good partner and have been socialized to believe you are showing love by doing an act of service for your partner you just go ahead and take care of that small thing. Then it's the dishes. Then its picking up things and washing the bathroom. Then 2 years have passed and your perfectly good man is sitting in the livingroom night after night on his head set playing video games while you cook and clean and he has no idea suddenly where the heck you keep the collinder. He is guilt free in this process. Because this is socially acceptable. Where as woman are conditioned to feel actual guilt if their partner is working and they are not. We divided things into mens work and womans work hundreds of years ago and have been working off that model ever since. Mens work declined or was outsourced. Nobody is going out and killing something daily for the family to eat for instance. Not many men are physically building shelters or chopping wood for a cooking fire, but woman are still stiring the pot. And woman are still feeling like they have to keep stiring it because they like to feel needed and arent ready to hand over the spoon. Part of their worth as a person is that they hold the damn spoon. They probably had lots of woman before them that showed them that too, woman they loved and wanted to be like. Eventually you have to hand over the spoon and get to a place that makes ypu realize your intrinsic self worth is not in being the one who stirs the pot or does the laundry. But when you are ready to hand over the spoon sometimes the man you are handing it to is not too happy about it. Suddenly they have to get off the headset and join in and they can find a million reasons that this is unfair. Add the fact that many woman are afraid of men and confrontation with men due to violence they have witnessed or been a subject of. woman sometimes back down on handing over the spoon when any resistance is met. Suddenly it becomes a small thing as they contemplate their overall security. Even chancing the fight that has no violence but could jeopardize the relationship that results in the dual income lifestyle now almost impossible to live without.  It's hard to know what will happen when you hand someone the spoon. It's just as hard to stop worrying when they take it. Because now you have to worry that you have diminished your worth, made it easier for your partner to justify leaving your ass for someone who wont hand over the spoon, and if the person with the spoon now has any idea they have to scrape the bottom of the pot with it so they dont burn the pot and make it impossible to clean later. And do you tell them about the scraping part? Do you then sound like a nag telling them how to do their new job? What does being a nag imply? Its panic inducing all these thoughts!  Some woman just keep the damn spoon to not deal with any of this. But let me tell you the spoon is more than just this spoon. It's the mental energy to make the lists, the physical energy to gather all the ingredients, it's the emotional labor of caring about allergies, dislikes and various needs of everyone eating from the pot. Its the stress of trying to manage your time to get from work, to the pot... and the self esteem damage of stirring it while someone sits comfortably in the other room, not doing a damn thing and hasnt an inciling that anything is wrong. Woman will continue to stir until it's completely socially unacceptable for them to do so and men are valued instead for this action. It will take generations probably. But we cant change it unless we are collectively brave and chance everything and hand over the damn spoon then support those woman that this choice doesnt work out so well for. (Support womans shelters, legislation to protect single parents, protect jobs for pregnant women, maternity leave expansion and family care help to mothers, food stamps for single parents are good places to start.) \n\nSecretly I hope anyone who took the time to read this hands over the spoon tonight and if your a dude I secretly hope you take the damn thing and smile and understand your partner might be a little panicked and edgy. I hope you pat her on the head and kiss her forehead and tell her, you got this and to go have a glass of wine. (She may try making up her self worth to you and herself by running to do some other task.) Insist she is worth more though and persist.",

The thought that I may have to ask him for more in the future or need help with our daughter really hit me hard, and I say down to discuss it with him.

My 14yo can cook pretty much all boxed stuff, or anything with simple instructions. If he&#39;s pushed to plans and cook a meal it&#39;s always sloppy Joe&#39;s and Mac and cheese, but he&#39;s 14. I kinda expect that. He&#39;ll make oatmeal or instant noodles for breakfast and lunch for himself. Or smoothies. This shit is NOT that hard.
