But the end result was not great: you didn't get to give the presentation that you worked so hard on, you got detention, that other girl won. \n\nLet's say you did your thing, presented, and the girl won anyway.  Maybe you could've mentioned something to your teacher and/or principal about how the judge wasn't paying attention to anyone but the girl who won, and they could've looking into it. Maybe your teacher had already noticed that the judge was doing a bad job and was going to handle it after class, but because you got up and said that, s/he had to deal with it right in the middle of things.  If you thought the presentation was plagiarized, you could've said something privately to your teacher, and s/he could've looked into it and then maybe the award would've been given to someone else instead.\n\nIt can be really hard, in the moment, to think clearly about a situation that is obviously so unfair.  If you can take a few second and a few deep breaths, you might find that you can come up with a better resolution to the situation other than running your mouth and getting in trouble.  And in the working world, you can get fired for saying the wrong thing to the wrong person.  If you use your time and experiences in high school to learn how to navigate this situations, I can guarantee that you'll be more successful in the future (especially since a lot of adults still haven't figured this out). \n\nI wasn't going to take the time to type this all out since my verdict will probably get me some downvotes anyway, but I've noticed that you've been responding to comments and paying attention, and I thought maybe you could use this advice in the future.

The prize was some scholarship money for college. \n\nOur classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.\n\nIt was annoying how the \"outside judge\"kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved in and other people had presented. \n\nIt was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.\n\nSo I went up and said \"Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.\"\n\nShe sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. \n\nThe girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.\n\nMy principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring.

        "body": "That shit started way before high school for me. \n\nI vividly remember the teacher praising her favorites after we had had a test on the human body in school. I think I was 10 or 11. Anyway this teacher, she hated me from before we ever even met. For some reason she hated my family. She hated my older brother and treated him as crap and then she hated me and treated me like crap and then she hated my younger brother and treated him like crap. She now only allowed but actually encountered the bullying of my brothers and she openly bullied all of us. So this test on the human body, well one of her favorites got 95% and she stood in front of the entire class and gushed over her and her greatness for at least 15 minutes or so talking about how amazing and skilled and talented she was and on and on it went and the point of it was to make sure we all knew how much better than us her beloved favorite was. And when she was done with all that praise I guess she felt she had to mention that there was actually a higher score so she venomously spits out \u201cand yeah Gaiasdotter got 98\u201d and the way she said it was so hateful and she glared at me with pure hatred and disgust in a way that clearly told not just me but everyone that what I had done was unforgivable and I would pay for it! I\u2019m 32 now and I still remember it clearly and detailed, not just what she said or how she said it, but everything in that situation. The class room, my classmates, how I felt, the tension in the doom, how the light fell from windows, the stillness and silence in the classroom, the clock and how loud the ticking sounded in all that silent stillness, the facial expressions and body language of all the other students and then at the end how the atmosphere felt and how it changed and got all dark and scared and how everyone glanced fearfully at me and seemed to get even more still and quiet and kind of like sink down in their chairs to avoid her wrath. It was a very powerful moment. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to forget it. That was the first time I felt so strongly that I had messed up and was in a world of trouble for preforming well. But not the last! I had her for three years. Three awful horrible years of being bullied by a teacher for doing well and supposedly being a good girl. It has scared me.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That shit started way before high school for me. </p>\n\n<p>I vividly remember the teacher praising her favorites after we had had a test on the human body in school. I think I was 10 or 11. Anyway this teacher, she hated me from before we ever even met. For some reason she hated my family. She hated my older brother and treated him as crap and then she hated me and treated me like crap and then she hated my younger brother and treated him like crap. She now only allowed but actually encountered the bullying of my brothers and she openly bullied all of us. So this test on the human body, well one of her favorites got 95% and she stood in front of the entire class and gushed over her and her greatness for at least 15 minutes or so talking about how amazing and skilled and talented she was and on and on it went and the point of it was to make sure we all knew how much better than us her beloved favorite was. And when she was done with all that praise I guess she felt she had to mention that there was actually a higher score so she venomously spits out \u201cand yeah Gaiasdotter got 98\u201d and the way she said it was so hateful and she glared at me with pure hatred and disgust in a way that clearly told not just me but everyone that what I had done was unforgivable and I would pay for it! I\u2019m 32 now and I still remember it clearly and detailed, not just what she said or how she said it, but everything in that situation. The class room, my classmates, how I felt, the tension in the doom, how the light fell from windows, the stillness and silence in the classroom, the clock and how loud the ticking sounded in all that silent stillness, the facial expressions and body language of all the other students and then at the end how the atmosphere felt and how it changed and got all dark and scared and how everyone glanced fearfully at me and seemed to get even more still and quiet and kind of like sink down in their chairs to avoid her wrath. It was a very powerful moment. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to forget it. That was the first time I felt so strongly that I had messed up and was in a world of trouble for preforming well. But not the last! I had her for three years. Three awful horrible years of being bullied by a teacher for doing well and supposedly being a good girl. It has scared me.</p>\n</div>",

It took my mother going to the principal and throwing a fit, and showing the wireframes and assets to them all there to convince her I did this art, and it was as much art as photography (her pet subject).  I even had my drafting teacher (who taught us autocad) there to support me.</p>\n\n<p>It was really discouraging, and probably why it took until I was in my 20\u2019s to peruse art as a career.</p>\n</div>",

She was always so mean to me about it and said things to make me feel stupid all the time. Once I came into class late from the Resource Center and she called me out in front of the entire class! She stood up on my desk and yelled at me for being late and disrupting her class and she called me a \u201cstupid child who shouldn\u2019t have even gotten to move on to 3rd grade\u201d! That was the start of my severe anxiety disorder. No joke. Ever since then I\u2019ve had anxiety so bad I can\u2019t even explain how bad. I always feel like nobody thinks highly of me or they think I\u2019m stupid. I always do my best at everything I do, but I feel inadequate. Back then, after that happened with my 3rd grade teacher, she continued to bully me. I don\u2019t know how many times my parents were in the principals office complaining about that teacher for things she would say or do to me. One day at recess I didn\u2019t feel like playing because she had embarrassed me in class yet again. She came over and asked why I wasn\u2019t playing and I shrugged my shoulders. She said \u201coh you\u2019re too stupid to play?\u201d I tried to get up and leave and she said \u201coh no you aren\u2019t going anywhere\u201d and she SAT ON ME!!! And she was not a small woman! And it hurt! And I got out from under her and ran to the Resource Center and his under a table crying my eyes out! My mom came up to the school and she and the principal had a hard time getting me to come out from under that table. I was just so traumatized by that crazy woman! She ended up getting fired for that! But unfortunately my anxiety still remained and has to this day. I remember all of that like it was yesterday \ud83d\ude22",

Teachers who grade in such a subjective manner (I.E. \u201dThis is amazing work, but I feel like you should do better, so here\u2019s a shitty grade\u201d) only teach that the reward for hard work is harsh judgement of anything short of perfection.
