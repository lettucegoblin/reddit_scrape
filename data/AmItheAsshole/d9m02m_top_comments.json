My MIL initially had a hard time with this, but my wife finally explained that, in our eyes, a wedding is simply your friends and family coming together to celebrate your love for one another....the actual union is superfluous to us because we were already united in our eyes anyways.  A good example is celebrating the renewal of vows....it means jack shit.  That convinced her.  Now, we've been married over 10 years.  Maybe this anecdote will help, but we were at my in laws talking about our wedding and my MIL started about how beautiful the ceremony was and how amazing her cousin was at officiating and she was so glad that he got to marry us.  She didn't even remember so we didn't remind her.\n\nUltimately it's your marriage and none of the concern of either set of parents.  You had the ceremony for the benefit of yours and his family and the fact you were already married changes absolutely nothing in any way shape or form.\n\nAs far as the gifts, they are just that.  Even if you had forgone a wedding and told everyone that your were already married, would you be an asshole if they decided to send you a wedding gift to celebrate your marriage?  If you didn't even setup a registry then your MIL is obviously just butt-hurt that she didn't know and it sounds like she will eventually just move on.

It&#39;s fine to want a wedding but it was dishonest not to let people know what was up.  (That does NOT require you to reveal why you got married earlier.)  But people didn&#39;t witness a wedding, they showed up for a performance.  I think that matters.  Two people were NOT married during your recent ceremony.  Two previously married people reenacted a wedding.  </p>\n\n<p>Carol is a piece of work and threats about returning gifts and whatnot are ridiculous.

You are right that many people who are married already tell people, but those people aren\u2019t protecting confidential information. You might not think it\u2019s a big deal, but as someone who has dealt with chronic health issues of my own, the last thing you want to do is announce it to the whole world. It becomes all people ask you about when they see you and maybe she didn\u2019t want to worry the family members. It\u2019s still no ones business regardless. Why does this matter so much to this lady? They didn\u2019t do it to be spiteful. The mother in law is hella spiteful though for getting other family members involved and causing drama. We live in country with health care that\u2019s an absolute joke. Be mad at the system.</p>\n</div>",

I went to renew my driver's license last month and had the option of getting a Real ID. Only problem was, I didn't have my birth certificate. I'm 46 and had never even seen it -- ever. It's no big deal. I don't fly so I don't  really need a Real ID no matter how much they want to push them, and I live in the same county I was born so I could have gone to the courthouse if I did want one.

I&#39;m not religious, and couldn&#39;t stand the idea of any type of religious person officiating my wedding. My brother also had a quaker wedding, and he decided not to have an officiant. He and his wife stood together and made their promises to each other, and a few people did readings from literature about the nature of love. Both were beautiful and very much reflected the couples involved. I think everyone should have it as an option.</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019m a pre-T trans man and seeing his 2-hour video on HRT honestly rocked my world and it was so validating. My brain was like: Oh hey, look at this young, passionate guy who genuinely cares about trans people and making improvements to current treatments\u2014ideally the least invasive treatment possible\u2014to the point where he\u2019s going above and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>I finally have something to show my mom (who got caught up in TERF scare-rhetoric) that I genuinely think she\u2019ll listen to. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I love that guy. I wish he were my endo, but I have no desire to move to Michigan as a trans person lol....not the best laws there, unfortunately.</p>\n</div>",
