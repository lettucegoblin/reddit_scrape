This is probably the oldest story in the Bible, with the exception of the first few chapters of Genesis. In Job, Job believed and followed God. He was wealthy and had a great family. Satan went to God and argued that Job only followed God because he was so blessed, and that Job would turn away from God if he were to experience suffering. God disagreed. This was put to the test, and it was brutal. Job did not turn from God, Satan was proven wrong, and we, ages later, have lessons to learn.

This is after God and Job have discussed matters. God then spoke to Job's three friends who had accused him of doing wrong to earn such tragedy. He told them that they had not spoken the truth about God, He told them that He was angry with them. He told them to apologize to Job and to make offerings. And then, Job would have the opportunity to pray for their forgiveness, and then, \"I will surely accept his prayer and not deal with you as your folly deserves.\"\n\nYour former friend said the same thing that Job's friends had said. And God called them liars, and said that they deserved punishment.\n\nGod loves you, your friend, and your former friend. He does want each of you to follow Him. And there is zero evidence that He killed your friend's family as punishment for her unwillingness to believe in Him. You have the freedom to reject God; that freedom is messy, because it means that people are free to screw up the world. But it means that we're not slaves. He has invited us to be His friend.",

I want to say a few things that helped me grieve when I was struggling with religion. But first I want to send my deepest condolences.  No one deserves that kind of pain, and anyone who tries to blame it on the person grieving is flat out wrong. \n\nSo I had a friend who tragically died in a gun accident in college.  His best friend from childhood was one of my close friends and ended up crashing on my couch for months because being at home was too painful for him.  He is a hardcore atheist, believes lights out when you die, no afterlife.  At that point I was transitioning out of my Catholic faith into a more agnostic position.  Queue the confused grieving, guilt, questions, and poor attempts to comfort him.  There was no saying, \"he's in a better place\" and death outside a religious construct was hard to process.  But let me tell you, this kid is probably one of the smartest people I know.   Big philosophy fan, so we spent countless hours in the middle of the night bouncing ideas off each other.   I swear I'm getting to a point here.  \n\nThis experience shaped my worldview. I've fallen into two more secular views.  The socratic point of view and omnism.  To put it briefly, socraticism beliefs in the human condition.  You will never know what happens after we die, we will never be able to figure it out, and to find peace in the mystery of life.  Additionally, omnism is the belief in truth in all religions.  Each religion is a cultural observation of the world around us. They all have truths and they all miss the shot a little bit. Religion is a tool for humans to use to answer the most difficult questions. Originally it was used to explain natural disasters and mental illness, now it's trying to explain what happens after death, an unanswerable question.  \n\nI'll finish with this quote that gives me much peace, \n\n\"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\"  -Marcus Aurelius",

I don't think for a second that that's true.\n\nAlso, I always like to remember that the Bible was written by human beings and translated a million different times! Any passage could probably be interpreted in infinite ways depending on the translation and the person reading it. There is no need to dissect it for answers. What friend A needs is plenty of time to grieve, and friends like you who will help her do that in a way that fits her needs. Bringing up religion not only didn't help, but it also seemed to set her back in that grieving process. I can say confidently that, personally, my God wouldn't be proud of how friend B has represented Him. She should really think about whether she is religious for personal fulfillment, or just for show and to fuel a weird superiority complex.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, I'm getting very tired of losers giving religion (especially Christianity) a bad rep by being absolute assholes about it.",

Any passage could probably be interpreted in infinite ways depending on the translation and the person reading it. There is no need to dissect it for answers. What friend A needs is plenty of time to grieve, and friends like you who will help her do that in a way that fits her needs. Bringing up religion not only didn&#39;t help, but it also seemed to set her back in that grieving process. I can say confidently that, personally, my God wouldn&#39;t be proud of how friend B has represented Him. She should really think about whether she is religious for personal fulfillment, or just for show and to fuel a weird superiority complex.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant, I&#39;m getting very tired of losers giving religion (especially Christianity) a bad rep by being absolute assholes about it.</p>\n</div>",

When tragedy hits, it is not because you are not religious enough, not because you deserve it, not because Gd is punishing you. Through my study I have found Gd never puts a person in a position they cannot overcome. We are given free choice and have the power to pull through. In fact it is clear in teachings that Gd punishes both the wicked and the good. If the good are punished now, it means they will not be punished in the afterlife.\n\nSo Friend B, you may have a good life now, but damn, you're going straight to hell.",

So often, when we are dealing with loss like that, a single idea can cause a downward spiral. The comment your, now ex friend, made is a perfect example. Learning hundreds of people, think differently about the same situation, can be enlightening. </p>\n\n<p>She went down the rabbit hole, and you, with the help of reddit strangers, lifted her from that darkness. I hope, if I ever have a friend, in that situation, I can be the rock they need, like you have been for her.</p>\n</div>",

I was raised Christian and while I don't personally believe in God anymore, I do believe that a lot of the teachings of Jesus are good ones. Like love, compassion, kindness and forgiveness when the person repents. \n\nGod literally said after the Flood that he would never do that again. He would never punish the human race like that. Most non-radical Christians take that to mean he doesn't punish us. He is just disappointed when we mess up or push him away. In the same way as a good parent wouldn't kill a pet to make a point. Not meaning to compare a pet to her husband and child, but more meaning the parent-child relationship is the one to consider. \n\nYour 'friend' B should not be allowed back into your lives unless she is truly repentant for the things she said and the damage she hoped to cause. Your friend A did not deserve that. There is a lot of beautiful things in the Bible that may comfort her. Such as Ecclesiastes 3:1-13. It talks about how life and death is a gift from God and how we should appreciate what we have when it's good and mourn what we lost when we lose it. Obviously I don't believe in the religious aspects of it, but I have found comfort in the poem and hope your friend does too.",

His friends who tried to make him admit he had sinned to deserve what had happened to him are rebuked in the end by the Almighty Himself. \n\nThe whole point is that we do not understand why things happen to us, and it is not for us to understand.

The entire book of Job rebuts this idea, but Christ also responded to it directly:\n\n\u201cNow there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\u201d\u201d -Luke 13:1-5, wherein Jesus says clearly that misfortune is not a consequence of greater sin (and references several recent tragedies as examples to the audience)\n\nEdit - I mean to say, misfortune is not a symptom of excessive sin or guilt. I\u2019m not saying Bible God does not punish bad people. There was some confusion below over my vagueness so I\u2019m clarifying. Thanks to u/ShittyGuitarist for the great summary of my view\n\nAlso, u/awfullotofocelots points out that it\u2019s impossible to distinguish divine punishment from general misfortune. This is true. I\u2019m just pointing out that misfortune befalling you is not reason to be punished, and that there\u2019s a book of the Bible wherein a conversation like the one between A and B occurs and the attacking friend is condemned by God for saying something false. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to convert anyone, I just want to help OP\u2019s friend.

The entire book of Job rebuts this idea, but Christ also responded to it directly:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNow there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\u201d\u201d -Luke 13:1-5, wherein Jesus says clearly that misfortune is not a consequence of greater sin (and references several recent tragedies as examples to the audience)</p>\n\n<p>Edit - I mean to say, misfortune is not a symptom of excessive sin or guilt.

        "body": "Indeed. I mean it's a bit of a mess reading the Book of Job; the general opinion of scholars is that the book has no less than three authors, maybe more, having been written and re-written, probably because ancient people also found it difficult; that's basically what the book is about, how the rain falls on the just and unjust alike.\n\nI don't think I have the link saved anywhere but I have the transcription saved of a great sub-thread where someone very accurately tl;dr'd Job:\n\nbap521: What exactly is prosperity gospel?\n\nKiyuri: To put it simply, it's the idea that if you're a good christian, God will reward you with prosperity. This kind of thing is most often preached by televangelists and is often criticized for manipulating people into giving away their money under the guise of it being the \"christian\" thing to do.\n\nCadfan17: Or in other words, the literal opposite of the Book of Job.\n\nKiyuri: I'm actually not very familiar with the Book of Job. Could I ask for a brief explanation and how it relates to the prosperity gospel?\n\nCadfan17: Job is a rich guy with tons of bling. Hot wife, loads of kids, all kinds of stuff.\n\nGod and Satan are talking. Satan's like, \"Job only likes you cuz you gave him an easy life. Take it away and he won't like you anymore.\"\n\nGod's like, \"You're on. Lets fuck up his life.\"\n\nSo they do.\n\nNow the cliffnotes version of the story you'll hear in a shitty church is that Job remained faithful, so God gave Job all his shit back.\n\nThe ACTUAL version that's ACTUALLY in the Bible does not say that.\n\nIn the actual version God and Satan wreck Job's shit. Job is like, \"man, this... really sucks. I'm not being flippant here. My kids are all dead. I am... I am not in a good place right now.\"\n\nJob's friends show up and are like, \"DAMN, dude! God is seriously pissed at you! What did you DO?\"\n\nAnd Job says, \"Nothing, seriously. He just wrecked my life and killed everyone I loved for... as far as I can tell, literally no reason at all.\"\n\nAnd Job's friends are all, \"Ok, there's no way. God would only do this to you if you REALLY sinned. You'd better beg for forgiveness.\"\n\nAnd Job says, \"I've got no forgiveness to beg for. I didn't do anything. This all happened for no reason.\"\n\nAnd his friends, \"No, this definitely happened for a reason. God liked you so he gave you a good life, now God doesn't like you so he screwed your life up, obviously you sinned and he's angry with you, you need to apologize so he'll give you back the high life to which you were so sweetly accustomed.\"\n\nAnd Job says, \"No. I didn't do anything. I'm not apologizing for shit I didn't do.\"\n\nAnd his friends are like, \"Man, fuck you. Not only did you sin, like, MASSIVELY, you aren't even repentant. You suck. I don't know how we didn't notice this before.\"\n\nAnd then they bail on him because no one wants to hang out with a secret pedophile or whatever they thought Job was.\n\nSo Job sits there and is all, \"Ok... God? I'm not fooling here. I'm in pain. Do you not... do you not understand that people... hurt? \nWhen you hurt them? Do you not... get what suffering is? Do you not understand what you've... what you've done here? Are you just so far away that you... don't... understand how fragile we are? Or that you can't... care?\"\n\nSo God here's this and is SUPER PISSED. Because he just told Satan that Job was all pious and shit but now Job is calling him out. \nSo he shows up and SCREAMS at Job. He goes on this big rant about all the monster's he's killed and the things he's seen and how amazing he is and HOW FUCKING DARE JOB QUESTION HIM!!!11!!!one! He gets super into it, and REALLY threatening.\n\nAnd Job just falls on his face and begs forgiveness because seriously what else is he going to do, he doesn't think he can take God in a fight.\n\nSo God takes some deep breaths and counts to ten and goes to his happy place for a minute and gets himself under control again.\n\nThen he says, \"Ok, ok... so... we all gotta move on from here... Tell you what. You did tell the truth about me, back there. \nThat's worth something. You at least get me, even if you don't always RESPECT. So I'ma give you new women and kids and cows and shit. Not your old ones, Satan and I killed those. New ones though. These are gonna be better, I swear. And, what else. Oh yeah, your so called friends. They didn't tell the truth about me. So I'ma murder them all.\"\n\nAnd Job begs God not to do that, because Job really is a stand up guy, that's been established. And God lets them live.\n\nSo... the thing Job did that was telling the truth about God was stating that God sends good and evil to us without respect to our righteousness. And the thing that Job's friends did that was telling lies about God was claiming that God sends wealth and easy living to the righteous, and misery to the unrighteous.\n\nIn other words, the moral of Job is that if you believe in the prosperity gospel God will straight up ice you unless Job asks him to chill.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Indeed. I mean it&#39;s a bit of a mess reading the Book of Job; the general opinion of scholars is that the book has no less than three authors, maybe more, having been written and re-written, probably because ancient people also found it difficult; that&#39;s basically what the book is about, how the rain falls on the just and unjust alike.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think I have the link saved anywhere but I have the transcription saved of a great sub-thread where someone very accurately tl;dr&#39;d Job:</p>\n\n<p>bap521: What exactly is prosperity gospel?</p>\n\n<p>Kiyuri: To put it simply, it&#39;s the idea that if you&#39;re a good christian, God will reward you with prosperity. This kind of thing is most often preached by televangelists and is often criticized for manipulating people into giving away their money under the guise of it being the &quot;christian&quot; thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Cadfan17: Or in other words, the literal opposite of the Book of Job.</p>\n\n<p>Kiyuri: I&#39;m actually not very familiar with the Book of Job. Could I ask for a brief explanation and how it relates to the prosperity gospel?</p>\n\n<p>Cadfan17: Job is a rich guy with tons of bling. Hot wife, loads of kids, all kinds of stuff.</p>\n\n<p>God and Satan are talking. Satan&#39;s like, &quot;Job only likes you cuz you gave him an easy life. Take it away and he won&#39;t like you anymore.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>God&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re on. Lets fuck up his life.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So they do.</p>\n\n<p>Now the cliffnotes version of the story you&#39;ll hear in a shitty church is that Job remained faithful, so God gave Job all his shit back.</p>\n\n<p>The ACTUAL version that&#39;s ACTUALLY in the Bible does not say that.</p>\n\n<p>In the actual version God and Satan wreck Job&#39;s shit.

It supports the idea that bad things will not happen to them because they have done all the right things. It's a slightly less malignant version of prosperity gospel in which God is a slightly more autonomous slot machine (Prosperity Gospel= put in enough faith tokens and you'll win a pony!) \n\nIt is also extraordinarily toxic theology. You have already seen one aspect of it: it damaged your friend very badly when she is not even an all-in believer. But the other effect is the way it destroys its adherants' psyche. Your ex-friend us badly lacking in empathy because her belief system sees pain as earned and deserved. It has insulated her from the most basic form of human interaction and is destroying her relationships with anyone who is less than perfectly joyful. She likely has that same smug superiority these type of Christians retain on the regular that the rest of us find downright offensive. And when it's her turn to suffer misfortune--it happens. It happens to all of us--either she will go into a faith tail-spin that leaves her a wreck, searching for some imaginary sin to give her the illusion of control again, or her faith will shatter. If there is a living depiction of the house built on the sand, it is this exact type of believer. \n\nIn many ways our modern life insulates us from a great deal of human suffering. The majority of us are not suffering from starvation or true poverty. Those of us who are often feel very alone because of how rare it feels. When true disaster befalls one of us, the rest of us are uncomfortable and unsure because of how far beyond our experience it is. One profound example is that we assume that a mother will survive childbirth, and the child will live to grow up, and that if one or the other die, something has gone wrong. There are still people living for whom that was not true. For most of human history these two disasters were every day parts of life. We are unfamiliar with pain in a way unique to history. It is still there, but we are no longer ruled by it the way our ancestors were. To quote C. S. Lewis, \"all the great religions were first preached and long practiced in a world without chloroform.\" We live in a world where a pill can take away a headache or a tooth ache, and we keep those pills in a cabinet beside a sink of water that does not make us sick. I would say instead, we are ruled by our fear of pain. The further it recedes from our social mirror the more of a boogeyman it appears to be. And so we create grand defenses, and throw those who do know extreme pain under the bus so we never have to see just how hollow and useless those defenses are. \n\nI do not completely know why God allows us to go through darkness and agony. It is not because he does not love us, or because he is uncaring. It is not because he is powerless against it. I do believe it shows that God has an incredible faith in humans. He allows us to go through what we can endure. Pain does make its sufferers stronger. Its presence also allows for great pleasures. I have seen more and learned more while in pain than I have when I am neutral. And that positive product tells me that pain is not a punishment from God, bestowed as by a petty tyrant. Pain, greif, loss, are not a judgement of yourself as a person. They are an event to be weathered and survived. It may be that there is some grand goal at the end of all this that can only be meaningfully achieved by going down these broken roads we call life. Faith is not believing that God is punishing you; it is believing that he is not. It is trusting that you and he are on a journey to purpose together, that he has not and will not leave you, and that the storm is no more an error than the sunlit meadows you passed through to get here. \n\nI wish your friend comfort on her journey.",

Job did nothing wrong and when his family dies and he begins to suffer, his friends come out and tell him how mad God must be at him and that his suffering is his own fault--but the point is that they're judgmental and totally wrong. Therefore, assuming someone who is suffering must have sinned and doesn't deserve compassion is wrong.\n\nThat was the first angle on the story I heard that actually made some sense to me, although if it were *literally* true it would still be pretty cruel and giving Job everything back at the end is kind of a weird moral (unless maybe it's a metaphor for the rewards of heaven after suffering on earth? or maybe the author just felt bad for him by the end of the story, haha).",

        "body": "I'm going to speak to your second argument first. Speaking as someone who has struggled with suicidal depression and self harm most of my adult life, suicidal ideation is NOT caused by the burden of stress one person carries. It's a transitory state more along the lines of a diabetic seizure than it is a collection of logical thought. To think that you can prevent a suicidal episode by simply removing stress, or that you can trigger one by adding it, is a massive error. You have to handle the systemic issues the individual has, including the deep, subconscious errors in thought that, when triggered, cause suicidal ideation. I have been triggered into a suicidal episode when I have no stress at all, and I have endured extremely stressful situations without wanting to harm myself. The active cause has never been my circumstances, but how I am thinking and what specific thoughts occur in what sequence. A person who is suicidally depressed will continue to be so if you remove all burden of stress, because the problem is inside. We do not have a lot of tools that can fix this. CBT therapy is one. A correct understanding of what causes a thought process is necessary if we are ever going to get better tools. \n\nNow for the first argument: The question of a painless universe is rather meaningless because we would not be here to observe it. We being me, the person writing this, and you, the person reading it.\n\nYes, God absolutely could create a universe where there was no pain. There would also be no you, no me, and no one else sitting here reading reddit.  There probably would be no reddit. The existence of something we could recognize as a computer would be rather iffy. We are a product of our history, and our parents history. We are the product of the universe colliding in exact, specific ways. I have a daughter who exists, in part, because of a lot of painful and unpleasant choices I made. And I love her so much that I would joyfully put not just myself, but everyone else I know through those same awful events. I would feel very grieved for the pain it would cause, but I would rather have the flawed and painful universe that created her than a painless, successful life without her. The important question is not \"can God make a painless universe\" but \"Can God make me, specifically, in a painless universe? And if he could, could he then also make you?\" Because it isn't abstract humanity who has value. It's specific humanity. You. Specifically you. Would you be who you are without the events, memories and scars that brought you here? I wouldn't be me if you erased my pain, and I wouldn't have my child. I would not exist if you erased my mother's pain, and neither would my brother or his child. We aren't the products of perfect relationships in a perfect world, and it makes no sense to assume that we ever could be. And so again, The question of a painless universe cannot be answered because we would not exist to observe it. There would likely be beings, and they might even be recognizable as human, but they most certainly would not be you or me.",
