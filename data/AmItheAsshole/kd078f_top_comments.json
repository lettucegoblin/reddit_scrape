I find it a little odd that you yourself didn't have uncomfortable feelings in making the post. Your comments here make it sound like you haven't really thought about it much, and that makes me wonder if you have really dealt with it. \n\nSomeone already suggested marriage counseling, but I wonder about individual therapy too. At a minimum, it may help you navigate this social dynamic and how it has impacted your relationships with both of your families since the wedding. And who knows, once you start doing the work, you may find that you are having your own emotional struggle that you have just been tamping down as a coping mechanism. \n\nEveryone else sucks for not considering you married and expecting you to either \"redo\" or thinking you are a vain asshole if you decide to \"redo\". This is not a common situation, so it isn't a surprise that no one is handling it well. I'm so sorry for all of your suffering. I think you need help several paygrades above reddit to help you move forward.  \n\nMany counselors and insurance are offering telehealth services now, if that is a concern, and if you can't afford traditional therapy, there are many app based video counselors available for less cost. \n\nI wish you and your family healing.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>ESH</p>\n\n<p>You are allowed to celebrate your anniversary, and even publicly, but this is the first year. I find it a little odd that you yourself didn&#39;t have uncomfortable feelings in making the post. Your comments here make it sound like you haven&#39;t really thought about it much, and that makes me wonder if you have really dealt with it. </p>\n\n<p>Someone already suggested marriage counseling, but I wonder about individual therapy too. At a minimum, it may help you navigate this social dynamic and how it has impacted your relationships with both of your families since the wedding. And who knows, once you start doing the work, you may find that you are having your own emotional struggle that you have just been tamping down as a coping mechanism. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone else sucks for not considering you married and expecting you to either &quot;redo&quot; or thinking you are a vain asshole if you decide to &quot;redo&quot;. This is not a common situation, so it isn&#39;t a surprise that no one is handling it well. I&#39;m so sorry for all of your suffering.

It's not op's fault that the child died because the parents let a kid that didn't know how to swim in a event where there was a lake and left that child unsupervised. If you weren't going to pay attention to your child on a wedding, leave them at home with a babysitter. Like, I get it, you turn around for a minute and a kid can desapear, and I don't blame them, accidents happens, but they are still negligent in this case. And asking other people not to celebrate weddings, anniversaries, birthdays or anything of the sorts because you or someone else may have suffered a tragedy on that day it's entitled as fuck. So what, a little girl couldn't celebrate her birthday on Semtemper 9th in 2002 because her uncle died in 9/11? You can't celebrate Christmas with your family and post in on social media because a grandparent died during the holidays? If we were to stop celebrating a day because a tragedy happened that day to someone you know, we couldn't celebrate anything.\nThey were clearly projecting their guilt into OP. When they saw the post and got triggered, they could have talk to a therapist, family or friend, or ignore the post, talk to op in private explaining her feelings, unfollow them or even blocked them, but no, they chose to complain on social media that OP didn't honor their child in the post (honey, no, that's your job). And even if op have done that, they could have still be angry at her because she posted about their child for likes (like someone said in other comments) and still be angry. They clearly have misplaced guilt and are blaming OP and her wedding for the death of their child because they need someone to blame that isn't themselves.\nAnd about the in-laws, if I were you, they either back off or I would cut ties. If I have the papers, I consummated the marriage, my marriage is legal. Screw them.\nThis comment section is a disaster.

My grandmother's father died very suddenly the morning after her wedding - he went to bed after the wedding and didn't wake up. He was not yet 50 years old. This was a disaster for the family, and everyone was plunged into mourning, and wondered whether the strenuous dancing at the wedding caused it... To this day my grandmother does not look at her wedding album and does not speak of her wedding. But my grandparents did not have a second party for their marriage. They were married, and that was that. Sometimes wedding days suck, for terrible reasons, and there's no redo, but the marriage stands. I think your husband's family will never be interested in celebrating your anniversary with you, but with time they'll accept that you two are married.",

Acknowledging that their wedding happened and the actual day it happened (which will never change) is a valid way of coping. Acceptance is a valid way of coping, even if it doesn\u2019t seem as somber as others want. OP needs to not broadcast the event to the parents, but the parents have obviously not processed it well. They are also not required to cope from acceptance. But staying as Facebook friends with folks who they don\u2019t know well, and whose entire relationship had a nexus to their child\u2019s death, is maybe not best.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is an important comment. Without playing trauma olympics, everyone at that event, <em>including</em> OP and their spouse, is going to have trauma from this. Acknowledging that their wedding happened and the actual day it happened (which will never change) is a valid way of coping. Acceptance is a valid way of coping, even if it doesn\u2019t seem as somber as others want. OP needs to not broadcast the event to the parents, but the parents have obviously not processed it well. They are also not required to cope from acceptance. But staying as Facebook friends with folks who they don\u2019t know well, and whose entire relationship had a nexus to their child\u2019s death, is maybe not best.</p>\n</div>",

Thanks to covid theyve mostly been shut down but a few weeks after the funeral, a store my brother visited a lot private messaged me and asked to have my mother stop by bc they had 'something' for her. I told them that she wouldn't be ready to go there for a long time bc of the memories she shared with my brother there but that I would be happy to pick it up for her. They cheerfully messaged back that they would wait until she was ready. It turns out that they had a placque made in his honor and wanted to take a picture with it and my mother. Ill never step foot into that store again after the way they tried to coerce a big public grief reaction out of my mother.",
