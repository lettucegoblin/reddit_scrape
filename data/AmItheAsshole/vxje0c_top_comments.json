Not sure why, since it doesn\u2019t affect anyone but my husband and myself, but boy howdy do they and will say all kinds of shit both before and following finding out. My husband,\non the other hand? Thrilled. Beyond proud. Would never let anyone talk bad about me. \n\nMy advice to you is to only date someone who will **enthusiastically** defend you. I smoke too much weed to believe that suddenly it made your boyfriend spineless to one group of people, but not you. You want someone who\u2019s not only going to forcefully tell people that they may NOT disrespect you by calling you mean names, but who is going to brag on you. \n\nWhat your boyfriend should have said is, \u201cNot only is she not a gold digger, this rich bitch is my sugar mama! You\u2019re only talking shit bc you\u2019re jealous.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re in a good position in life, especially for a woman. There\u2019ll be people who are mad about that. Don\u2019t waste your life with people who want you to be less-than. \n\nNot saying you should dump your boyfriend, but it should be clear to him that you won\u2019t be with someone who disrespects and allows others to disrespect you. You\u2019ll be happier. NTA, at all.",

Not sure why, since it doesn\u2019t affect anyone but my husband and myself, but boy howdy do they and will say all kinds of shit both before and following finding out. My husband,\non the other hand? Thrilled. Beyond proud. Would never let anyone talk bad about me. </p>\n\n<p>My advice to you is to only date someone who will <strong>enthusiastically</strong> defend you. I smoke too much weed to believe that suddenly it made your boyfriend spineless to one group of people, but not you. You want someone who\u2019s not only going to forcefully tell people that they may NOT disrespect you by calling you mean names, but who is going to brag on you. </p>\n\n<p>What your boyfriend should have said is, \u201cNot only is she not a gold digger, this rich bitch is my sugar mama! You\u2019re only talking shit bc you\u2019re jealous.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re in a good position in life, especially for a woman. There\u2019ll be people who are mad about that.

One of my professors was way smarter and more accomplished than her husband and they worked in the same department.  Not to mention very cute if they ever walkout together.  She put her arms around his.  She was a tiny cute little thing that never backs down if you argue about grades.\n\nI get that he was high so he failed to respond.  Not a big deal at all.  Feeling insulted and humiliated is just dumb.  As matter of fact this should be bragging rights.  Yeah suckers, got me an outgoing girl, smart and makes more money than all of you.

Some people will not respect you no matter how many talks you have with them. They simply don\u2019t have much empathy for you and you can\u2019t teach them that. The fact that he doubled down and got embarrassed for you rightfully standing up for yourself \u2014 I\u2019d cut your losses <a href=\"/u/notAGoldDiggerX\">u/notAGoldDiggerX</a>. Also his friends says a lot about who he is. A relationship without mutual respect is not one worth having. Imagine all the boundaries that will be broken, all the time. The resentment will just build and build. You\u2019ll keep trying and then realize one day you can\u2019t do it anymore and that you wasted all your time. Respect and boundaries are needed in any relationship.</p>\n</div>",

I myself am a welder,  I work with my hands not really my head but I'm not stupid by any means. My lovely wife is in buisnesess analytics/ data engineering and she's working on getting her title to reflect what she really does which is data architecture.\n\nTo say it simply, my wife makes very literally 2.5 times what I do at my BEST wages I can get for my field in my area. All of her male coworkers that aren't a part of her department treat her like she's just there because she's cute (don't get me wrong she's adorable), her actual department fully recognized right away that she's brilliant and will change the way their company functions and handles their data.\n\nWhen she would come to my work events, NOBODY would talk to her or even ask her anything about herself. I am not shy if people ask I will tell them right away my wife is the brains and the money I am just hands. But they will get SHOCKED when she does speak and they can't even follow because honestly they're idiots.\n\nWhen I have gone to her work functions in the past her coworkers look at me the way most IT look at women. Like I'm some dumb oaf who barely gets his own pants on and I must be so lucky to have married someone with money. Then they talk with me and every damn time they'll go \"oh I had no idea he was smart\" ????\n\nLike as If she would only be with an idiot who can fix things for her or something idk, I think they all have a very skewed view of reality. Plus they're entirely wrong about us anyways so we just got used to it sadly.\n\nWe both have known each other since middleschool, we got together when we were both broke (she was still in school I was minimum wage) and together we got ourselves to where we are.\n\nBut all they see is a dumb quiet guy who's dirty sometimes, and a cute woman in a suit who makes real money. Pretty annoying.",

Everything we do is for us and our future not our own personal agenda. My wife doesn't like to do a lot of the physical stuff because she is very smol and delicate, she is also factually weak physically. \n\nLike I've watched her struggle to open chapstick, it's adorable.\n\nBut she's also so insightful and perceptive she understands people better than they do, she's so organized she can even make my mess seem to make sense (adhd go brrrt!). She's so intelligent she makes other people nervous because they feel stupid trying to keep up with her. She's the most caring and understanding person I have ever met, she was the first person to ever show me true compassion and understanding. She has helped me through so many things in life and I have done the same for her even though I don't feel I've done anything.\n\nWe value eachother more than anyone else could ever hope to. I am blessed everyday to even know her let alone be married to this perfect (in my mind) woman l, and she weirdly feels the same about me. I tell her all the time she settling lol.\n\nBut anyways, when we were dating we worked out how we'd split things, everything is mostly 50/50 but sometimes not. I am totally fine doing our physical chores while she helps maintain the mental stuff, but NEITHER of us are confined to that. She helps me with chores and I help her with planning and bills and such.\n\nThere is no \"this is her job, this is my job\" everything is our job together. We bought a house together and plan to have kids hopefully starting next year. We talk about everything, I mean everything. Long before we even agreed to have the kids we talked about how we'd raise them. We discuss our views on things openly and without fear of the other disagreeing because we can always find a compromise or understanding.\n\nI treat her the way I believe she deserves to be treated.\n\nThis is what my wife says on the matter (to help cut down my rambling): I try to not focus on external expectations because those harsh standards swing both ways. I dont want to deal with standards society has for women therefore I don't believe I can impose those standards on others. My father told me that life is going to be hard, you have loss and struggle, some of which is unique to yourself and you need to pick a person that can help you with those issues personal and in general. For me, I struggle with depression and anxiety. I was at a low point where I was on a watch at the beginning of last year, my husband was prepared to quit his job and any consequences that entailed if that meant I was going to make through the day. He didn't care if we both quit and had to struggle for a bit as long as we make it to the other side. He geninuely cares for my wellbeing and I try to return the favor.\n\nOverall life is a long and hard journey, and we made sure to choose a partner who is willing to face it all with us. If the world wanted to fight, we're in eachothers corner.",

After a while my gf said she thought I was depressed because I wasn&#39;t interacting with people. Basically, take daughter to school, come home Netflix for a while, do home projects for a while, pick daughter up.</p>\n\n<p>I started back to work after a couple of years. Had someone call that I worked with 10+ years back and they were looking for someone for 3 month gig as a director replace while the current one was on maternity leave. She came back after 3 months and wanted me to stay as a firmware engineer. 3 years and 4 months for a 3 month temp.</p>\n</div>",
