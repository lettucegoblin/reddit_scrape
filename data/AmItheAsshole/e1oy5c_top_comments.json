Bake cookies together. Torrent some Christmas movies. Buy her a nice sweater at a thrift store or something if it feels like there needs to be a gift for the holiday to count.

Christmas isn\u2019t just about presents, and there\u2019s still so many things you can do with your family to make it special and to make memories with your daughter for her second Christmas. \n\nIf you own decorations it won\u2019t cost any money to put them up, and I bet your two year old will love the tree. And maybe your wife might like the decorations too, instead of having to ignore the holiday and not being able to celebrate. And wouldn\u2019t it be nice to decorate with your wife and daughter? What about baking some Christmas cookies? Daughter would surely love that. Watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer on TV? Sitting down on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day to eat a meal\u2014not even an expensive one if you can\u2019t afford it\u2014with your family to celebrate and cherish the things in your life to be thankful for\u2014your wife, your daughter, their health, etc. Or you could have a family day in your pajamas and make hot cocoa and hang out all together on the couch, or play a game... You could read your daughter a story. \n\nAnd honestly, there are options for gifts if it\u2019s really eating at you. For example the dollar store sells little teddy bears, coloring books and crayons, stickers, etc for a dollar a piece as well as gift bags and such, and your daughter is two\u2014she wouldn\u2019t know the difference between a $1 toy and a $30 toy, and if you could spare $10 you could get her a few things to open on Christmas morning. Or if not, you could go to your local church, look into Toys for Tots\u2014there\u2019s charities to support families who need groceries around Christmas or who can\u2019t afford to buy gifts for their children. \n\nFor your wife you could give her a massage, or write her a love letter, or watch your daughter for a day so your wife can have some alone time to pamper herself, etc. \n\nSome cities have big displays of lights that you could go see as a family\u2014romantic for you and wife, or exciting to go as a family for daughter. Some libraries and schools have Christmas events like craft fairs, bake sales, story times, some towns have tree lighting events... These are things you could go to with your family, maybe get one special new ornament for a couple dollars from a fair to put on the tree to mark daughter\u2019s second Christmas, or take a picture of the family in front of a Christmas tree. \n\nAlso I was going to suggest volunteering at a soup kitchen or donating some food\u2014canned cranberry sauce and canned vegetables maybe, to a local food pantry. I don\u2019t know if you can afford to do that or not or if you are struggling to afford food yourself, but just wanted to point out that this could be a valuable tradition to start for your family for the holidays. If you can afford it, you could bring a few cans to a donation center with wife and daughter, and tell daughter you\u2019re giving food to hungry people who need it\u2014repeating his year after year to reinforce that Christmas isn\u2019t about gifts, the importance of helping those in need, of being thankful for what you have, etc. Again, you might not be able to afford that\u2014if you\u2019re struggling to buy groceries for your family, look into one of these food pantries for your own needs\u2014but just a way to acknowledge the holidays in a way that doesn\u2019t revolve around spending hundreds on presents and materialism and Santa. \n\nNot sure if you\u2019re religious but of course you could go to church on Christmas if you are. \n\nSo a gentle YTA. Financial difficulties are awful and I understand your feelings, but don\u2019t deprive yourself and your family of Christmas and special memories just because of your insecurities. If your family is struggling that might be all the more reason to celebrate however you can. Personally if I were your wife I would be sad to see everyone else\u2019s decorations and hear Christmas music and such only to go home to my own house without so much as the decorations you already own because Christmas is \u201ccancelled.\u201d Show your wife and daughter that you know what\u2019s really important, and remember that just because our capitalistic society has made Christmas materialistic and stressful, that\u2019s not what the season is about. Life is hard and short\u2014don\u2019t be the Grinch. Make the most of Christmas with your family.",

I understand the feelings of shame, you see other people who have done the right thing financially and you wonder why you are a failure. But I am sorry friend, the situation you are in is exactly what we would expect under the system you are under. by the way, this is not normal.\n\nAllow me to explain, I come from another country. Yesterday a co-worker came to the office in a fit. She was angry about a report in the news stating that there were 1000 homeless people here, and that the government was incompetent and monsterous for letting it happen. I got mad too, and starting writing a letter to my elected representative critisizing her for allowing this to happen and that we pay taxes so this nonsense doesnt happen. I ended it by saying the rainy season was coming up and though we live in a tropical climate, it would be inconvienient if they got wet, and she should get off her lazy ass and do her fricking job. thankfully I realized i may have been overreacting, 1000 in a city of 5million is still pretty ok, and sent a much kinder email. unfortunately I believe that many of my countrymen may not have been so kind.\n\nContrast this to where you live, where your healthcare, education and housing continues to move in crazy upwards trajectories. Where I am from, tax dollars pay for low cost housing, where most of the population lives (80%), there is also a fair healthcare and very low cost education system. This means that people have additional funds to start businesses and invest, the things that allow a nation to prosper. This has lead to a situation where 1 in 8 people are millionaires. \n\nFor whatever reason, you have managed to be tricked into believing that this is your fault. It is not. We live in societies for the very reason that should prevent these sorts of things from happening, where you can have a full time job and still be in the situation you are in somehow. Thankfully you have a good salary, but your system is punitative and your representatives need to do better and invest in your people, you know by using the money you give them to build housing instead of ammunition.",

Give yourself grace and let yourself have hope. At this age the only thing you are really giving your kiddo is memories. Kiddo won't remember toys, but she might have an impression of feelings. \n\nThe earliest Christmas I remember was awesome. I was about 3. We made popcorn strings and paper chains and sang songs. I remember being so excited about Christmas. And I am sure we had some gifts to open from Grandma and Grandpa and aunts and uncles though I couldn't tell you what I got.\n\nLooking back on it I don't remember the gift stuff at all. All I clearly remember is making the popcorn strings and paper chains with my mom and thinking our tree was so beautiful. There is *no way* my mom was able to afford gifts. We'd made a late night escape (I do remember this part) from her very very awful abusive fiance a few weeks before. She had been a single mom working two part-time jobs and we were living in a shitty apartment In a nearby city--she would have spent all her money on deposits and rent and been looking for jobs at the time.\n\nWe were \"Christmas Hamper charity poor\" throughout my childhood so I got a lot of generic \"girl aged X-X\" gifts. I actually now as an adult don't really like giving or receiving gifts at all. But I love the holidays. The emphasis on family and togetherness. \n\nWe would bake sugar cookies and do little crafts like making stars out of twigs and go for walks outside with a thermos of hot chocolate to look at lights. I'm planning on making popcorn strings with my 3 year old this year.\n\nGo to your library. Take out some Xmas movies and books. Go to your food pantry and find out about Christmas hampers. My daughter was 2 last year and the best thing she got was a giant box to play in with crayons and markers. Spend time with your wife. Drink tea by the Xmas lights and talk about your favorite holiday memory. Bask in love. It's free. And multiplies.\n\nGive yourself permission to have a good holiday season. Dr. Seuss said it best: *Christmas doesn't come from a store... Christmas...means just a little bit more*\n\nMerry Christmas man, I hope you find peace, love, joy and hope this holiday season.",

There\u2019s so many things to do that don\u2019t have to cost (or have a very minimal cost).</p>\n\n<p>I hope you can see passed this difficult time and know itll get better. I certainly hope they get better for you. \ud83d\udda4</p>\n</div>",

A loving family at home with you even at your lowest point (of which this is far from it but still I feel your pain here). Being broke because you gotta catch up with your bills is far from being destitute my friend.</p>\n</div>",

I have always hated getting gifts because most people were so off the mark. I love Christmas because of the lights, decorations, carols, movies, wood burning fires, apple cider everything, Christmas parties, etc.\n     Christmas presents don\u2019t have too cost much if anything. You could take old cereal boxes and paint them or cover them in brown paper to make large building blocks for your child to play with. Or if you have bigger boxes you can take markers and turn them into a play castle. A cheap bottle of bubbles from the dollar store would probably delight her. Or you could take some old socks and make her some sock puppets (use some old buttons laying around for eyes, permanent marker mouth, etc.) There are TONS or tutorials online for things you can make from reusing items. Maybe take some of her outgrown baby clothes and make her a blanket out of them, or turn some old shirts into a stuffed animal. Not having kids, I don\u2019t know if a 2 year old would try and eat them but you could string some popcorn together to make a necklace and bracelet. Make it sparkly by putting glue on it and then sprinkling glitter all over it.\n         For your wife you can still do something special. I know there is a way to use flour and salt and other stuff to make Christmas ornaments that are hardened by baking in the oven. Your daughter could help with making them and once they are baked she could then decorate them with paint or markers. Of all of things my husband has ever given me over the years the most precious to me are the handwritten letters he sent me when we were dating and lived fours hours apart. Most were just written on some lined yellow legal paper when work was slow. Write your wife a nice letter with all of the reasons why you love her, appreciate her, why you think she is an awesome amazing woman, what little quirks she has that you think adorable,etc. Trust me, it will mean more to her than anything you could go out and buy.\n        For Christmas decorations you can make old school paper chains from construction paper. Father pine cones from outside and spread glue on the edges and then sprinkle with glitter. String some popcorn. Again there are a ton of tutorials for taking what you already have around the house and yard and turning them into decor.",

They've never received an x-box or whatever, but they have had some freaking awesome experiences together for the holidays.  I dislike the consumerism, because so many people are made to feel like you. Make christmas the day you snuggle. You could give a two year old empty boxes and she'd be excited.  I mean you could also get her a big box to play in and paint it like a castle. She will LOVE that. And you will know you gave her something that made her smile. You can get a tiara for her and your wife for a dollar, or make them and make a crown for yourself and then you will all laugh around that castle together.  Being a great parent isn't about the shit they show you on TV about making christmas special.  It's enjoying life with your kid through the hardship.  Also, if you are religious, make worship your tradition. Do whatever works for you but it doesn't have to have anything to do with what you can spend.  You are doing your best, man.

Decorate, sing the holiday song and celebrate your daughter. At the age of 2 playing with Mommy and Daddy, spending time with them is all she will need and believe me, this she will remember.

Our society is so consumer focused that I feel like many people have forgotten how to create and appreciate simple things. Can you find a big box and create a play house for her? Write your wife a love letter with everything you love about her. Make \"coupons\" for \"one special day with Daddy\", \"Husband makes dinner\", \"one massage\", etc. Do you have WIC? If not, go apply or at least ask for resources if you're in need of food. Open the pantry and tell your daughter for Christmas, she can choose ANY meal she wants for dinner. Go to the park and play together. I understand the parental and provider guilt. I've been there. But I promise you, kids care so much more about simple little things. The one Christmas my husband and I overdid it, our kids were burnt out. But the ones where I've been broke and xmas was very basic... the kids went nuts. I also bet you your wife will cherish the love letter she can read over and over more than any diamond necklace or whatever else you could possibly buy her.

Our society is so consumer focused that I feel like many people have forgotten how to create and appreciate simple things. Can you find a big box and create a play house for her? Write your wife a love letter with everything you love about her. Make &quot;coupons&quot; for &quot;one special day with Daddy&quot;, &quot;Husband makes dinner&quot;, &quot;one massage&quot;, etc. Do you have WIC? If not, go apply or at least ask for resources if you&#39;re in need of food. Open the pantry and tell your daughter for Christmas, she can choose ANY meal she wants for dinner. Go to the park and play together. I understand the parental and provider guilt. I&#39;ve been there. But I promise you, kids care so much more about simple little things. The one Christmas my husband and I overdid it, our kids were burnt out. But the ones where I&#39;ve been broke and xmas was very basic... the kids went nuts. I also bet you your wife will cherish the love letter she can read over and over more than any diamond necklace or whatever else you could possibly buy her. It also shows that despite the circumstances, you still put the effort and thought and time and love in for her. She will look back at this difficult year and smile.</p>\n</div>",

I really appreciated it, even though I didn't play with dolls that much - it's the thought that counts. If you really feel that you need to give a gift, maybe try DIY-ing a toy from stuff around the house, or something you can pick up from garden piles. I've made some nice picture frames with cardboard, flip-file plastic, and roadside flowers. I printed the picture at work, so it didn't cost me much (like, 15 cents?). That could be a good idea for something to give your wife. I always try to DIY gifts, so you are welcome to send me a message if you want for some ideas. I've also turned water bottles into a hanging garden, with plants I proplifted from gardens (check out r/proplifting). You can even make a hanging mobile from bottle plastic or cardboard or plywood - it's easy to work with, and quite versatile. One of my favourite childhood activities was making doormats with my mom from plaited palm leaves, and it's super easy to do. Sometimes we painted them with some food colouring beforehand to give some nice patterning.  You can also make play dough from flour, water, salt, and food colouring, or you can make a dollhouse with cardboard boxes.

I truly hope this thread helps OP see he can still have love and a lovely Christmas that takes him back to basics. And maybe carry that into their lives and help simplify! This year we had to tell the kids (teenagers) that money isn't really there for things like last year. Last year was epic, this year we're suddenly in trouble. They just didn't care. They are happy with the tree being beautiful, making cookies together, scoring cheap tickets to go see the holiday lights etc. Just try a little and let those around you surprise you with how ok they are with it.",

I took out the first 3 seasons, then once I was caught up I watched it in real time. They have every season of basically every show ever, I've watched The Wire, Homeland, House of Cards, Billions 100% thru my library. I also like having the BluRay/DVD because it gives me access to the extras, episode commentaries and deleted scenes. They have new movies at about the same time Redbox gets them. I have one of the newer phones on the market, so that's fine for everything else. Every 4-8 months, I pay for one month of Netflix, HBOgo or Showtime to catch up on stuff I couldnt get at library. And since i dont have those services year around, I have a decent selection of stuff that's new to me to watch when I do buy the service. I only play single player games so I just bring my playstation to work once a month to update it.
