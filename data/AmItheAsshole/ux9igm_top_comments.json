I'm pretty conflicted about it, but I just can't help but feel like some things are being left out (even if it's not on purpose).\n\n>One day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren\u2019t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.\n\nIdk...this just doesn't seem like something just friends would do (ESPECIALLY if OP is male). I've had a female friend pretend to propose to me before (I'm also female), but I can't see a male friend ever doing that. And actually giving each other a \"ring\"? This is leaning towards more than just friends to me. Even if they never actually dated, I'm kind of getting the feeling that there was something more there. Since OP's friend passed so young, I'm wondering if maybe they never got the chance to figure everything out (which is honestly heartbreaking and I feel so sorry for OP). \n\nI can't help but fear that OP's deceased friend is OP's \"white moonlight\" (that's a Chinese Internet slang term for a person someone loved once and still cherishes even though they're no longer together, to the point that no one else can compare). OP's comments about their discussions with their therapist make me fear this even more. Even if OP may not realize it, I wonder if they're making their deceased friend a sort of third wheel in their relationship. OP's girlfriend may feel like they're always being compared to OP's friend and falling short. It doesn't help that OP's deceased friend now only lives in OP's memory, so they're probably viewed in a more favorable light, and OP's girlfriend is only human and makes mistakes like we all do. Obviously, I don't have concrete proof for this, but I'm kind of sensing it just reading through the lines.\n\nTo make a long story short, I don't think there's anything wrong with remembering a close friend, but I think that OP needs to be very careful in how they do so. I'm no expert on grief beyond having experienced it, but I think that remembering their deceased friend on just one day and occasionally reminiscing about her is ok. However, if her memory is taking over OP's life and hurting their current relationship, that just doesn't seem healthy for anyone. OP should have an open and honest talk with their girlfriend about this whole situation. It wasn't ok for her to explode like that, but it sounds like it's been bothering her for a while and she just couldn't contain it anymore. Hopefully talking with her will prevent her from saying such hurtful things again and help set them both up for a healthier relationship regarding this issue.",

Yes the girl was your best friend but the fact is yes she is dead and you have a girlfriend that really loves you or else she wouldn\u2019t be feeling the way she is feeling, grief never fully goes away but living in the present is also very important, if you love your girlfriend make sure she knows or just end it if you feel like she isn\u2019t the one rather than just stringing on a relationship because of you honoring a fake marriage with a dead best friend with making your girlfriend like she is worth your time I think it\u2019s best to take a step back and reevaluate what is important in your life in the present time not the past.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA but it seems like your current girlfriend really feels neglected in your current relationship, it seems like you haven\u2019t entertained the thought on marrying her so she feels like she comes second to your life. Yes the girl was your best friend but the fact is yes she is dead and you have a girlfriend that really loves you or else she wouldn\u2019t be feeling the way she is feeling, grief never fully goes away but living in the present is also very important, if you love your girlfriend make sure she knows or just end it if you feel like she isn\u2019t the one rather than just stringing on a relationship because of you honoring a fake marriage with a dead best friend with making your girlfriend like she is worth your time I think it\u2019s best to take a step back and reevaluate what is important in your life in the present time not the past.

It sounds like the reason you haven't told your girlfriend more is cuz you think she'd be jealous, but according to you she has nothing to be jealous of, so it's a bit confusing. I'd wager that this is why she's mad now, because she expected to hear more about how important this person was to you and why it's important to keep it up, but you haven't been forthcoming and so it makes her feel like more went on than just the platonic relationship you described.\n\nAdditionally, I'm a bit confused about why you asked for permission if you weren't prepared to stop. Not that you should have to, based on how you described it I think it's a pretty harmless tradition, but again this is how you chose to handle it and it's directly led to this result.\n\nOverall, I think you need to sit down and have another talk with your girlfriend and try to get to the root of the issue.

Most people keep the happy memories of the dearly departed but don't feel the need to actively engage in activities for them, especially at the expense of current relationships that you objectively get more out of at the present moment. Losing your best friend like that at a young age is traumatic, and if you still feel this strongly about it, an appointment with a grief counselor may be a good way for you to work through why it's still so important to you.

She's said that she doesn't like it, and left for a week, seems pretty cut and dried to me that if he wishes to continue the tradition then she is done with the relationship,  there's nothing wrong with that if it is the case.

What she doesn't like is you excluding her and making her a third person. \n\n\u2022 Secondly, if you are still referring to the date as a \"wedding anniversary\" then well your gf should really just get out of your life because even tho you're honouring a dead person's wish, you're compromising your future with your gf. You cant be stuck in the past just because your bestfriend asked you too. You were in highschool back then, you're all grown up now. If you're still stuck with the same unhealthy coping mechanism then it just means you're in regression stage i.e stuck in one stage.\n\n\u2022 Thirdly, according to Bowlby's 5 stages of grief, it seems to me that you certainly are stuck in one of the stages and not moving past the acceptance stage. Because you are doing what your bestfriend would have liked THEN. do you think she would like it if you're compromising your current relationship because of what she said? She was just a high scholar too back then and she was dying but that surely isn't an excuse for you to be compromising your future and if you are then you are in serious need of therapy.\n\n\u2022 You also say that she always comes first,that to me is quite peculiar as again, you're compromising on your future by being stuck in the past. I would understand if it were a parent or guardian but for a best friend no matter how close i dont quite get it (again just my opinion)\n\nLastly, there are other ways to mourn. If you would have moved on from it, you would be willing to talk about it with your gf even if little details. The fact that you're keeping it all to yourself and going to lengths to remove her pictures just suggest that you surely haven't and there are still certain feelings involved.",

But honoring a nonrelative of the opposite sex on your fake wedding anniversary with a scrunchie that serves as an engagement ring of sorts while not marrying ur current gf would nearly make any girl feel uncomfortable. Your gf probably found it sweet and a sign of commitment at first but as the years go by and she has no real engagement, feelings r gonna sour. \n\nIf you honored your friend on her birthday, the day she died, etc it would be different, but you honor it on your fake wedding anniversary.

What do her parents or other friends do? \n\nAgain, Ik nothing outside of what you\u2019ve written but it seems resentment is growing and if you guys can\u2019t talk about a future together, then cut her loose.

A week away is a girl&#39;s way of saying &quot; I need to reevaluate this relationship&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Know ones saying you can&#39;t remember her, you can&#39;t visit but this &quot;marriage&quot; thing needs to stop</p>\n</div>",

And it's not like I avoid her for the rest of the day or make her feel like I'm still thinking about my best friend.\n\nHe puts his GF first - above his visit to his dead friend. He communicated that pretty clearly. Does that sound like a neglectful, unloving partner?\n\nThere's plenty of posts on AITA about people who are, frankly, unreasonably jealous, resentful and angry that their partners  have loving memories of a dead person.  They feel that their partners *should* forget their deceased child, father, mother, sibling, friend wife or husband. \n\nWe also see plenty of posts about how, at the start of a relationship, one partner doesn't communicate something that really bothers them or that they dislike.    Such as the partner having a child from a previous relationship, a pet, that the person doesn't want kids or loves to go camping or keeps a stuffed animal on the dresser. Or that they remember a deceased person who was important to them.  Now that the honeymoon phase is over, they don't want the child around, hate the pet, is peeved that the partner still doesn't want kids, still enjoys camping or wants to keep the stuffed animal.  And hate that their partner still loves an important person from their past.  \n\nSo we can assume that the GF is justified in feeling neglected or, to be honest, it could well be unjustified.  We can only go by OP's words which sounds like an upstanding good guy.",

        "body": "There is nothing wrong with honoring people or visiting their graves long after their deaths. *Grief doesn't have an expiry date*. Most people do this on more 'traditional' dates like the anniversary of their death or their birthday. The only difference here is that you do it on a day that was special to you two and *only* you two. That by itself makes it difficult to understand for others why you choose that specific day to honor your friend.\n\nThe problem here is that it is your 'marriage date.' The marriage part may not necessarily mean anything. What *is* important is that this dat is the day that symbolises your friendship the most. The marriage part was just a silly joke and could have been any major/important thing between you two. However, your girlfriend does not see it that way and honestly, I can't blame her.\n\nI don't mean that I blame you either, to be clear. IMO this is a very big NAH. But you said yourself that you don't talk about your friend a lot to her, so I assume you also never truly explained the situation to your girlfriend. It's not weird to me that you visiting your friend every year on your marriage date may come off as threatening to her. I don't think it's weird that she, after seeing you honor you 'marriage' for four years, has grown to be sceptical about what you say it is vs. what you and your friend really felt for each other. I imagine it looks to her that you'd prefer to be with 'your ex girlfriend' rather than with her.\n\nI think it's important that you make it very clear to her what that day exactly meant to you and your friend. That it's the day that symbolises your friendship, what it meant and still means to you and most importantly, that it's not the marriage part that's important. That it could have been anything. That that was just a stupid joke. However that that 'event' *was the creation of a day to celebrate your friendship*. Because that is basically what every marriage is, serious or not. A day to remember and honor your love, or in your case your loving friendship.\n\nI hope this helps <3",

She is not a impulsive teen, she is a woman in her mid 20\u2019s for crying out loud.\n\nIt sounds like girlfriend has had enough of the relationship and ready to move on, that\u2019s all.\n\n*******\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not going to reply to every comment, I\u2019m sorry I WFH and get easily distracted, so I am adding it here. \n\nThe girlfriend going away for a week is most likely because she needs to get her head together and plan her next moves, before she talks to OP. She knows she said something nasty, and probably doesn\u2019t want to make that mistake again. So she is taking some time out to get her head together.\n\nFor those of you saying \u201cwell she can communicate like an adult\u201d -not everyone is good at communication. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s fucking hard for some people, especially when strong emotions are involved. Sometimes the best thing for people to do is take some time out and distance themselves from the emotional turmoil that they are feeling, so they can work out their own feelings.\n\nI stand by my comment that there is absolutely nothing in the OP to suggest that this woman would destroy the scrunchie, despite everyone\u2019s stories about how it\u2019s happened before. I don\u2019t care about whether some crazy person has done it before, there is no indication that the girlfriend is anything like that. In fact, she left the house for a week to stay with a friend -she is trying to prevent any further drama by keeping her distance.\n\nQuite frankly, I think people accusing her of wanting to destroy the scrunchie are projecting their own weird impulses onto this woman.",

Wouldn\u2019t she pop up occasionally in stories about OP\u2019s childhood? If OP is so militant about never mentioning her, that might ensure her presence in the relationship because she would be the elephant in the room that everyone knows about and never talks about. It might kind of be a situation like in du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca, where the first Mrs. Danvers\u2019 presence is very much felt even though she\u2019s not physically there and everyone does their best not to bring her up. We already know that OP\u2019s deceased friend is at least somewhat present in their lives because OP pictures of her that they recently gave to their parents. \n\nThat connects to another point that I noted. OP mentions that their therapist said something to them along the lines of not letting grief hold them hostage. Would a therapist say that if the relationship between OP and their dead friend was as healthy and normal as they say it is?\n\nAgain, none of this can be proven.

I certainly wouldn't feel like it was confusing if I was in a real marriage with someone, nor would I ever think to consider it \"competition.\" It's clearly just a cute silly high school story that now has deep meaning because of the circumstances. Why would that take away from a real romantic relationship? I also doubt that OP's friend was desperate to have a \"wedding\", I'm sure she simply wanted her friend to remember her and their friendship. \n\nI have a male best friend who passed away. We didn't have any traditions/stories like this, but I have had exes imply that I must have been romantically involved with him. It really pissed me off and I found it insulting that they would 1) imply that I am not capable of being friends with someone without banging them, and 2) assume that I would be dishonest about the nature of the relationship especially considering that he passed many years ago. And I absolutely do something to commemorate him every year on the anniversary of his passing, and anyone who doesn't like it can kick rocks. Sorry but being jealous of a deceased person is weird. \n\nNow I don't think OP should rush to break up with his gf or anything, obviously they need to talk, but I really don't think it's reasonable to feel that a  high school \"fake marriage\" is competition for your actual adult partnership. That points to serious insecurities.\n\n(Edited bc I forgot a word)",

Why would that take away from a real romantic relationship? I also doubt that OP&#39;s friend was desperate to have a &quot;wedding&quot;, I&#39;m sure she simply wanted her friend to remember her and their friendship. </p>\n\n<p>I have a male best friend who passed away. We didn&#39;t have any traditions/stories like this, but I have had exes imply that I must have been romantically involved with him. It really pissed me off and I found it insulting that they would 1) imply that I am not capable of being friends with someone without banging them, and 2) assume that I would be dishonest about the nature of the relationship especially considering that he passed many years ago. And I absolutely do something to commemorate him every year on the anniversary of his passing, and anyone who doesn&#39;t like it can kick rocks. Sorry but being jealous of a deceased person is weird. </p>\n\n<p>Now I don&#39;t think OP should rush to break up with his gf or anything, obviously they need to talk, but I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to feel that a  high school &quot;fake marriage&quot; is competition for your actual adult partnership. That points to serious insecurities.</p>\n\n<p>(Edited bc I forgot a word)</p>\n</div>",

OP\u2019s girlfriend is a self centered, self important individual who was faking her earlier acceptance of this ritual and is now showing her true colors (in which case you would think this behavior would bleed into other facets of the relationship and have been noticed by OP) and in which case OP should probably leave her. -OR-\n\n2.

My bf has living girl friends, I have living male friends we both engage with them when the opportunity says so, none of us have ANY problem with it because we aren't insecure and we trust eachother. MY girl friends tell me repeatedly how they wouldnt be okay with it. Well, glad it's not them in this relationship but me. Yes, I have been cheated on before in my life, twice even. But I don't place my insecurities on my present partner as I know people are all different and he's not the one to blame by what happened in the past. I'm talking about a 9 year relationship here btw. \n\nOP's gf is probably worried he has \"unresolved feelings\" from said friend back in the day, or thinks that the friend was \"the one\" and he knows it, she's just projecting her insecurities of feeling she might never be his One or she might never be at the level of the other girl. She's afraid of not being enough. That's what an insecure person with probably lack of self esteem would say/think. \n\nThis being said, when we are adults and in serious relationships is up to us to get our word across and make our partner understand how we actually feel, without hiding feelings, thoughts and so on. Communication is key. Of course the partner has to listen as well. And yes, sometimes fights happen, people \"explode\" and say unreasonable things, happens to all of us. But we have to turn it around after both have cooled down, sit down and speak like adults. This is a major existing problem in most adult relationships. People don't speak up, expect their partner to just know everything that crosses their minds and bootle up thoughts and feelings. \n\nAnd then \"Im gonna spend a week at a friends house\" happens. This kind of response are bottled up feelings 100%. There is no way just this one time thing when she was okay with it before would suddenly make her react like this.",

We always talked about marriage, he WANTED to be married, but actually planning something or thinking more than a few days ahead is NOT his forte. I finally just said, well if we&#39;re going to get married, maybe we should choose a date and tell people we&#39;re engaged. He said okay. That was probably around spring. We told family we were engaged and found a venue and date for the next summer.

I kept asking when, or what plans do we have. And it made me appear needy (our friends even told me that he felt pressured, we even broke up after he saw me emotional (happy tears) in our friends' engagement that we organized). I stopped asking and we finally broke it off (cheating, kid with another woman), he got married in just a few months to another girl he got pregnant. So it's very important to be HONESTLY on the same page with your partner, I felt like I was just waiting for him to grow up and be ready while he was just waiting for the right girl which obviously wasnt me.

All our friends were getting married and we were already on our 6th year, we always talk that we&#39;ll get married eventually. I kept asking when, or what plans do we have. And it made me appear needy (our friends even told me that he felt pressured, we even broke up after he saw me emotional (happy tears) in our friends&#39; engagement that we organized). I stopped asking and we finally broke it off (cheating, kid with another woman), he got married in just a few months to another girl he got pregnant. So it&#39;s very important to be HONESTLY on the same page with your partner, I felt like I was just waiting for him to grow up and be ready while he was just waiting for the right girl which obviously wasnt me. Could have saved me my best years.</p>\n</div>",
