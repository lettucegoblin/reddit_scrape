And you sucked for selling the car. \n\nI understand you had a \u201ccontract\u201d. I understand you\u2019re trying to teach her a lesson. She SHOULD be taught a lesson. But selling the car? A bit overboard in my opinion. You could\u2019ve took the keys from her and withheld her driving privileges for a month or two. Hell, you could\u2019ve taken her cell phone for a month as well. I bet that would\u2019ve livened her ass up. But now you sold the car which was gonna be her primary means of transport in the future + college like she said. Idk if you and your family just got money to blow or what, but I guess you don\u2019t mind being out thousands of dollars to prove a point. If it were me, I\u2019d have took the car and phone for a month or so. NOW, you have to buy her ANOTHER car down the road (let\u2019s be real, she\u2019s gonna need a car, and at some point you\u2019re all gonna move past this, she\u2019ll have learned her lesson, and you\u2019ll be buying another car) Bc you sold the one you already bought to make a point. \n\nAnd let\u2019s get something straight before people start downvoting and saying how bad texting and driving is - no shit. I agree. Texting and driving is bad. Common sense. But I\u2019d bet my damn life we\u2019ve all done it before at least once or twice. Some people probably do it all the time but you\u2019re still gonna say NTA. OP has probably texted and drove/drives. I understand the point you\u2019re trying to make to your daughter, but to sell the car over it is just a bit over the top in my opinion. Yes, she shouldn\u2019t be texting and driving. Should she be taught a lesson? Yes. I just feel like there are better ways OP could\u2019ve went about it than selling the car. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say.\n\nEdit: and just like I predicted - people are saying I\u2019m DEFENDING texting and driving and making an excuse for it. I never DEFENDED it. Ever. I\u2019m just pointing out that most people HAVE texted and drove before. Don\u2019t try to sit here and act all high and mighty and tell me you\u2019ve never even LOOKED at your phone while driving. You\u2019d be lying to yourself and to everyone here to try to make yourself seem better than others. My POINT that I\u2019m making, is I AGREE that the daughter should be taught a lesson, but it could\u2019ve been done in a better way, and that selling the car was just a bit over the top. OBVIOUSLY the daughter is wrong for texting and driving. But, taking the phone, taking the car, and having a long simple talk about it would\u2019ve also worked instead of selling the car.\n\nI\u2019m also not saying the parents HAVE to buy her another car, like they\u2019re obligated to do so. What I\u2019m saying is OP will INEVITABLY buy her another one. Judging by the fact he seems to fine with losing a few thousands dollars to prove a point, something tells they also don\u2019t mind buying another vehicle down the road after the daughter has learned her lesson and understand road safety better. I\u2019m not saying OP HAS to. But most parents who can do that, and have the financial means to do that kind of that kind of thing for their kid, will do it.",

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nWhen my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a \"contract\" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. \n\nWe made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.\n\nWife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the \"how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?\" card and I said \"Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?\" and she just up and screamed. \n\nThis has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. \n\nThe car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They&#39;ve threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. </p>\n\n<p>The car is already sold, so there&#39;s no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. </p>\n\n<p>So AITA?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My dad was hit and had his back broken by a distracted driver just like OP's daughter. My friend's twin sister died because she was distracted and ran through a stop light. This is real and it can happen to her.   \n\n\nWhen you engage in an activity this dangerous, you deserve a one strike only policy. OP's daughter knew the rules, and was so bad at driving many others not only noticed but documented her.  She broke the contract she had with her parents. In the \"real world\" you don't get second chances. You do a major fuck up at work that endangers others, they aren't going to give you a chance to learn... your ass will be fired. If a cop catches her distracted driving, he's not going to give her a second chance either. She's lucky she's  getting punished by her parents, and not through the law, or in the ICU through an injury she caused.  \n\n\nI would say this shouldn't be the only thing she should experience. The girl should go through training and get educated with the consequences of distracted driving. Watch some videos of people getting killed who were doing the same things she was doing.   \n\n\nShe demonstrated through her own immature behavior that she doesn't grasp the seriousness of her behavior, therefor she doesn't deserve the privilege of driving a car... and it is a privilege, not a right.  Millions of college students get on just fine without a car. And sure... OP and his wife can't stop her from engaging in risky behavior when she comes of age. She could start doing meth and become someone truly unfortunate, but as long as she's a minor the parents get a say in what she has access to. Maybe she will figure shit out and become mature enough by 18 to handle having a car again...  \n\n\nIMO letting her drive after such a serious infraction won't teach her shit. I don't think you should get to put people's lives at risk and expect the rules to be lenient.",

I want her to learn that lesson with a consequence that will only cause her inconvenience, rather than risk her learning it by having someone\u2019s death on her conscience, and having 10-20 years in prison to think about it. I can\u2019t keep you from buying her a car, but know that if you do, she will continue playing with her phone while she\u2019s driving, and you risk her killing someone\u2014or herself. Know that if you do, you won\u2019t earn yourself brownie points with her, she will only get from this that we\u2019re vindictive people to resent, and that she was right to do what she did.

I want her to learn that lesson with a consequence that will only cause her inconvenience, rather than risk her learning it by having someone\u2019s death on her conscience, and having 10-20 years in prison to think about it. I can\u2019t keep you from buying her a car, but know that if you do, she will continue playing with her phone while she\u2019s driving, and you risk her killing someone\u2014or herself. Know that if you do, you won\u2019t earn yourself brownie points with her, she will only get from this that we\u2019re vindictive people to resent, and that she was right to do what she did. And if you choose to risk your granddaughter\u2019s life, and damage our relationship with our daughter, MY relationship with <em>you</em> will not be the same. So before you get all puffed up with indignation at MY parenting MY daughter how I see fit, think about what repercussions your actions will have on the entire family.\u201d</p>\n</div>",
