We both work on the ups of 50 hours a week. I am shift manager at a behavioral disorders facility. Both jobs are very hands on and strenuous. \n\nSince his promotion he has developed an entirely different attitude. Extremely entitled and dare I say rude as all fuck. He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. \n\nSo, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after \"working so hard\". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say \"wheres mine?\" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say \"I worked all day\" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he \"makes more\". \n\nLast night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says \"babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!\" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said \"Did you hear me?\" \n\nSo I responded with \"Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself.\" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said \"But I worked all fucking day!\" So I snapped back with \"Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself.\" \n\nHe is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. \n\nAITA? Did I push it too far?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your husband is still the same person and still has the same responsibilities at home.  Has he thought that he&#39;s making you feel unappreciated?</p>\n\n<p>So did you push it too far?  No, I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t snap sooner.  Not to belittle his work, because everyone&#39;s work is important - especially in these trying times - but he&#39;s not saving lives and he&#39;s not running a country.  He needs to get a grip and have some humility.</p>\n</div>",

Are you guys not in an equal partnership? \n\nThat shit would be a deal breaker for me. I\u2019m the only income in our house and my SO of ten years is the SAHD. I work outside of the home and guess what? Never have I come home and demanded those things. I\u2019m tired as all hell when I get home from a 10-14 hour day but I\u2019m still so happy to see my kids when I get home or have an off day. I don\u2019t make my SO do everything in the home. We are PARTNERS and split things evenly. Some weeks he takes on even more than normal because I\u2019m working 60 hours. I always make sure he has cash and a debit card in case him and the kids want to do something or if an emergency arises. We budget together, we cook and clean together and I was just promoted to MANAGER, not assistant. If your DUH acts like this at home I really hope he doesn\u2019t act like it at work or he will be looking for a new job or at a demotion soon. Nip this now and keep knocking him off that high horse or divorce may be in the future because that shit is unacceptable. Good luck hon.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. </p>\n\n<p>I would sit him down and tell him that he\u2019s been insufferable since he got this promotion. He didn\u2019t get promoted at home and he needs to leave his entitled bullshit at the door the second he gets home. That his nightly demands for back rubs, complete silence from a four years old, his favorite meals being prepared and in the table when he gets home and the constant trying to make you do everything for him is to stop now. It\u2019s ridiculous and it\u2019s been going on for weeks. You also need to tell him that NO. He doesn\u2019t control the money because he \u201cmakes more\u201d.

I\u2019d tell him to get his head out of his ass, this isn\u2019t 1940 where he gets to work 40 hours a week and come to a clean quiet house with dinner and a blow job. This is 2020 and men need to spend time with their children, cook dinner, clean the house, AND make an effort to be attentive husbands. He\u2019s being lazy and entitled and I wouldn\u2019t stand for it either. </p>\n\n<p>My husband can get like this at times, he makes a shit ton of money with minimal effort but I work my ass off and don\u2019t make shit in comparison, he thinks I should be the one doing everything around the house simply because I don\u2019t make as much, he\u2019s sadly mistaken, lol.</p>\n</div>",

A good chunk of the jobs in the US that require working over 40 hours usually aren't paying employees very well, hence why they sign up for jobs that offer overtime pay or incentives. Obviously you get jobs in the health industry that require someone to be there at all times; if someone doesn't show up you can't leave. But, you go into that field knowing that can be an option. \n\nI think a huge kicker is salary. I was salaried as an activity director at a 100 bed ICFIID, and would see nothing added to my check for a 60 hour week, but if I clocked out 15 min early they would take that out of my pay. Thats not how salary works but thats how many companies treat it, and those companies aren't really known for giving enough time off to go to other job interviews. You can't quit witbout a backup because you need the money or the insurance, so you get stuck in a cycle. It's terrible.",

So people put in extra hours as a way of gaining favor. There are also very limited social safety nets, so most people in US are walking around with a significant amount of fear mixed with scarcity as a normal emotion for a worker. This makes most people unwilling to risk their job by advocating for better conditions.\n\nThe US is so big and so populous, we know that most employers can replace us with no issue within a week. Politicians are also invested in making sure unions have no power even if they are allowed to form.\n\nETA: Most of us aren't okay and would love to work towards a different labor model, but the stakes escalate pretty quickly to life or death scenarios when it comes to losing healthcare or violent/dismissive reactions to a strike. I don't fault anyone for not wanting to die impoverished and disabled while other workers roll their eyes and say it's your own fault for stirring up trouble.",
