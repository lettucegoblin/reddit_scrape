The way I see it is like this:\n\nRick, whilst a victim to a secret kept from him, has literally no right to OP\u2019s property and was being an asshole. OP isn\u2019t being petty, he\u2019s being asked to completely leave his home, open to strangers, unprotected, for an entire weekend where an event will be held, and is told he literally won\u2019t be welcomed at his own home in any capacity. \n\nIf Rick is so uncomfortable with the idea of OP being at the wedding, then it\u2019s extremely strange Rick isn\u2019t super uncomfortable with the venue of the wedding being at OPs property. If he\u2019s uncomfortable with OP attending the wedding then why isn\u2019t Rick uncomfortable with the wedding being held on OP\u2019s land? When OP doesn\u2019t owe him anything, \u201cthe least he can do\u201d is absolute bullshit to try and make OP feel guilty about a secret that wasn\u2019t his to tell, where Rick is now getting his friends and family to harass OP, who would literally be barred from his own property for an entire weekend and unable to protect his home, to give up his home because it somehow suits Rick? Rick\u2019s being an asshole, no matter how you paint this. Rick\u2019s family and friends are also being assholes.\n\nThe best solution would be, if OP agreed to them still using his property, is to have OP stay in his house but not attend the ceremony or evening reception. That way OP can help if he\u2019s needed, and is able to keep an eye on his home and property. That\u2019s if OP even agrees, because it\u2019s his property and he has the right to say \u201cno\u201d at any point. And tbh if I was in this situation, I wouldn\u2019t let them use my property even if they were \u201cgracious enough\u201d to let them stay in my own home during the whole wedding, you\u2019d feel like a prisoner trapped in your house, in rooms away from the wedding party, essentially having to hide in your own home. It would be an utterly shit situation.\n\nNobody is respecting OP here, they just want to use his property when it suits them but don\u2019t actually respect him as a person. So OP isn\u2019t the asshole in this situation. Rick and Rick\u2019s friends and family, however, are being entitled wee shites.\n\nYour \u201cfriends\u201d blaming you for everything ain\u2019t your friends, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re blaming you for Rick\u2019s behaviour. Rick showed his true colours and clearly comes from an entitled, toxic family who think they can bully you into submission where you\u2019ll eventually give in and let them do whatever they want. I don\u2019t understand how your \u201cfriends\u201d can support that at all.\n\nAlso good for Carla, she dodged a bullet. Rick showed her his true colours and she noped right out of there. It\u2019s a shame it took a situation like this for him to reveal himself, but at least it was before the wedding, making it easier for her to call it quits.\n\nI\u2019m glad you stood your ground, OP. This entire thing was stupid. Rick was beyond entitled, thought you \u201cowed\u201d him your literal property, asked you to leave because the idea of you being there made him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d but was somehow completely okay using your property, couldn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer, gave out your private phone number to friends and family to harass you, and harassed you so much that you almost got the police involved.

        "body": "No, I never told her.  She is married to a wonderful guy who is great for her.  They've been together over 12 years now.  I could tell from the first time she introduced us that he was going to marry her and that they were a perfect fit.  It's hard to describe, but they just...fit.  Similar sense of humor, same taste in music, complementary personalities in pretty much every way.  I don't consider him a friend of mine per se, as I usually still hang out with my friend alone, but we get along well when he does tag along.  I wholeheartedly endorse their relationship and was maid of honor in her wedding.  \n\nI had a zero percent chance of dating her anyway as she is a straight woman and I'm AFAB nonbinary, so telling her would have made things weird for absolutely no reason at all.  I confided in one person about the issue (who knew only me, not my friend) and she basically asked me whether it was something I thought I could get over or if I was going to ruin my friendship over it.  I thought about it and decided having her in my life was more important to me than confessing my feelings, so I distanced myself a little for a while, processed my feelings, and got over it.  She's still one of my best friends today.  I will talk about it anonymously on the internet, but otherwise, I plan to take the secret to my grave.  No need to be honest if (1) it's not an issue anymore and (2) all it would do is potentially create drama where there isn't any.\n\nI still love my friend very much, but in a strictly platonic way.  There are zero lingering romantic feelings at all, and these days I think of her more like a cousin or sister than anything else.  It would never cross my mind to try to do anything that would undermine or harm her relationship with her husband.\n\nI'm single and looking, so no, I haven't found my person.  I stopped dating for a while (well, for several years) after a really negative experience I had with a woman who was apparently dealing with serious undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues.  I decided I wanted to focus on myself and work on the things I wanted to build for myself rather than continue to date.  I was just starting to put myself out there again when the world shut down unexpectedly last year.  I am immunocompromised so I'm taking it pretty slow in getting back out there and I'm also trying to work on increasing my mobility and losing some of the weight I gained during the pandemic.  So hopefully next year I'll be ready to start dating again.\n\nSorry for writing a novel in response to your questions!  I appreciate your kindness towards me even though it sounds based on your experiences that you have good reason to be skeptical of me.  Thanks for listening and I am really sorry things didn't work out in your situation.  Would be happy to listen to you as well if you wanted to share, but if not, I completely understand.  Sending good vibes your way.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>No, I never told her.  She is married to a wonderful guy who is great for her.  They&#39;ve been together over 12 years now.  I could tell from the first time she introduced us that he was going to marry her and that they were a perfect fit.  It&#39;s hard to describe, but they just...fit.  Similar sense of humor, same taste in music, complementary personalities in pretty much every way.  I don&#39;t consider him a friend of mine per se, as I usually still hang out with my friend alone, but we get along well when he does tag along.  I wholeheartedly endorse their relationship and was maid of honor in her wedding.  </p>\n\n<p>I had a zero percent chance of dating her anyway as she is a straight woman and I&#39;m AFAB nonbinary, so telling her would have made things weird for absolutely no reason at all.

Like...to keep bringing up \"oh, I used to date X\" is more weird because at this point she should think of him as purely a friend, not an ex. He's married and she's getting married, so why dredge up the past? Idk, my history is usually on my sleeve, I just don't like the idea that a partner HAS to tell someone every person they've been with. But in this case, yeah ok, that makes sense, especially since I guess she said she had feelings for OP later. Why people get married when they aren't 1000000% sure is beyond me smh.",
