Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThat\u2019s the actual quote. I\u2019m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here. \n\nMy brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn\u2019t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. \n\nOur wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. \n\nMy wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. \n\nAnyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny. \n\nMy brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes.

I\u2019m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here. </p>\n\n<p>My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn\u2019t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. </p>\n\n<p>Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. </p>\n\n<p>My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny. </p>\n\n<p>My brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn\u2019t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing. </p>\n\n<p>He\u2019s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he\u2019s probably well intentioned. </p>\n\n<p>I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven\u2019t asked my wife why she\u2019s recently starting wearing more makeup and I\u2019m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. </p>\n\n<p>She\u2019s spending her money on stuff for her face and it\u2019s a creative hobby.

Also I wanted to add that getting the good makeup can be super pigmented which means you need to use less, VERY expensive, there can be a lot more in the pan then people realize, and it does have an expiration date (often 6 months to a year after opening) so it makes sense that she's using it before it has to be thrown away.  My adult daughter works in a restaurant and has gotten super into nail art since the pandemic started; that doesn't mean she's doing anything new or special with her hands, just that she's enjoying a creative hobby.

We love buying new stuff and sharing nice stuff we find with each other. Hell my daughter is 10yo and she likes to play dress up with me. She has such a steady hand and can do such a crisp lipstick! Its not to impress any man. Hell some days I don't even do my face I just have fun doing swatches on my arm. And especially with covid and lock down just the act of getting dressed and made up is so good for your mental health.\n\nYou sound like an amazing supportive husband and deserve all the blow jobs. You are not the asshole. Your brother is having his own issues and is projecting. Good for you for sticking up for your wife.",

It doesn&#39;t even matter if you get a takeout delivery, just have some time when the lights are low, the music is smooth and suitable for a slow dance around the living room and she gets to feel like a beautiful woman you know she is rather than just a mum who is stuck inside all day.</p>\n</div>",

But i wasn\u2019t being 100% fair there either as she usually has very stressful days with my brother and I (especially with my adhd) so i won\u2019t get too mad at her for saying whatever she wants when I\u2019m not putting an effort. but it still hurts. also side note: a few things. i\u2019m rwlly tired rn so if the grammar is just shit please look past that. i also may have left out context in some parts too. also since this is am i the asshole. just wanna know. am i the asshole for giving my mom a rough time with my adhd even though i cant control it but i dont put an effort then so i have no right to feel bad about the name calling or what? may or may not be up still to reply if you respond. will check out those subs. am getting counseling for my anxiety too so at my next appointment i will ask for some therapy as well if possible. i feel like my mom genuinely cares about me it\u2019s just she says things that i don\u2019t like and it hurts but it\u2019s when she\u2019s already stressed and part of why she\u2019s stressed is because of me so idk. huge clusterfuck. thanks so much for the recommendations.",

But i wasn\u2019t being 100% fair there either as she usually has very stressful days with my brother and I (especially with my adhd) so i won\u2019t get too mad at her for saying whatever she wants when I\u2019m not putting an effort. but it still hurts. also side note: a few things. i\u2019m rwlly tired rn so if the grammar is just shit please look past that. i also may have left out context in some parts too. also since this is am i the asshole. just wanna know. am i the asshole for giving my mom a rough time with my adhd even though i cant control it but i dont put an effort then so i have no right to feel bad about the name calling or what? may or may not be up still to reply if you respond. will check out those subs. am getting counseling for my anxiety too so at my next appointment i will ask for some therapy as well if possible. i feel like my mom genuinely cares about me it\u2019s just she says things that i don\u2019t like and it hurts but it\u2019s when she\u2019s already stressed and part of why she\u2019s stressed is because of me so idk. huge clusterfuck. thanks so much for the recommendations.</p>\n</div>",

The starter set comes with a liquid liner.\n\nI struggle with liquid liners and have hooded eyes so I'm not a fan of their liner.\n\nArdells lashes aren't as good imo. Only 3 magnets and the lash line is thick and stiff and harder to get a good stick.
