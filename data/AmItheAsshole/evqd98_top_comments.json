Who knows how he\u2019ll feel about me posting those pictures of him once he grows up. I still take lots of pics, but they are for me and immediate family only. \n\nYour mom is probably having a hard time for several reasons:\n1) This is who she has been for so long, and she probably never thought of you or your sister as individuals but as commodities she could use to advance her online image. I\u2019m not saying that to be mean, but she probably never put the thought into it that I did even before my son was born. \n2) You are a teenager and that is hard for parents to deal with on its own. Add to that the previous point and your mom probably feels adrift not knowing what happened to her little baby who used to smile at funny faces. Not condoning what she\u2019s done, but trying to help you understand where she might be coming from. \n3) You\u2019ve roped your sister into it, so now she is getting it from both sides. She can\u2019t use either one of you, and she is feeling attacked for a parenting choice she has made for years. \n\nWhat I would do going forward is keep your emotions calm and collected. Teens are volatile, so don\u2019t let her use that as an excuse for your behavior. But stand your ground. This is your image, your life. You get to decide how you want that to be, even if you aren\u2019t an adult yet.",

Before I only posted pictures of him where you couldn\u2019t see his face, but I felt like even that was too much. Who knows how he\u2019ll feel about me posting those pictures of him once he grows up. I still take lots of pics, but they are for me and immediate family only. </p>\n\n<p>Your mom is probably having a hard time for several reasons:\n1) This is who she has been for so long, and she probably never thought of you or your sister as individuals but as commodities she could use to advance her online image. I\u2019m not saying that to be mean, but she probably never put the thought into it that I did even before my son was born. \n2) You are a teenager and that is hard for parents to deal with on its own. Add to that the previous point and your mom probably feels adrift not knowing what happened to her little baby who used to smile at funny faces. Not condoning what she\u2019s done, but trying to help you understand where she might be coming from. \n3) You\u2019ve roped your sister into it, so now she is getting it from both sides. She can\u2019t use either one of you, and she is feeling attacked for a parenting choice she has made for years. </p>\n\n<p>What I would do going forward is keep your emotions calm and collected. Teens are volatile, so don\u2019t let her use that as an excuse for your behavior. But stand your ground. This is your image, your life. You get to decide how you want that to be, even if you aren\u2019t an adult yet.</p>\n</div>",

Mom has made a lot of money selling the image of &quot;family&quot; without the permission of some of the people in that family. It is not OP&#39;s responsibility to figure out or make it easier or facilitate Mom&#39;s blog or how to support the family. OP made OP&#39;s wishes known, and was kind and generous enough to buy Sis a hoodie too. No one should have a problem with someone saying no to a photo, unless it&#39;s for identification. I dont post any photos of my husband online, because he doesn&#39;t like photos. I rarely post photos of me online, because I don&#39;t like them.</p>\n</div>",

I was bullied a lot throughout my preteen and teen years, and whatever bullies and backstabbing friends can get their hands on, they will absolutely use against the victim. The internet is an invaluable tool for bullies, unfortunately. I\u2019m not a parent myself and don\u2019t think I ever want to be, but if I did, I would definitely see protecting my child\u2019s privacy as paramount. It\u2019s an extension of protecting their safety, which is already a parental responsibility. Plus, it\u2019s just basic kindness/courtesy. I\u2019m glad that more parents seem to be kinda leveling with their kids...like, making an effort to empathize and listen. Like adults, kids have their reasons for feeling or acting a certain way, even if they\u2019re sometimes irrational/illogical. On the flip side, just like adults...compromise isn\u2019t always possible nor practical/wanted, lol.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You\u2019re so right about feeding bullies/frenemies. I was bullied a lot throughout my preteen and teen years, and whatever bullies and backstabbing friends can get their hands on, they will absolutely use against the victim. The internet is an invaluable tool for bullies, unfortunately. I\u2019m not a parent myself and don\u2019t think I ever want to be, but if I did, I would definitely see protecting my child\u2019s privacy as paramount. It\u2019s an extension of protecting their safety, which is already a parental responsibility. Plus, it\u2019s just basic kindness/courtesy. I\u2019m glad that more parents seem to be kinda leveling with their kids...like, making an effort to empathize and listen.
