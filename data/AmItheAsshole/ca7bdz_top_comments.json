        "body": "Man I don't wanna say YTA, but you are.  I knew it as soon as you said, \"I'm only hurting myself\".\n\nYears ago, I had decided to let myself go into my addiction because \"I was only hurting myself\".  It made sense at the time.  I only drank at night, at home, alone, and always made sure I had everything I needed for the night so that I would have no excuse to drive.\n\nI constantly told myself that outside of the drinking, my life was tolerable, but it was anything but normal.  My life was falling apart and I excused away all the signs.\n\nWhen I got a knock on my door one day, while I was sleeping off a hangover at noon on a work day. I work an office job, and had just decided not to go in... Again.\n\nThere was a police officer at my door, and my dog was losing his mind, so I said fuck it and opened the door in my boxers and t-shirt and bed head / bed beard.\n\nHe asked if I was Jason. I said yes, obviously annoyed.  He said, \"Your mother called us from Georgia and asked us to check on you, to make sure you were alive.\" My mother lives more than 1000 miles away.  To this day I'm not 100% certain what precipitated the call, but that's because I always convinced myself that everything was fine.\n\n I did come to find out that all of my siblings (also in Georgia) had been telling her she needed to say something to me.  Everybody was concerned and angry, and I don't know how they knew what I was doing to myself across the country, but they KNEW.\n\nI was hurting myself a lot, and I was hurting everyone who cared about me as they watched me tear my life apart.  You may not be tearing your \"life\" apart, but you are destroying your body, and they can see that, and it hurts them immensely.  \n\nFurthermore, you have the classic signs of addiction.  You know it's not okay to eat the majority of the food before the party is even halfway over, but you found ways to excuse the behavior.  You came here because you kind of thought your (very poor) excuses were valid.  You got mad at commenters and tried to defend your excuses.  You didn't say, \"yep I really am an asshole for my behavior and really have a problem\".  You don't see it from their side, because it would not be comfortable to see.\n\nYour addiction works on your mind. It gives you thoughts. Thoughts that work against your best interest.  They're very, very, very convincing thoughts.  The worst part is your own mind is working against you, and you'd have to use your own mind to fight back.  It doesn't work very well, since the mind (or at least thoughts) are the problem.\n\nYour addiction also gives you amazing defense mechanisms to avoid being found out.  You don't see their side because your defense mechanism is to deflect blame and find a problem with the person shaming you.  You justify your behavior with very well woven justifications, not to convince others (because they're obviously not valid from the outside) but to convince yourself.  To keep from hating yourself for the bad behavior your addiction causes.  \n\nThe justifications are for you.  They're to help you keep your sanity and continue to feed the addiction. Other people are never going to fall for them. Or at least not fall for them very often.\n\nThat behavior of justifying IS NOT NORMAL.  Most people do not invent a fantasy of counterarguments to sustain their way of life.  THAT is why your sisters are mad.  Because it's obvious that you have made such mental gymnastics to excuse your behavior, and they are so tired and frustrated with how unwilling you are to see your behavior for what it is.\n\nSorry, I went on a tangent, but it was to prove a point.  There is no addiction that will only hurt the addict.  The addict needs to believe it does, because it allows the addict to feed the addiction without guilt.  Addiction harms everybody who cares about you. Everybody who respects you. Everybody who likes having you around.  You need to take down the blinders and look at your situation for what it really is.  That will be terrifying because your addiction will fight back hard, it will kick and scream and thrash out, but it is necessary.\n\nGood luck to you.",

It's a set of fights with the main advertised fight at the end of the night (Usually around 10:30/11) people like to eat in-between that. It probably frustrated and panicked the hostess because she can't just order another one, these things have to be pre ordered which probably frustrated and panicked the hostess. Not only that but the time it takes for pizza or another sub-par (pun intended) sub may have crossed over into the next fight. Not to mention 6 foot subs run around $100 dollars. That could also mean that the hostess can't afford to replace it and even if you did offer to pay, that's embarrassing to the hosts.\n\nAdditionally, your friends are probably frustrated because that sub was probably freaking delicious and people wanted more. They didn't want pizza, they didn't want Subway, they wanted that specialty sub. And a 6 foot sub should have lasted atleast to the halfway point in that situation. It's crazy that it didn't and I wonder if this may have happened before???\n\nLastly, and the big red flag here is that you ate nearly 4 feet of a sub. You admit you called out for a last call but don't think anyone heard you yet used that as your excuse to eat it anyways. In your original post you tried to minimize and justify your actions and people still saw through this and are calling you out for it.

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nWhat I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you&#39;re a little hefty or a body builder type with a larger than normal appetite- bring a larger than normal amount of food. Also, never be the person to kill off an item at a potluck. But if you eat four feet of sub you have a serious problem that will kill you.</p>\n\n<p>Dropping dead of a heart attack at 40 doesn&#39;t just hurt OP. Hurts his friends and family, too. Like his family doesn&#39;t watch him hurt himself and worry?</p>\n</div>",

I don't want to judge people so quickly just by reading a post, but OP, if you're not suffering from a food addiction, you're very likely heading in that direction. It robs you of everything you enjoy and replaces all of your thoughts with food as your only source of happiness. Eventually, you start to isolate yourself from everyone, drop every hobby, because nothing and no one brings you any joy anymore, only food. And it indeed does affect everyone close to you - the friends you end up ghosting, your family who is worried about you. It's just that the addiction will be stronger than your love for them.\n\n\nSorry for rambling, but to OP, please please get help before it's too late. I know it doesn't seem that way to you, I know it's difficult, and even embarassing at times because of the stigmatization of people with BED/food addiction, but this can get very serious and turn your life into pure misery.

        "body": "> That's stomach tearing amounts of food\n\nSo much this! People like to say how \"starving\" they were, which is why they ate so much. But you get hungry when your stomach is empty and when it stretches again the hunger signals stop (due to the hormone ghrelin). This is why it's recommended that you wait 15-20 minutes before getting seconds to figure out if you're really still hungry or just want to eat more because of the taste. It's also why you're told to eat slower or drink a glass of water before a meal, so your stomach has time to recognize that it's stretched and ghrelin stops being secreted. \n\nThis reminds me of the other AITA post about the guy who ate the extra steak over the sides (potatoes and salad) because only the steak would \"satisfy\" him. No, it would satisfy his *mouth* more, not his stomach. Your stomach can't count calories, only how full it is.\n\nPoor eating habits (like under- and over-eating) can influence your hormones and what your body expects. Maybe OP really was feeling hungry after the first 18 inches because his body is used to a certain \"fullness\" meaning he stops eating (even though I'm guessing it was more than enough calories) or maybe OP just really liked the taste of the sub and wanted more because he didn't want the experience to end. I get it, I've been there and it's a really difficult thing to come to terms with but I honestly think it's one of the most important things to learn when it comes to being healthy. Eat that extra piece of cake or second serving if you really want to, it's not that big of a deal to give into cravings every so often, but just recognize that you aren't doing it because your body needs it but because you *want* it.",

That&#39;s so disrespectful and disgusting. </p>\n\n<p>OP, your share of 8-12 tiny wings does not equal to over half of the sub. You need to learn to share. I don&#39;t know what you were thinking.</p>\n</div>",

They're almost always designed to be cut up and served in smaller portions than a typical six-inch, so there's a very good chance that the OP ate a lot more than even just three single-serve foot-longs.

It was a complete accident, I ran straight to the store two blocks away, and bought another one, but the simple fact that I let myself get to the point where I did it was enough to make my aunt really unhappy with me.
