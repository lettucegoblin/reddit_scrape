And think the Bahamas are exotic because of the climate and foliage? That&#39;s why I consider them exotic, at least. I&#39;m on the border with Canada, so the climate and foliage would be WAY different for me, I doubt the Bahamas have fields of pine trees, about as many Grey Squirrels as you can imagine and snow for half the year. Belgium is at about the same latitude as the northern United States, so I have to imagine that if she&#39;s living there the climate isn&#39;t that dissimilar to the climate in Belgium. Given that, if she lives in the northern U.S., I imagine that the climate in the Bahamas would feel considerable more exotic compared to Belgium than where she&#39;s living now.</p>\n</div>",

I was a newbie and were already doing more than the allowed speed for that maneuver, he came up with cca 1.5 of the speed allowed. Fun thing is, he turned like a mile later... the 1.5 mile turning lane was completely empty..",

Grammar borrows from both French and German, with a side of some other languages. We&#39;re forgiving of incorrect tones (I mean, Creek can be pronounced &#39;crik&#39;.....) Even if you put the accent on the wrong syllable we can usually understand. There&#39;s so many words that if you choose one that&#39;s even kinda related, it will usually make sense. (A friend speaking to a doctor in a foreign country found out she had a fungal infection when she was told she had &quot;mushrooms.&quot; ) And if that&#39;s not enough, English often appears in print next to other languages, meaning it&#39;s not hard to start picking up a vocabulary from stores and ads.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking English well is difficult, I&#39;d grant that to anyone, but acquiring BAD English seems to be cake.</p>\n</div>",
