Because he acts like I\u2019m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he\u2019s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors.

AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. \nI said the first thing which came to my head, which was: \u201cIf you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.\u201d\nBruh. If looks could kill, I\u2019d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn\u2019t say anything else. She hasn\u2019t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don\u2019t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won\u2019t bring it up anymore. \nI feel like we\u2019re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don\u2019t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel.

Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that\u2019s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. \nI said the first thing which came to my head, which was: \u201cIf you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.\u201d\nBruh. If looks could kill, I\u2019d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn\u2019t say anything else. She hasn\u2019t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don\u2019t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won\u2019t bring it up anymore. \nI feel like we\u2019re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don\u2019t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
