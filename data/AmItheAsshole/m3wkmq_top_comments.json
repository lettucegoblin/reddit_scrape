I won\u2019t give too many details but he\u2019s well known in the academic circles of our country and attends an institute of higher education. Naturally people are impressed with his intelligence and he\u2019s quite popular and makes friends easily. Our parents dote on him and have never told him \u201cno\u201d. As a result he has become very arrogant, condescending and disrespectful to people he deems below him...that\u2019s just about everyone.  \n\nLately he\u2019s been openly talking about a girl he\u2019s crushing on and much to his dismay she\u2019s quite unimpressed with him. He often complains to my parents and I about his failed attempts to befriend her. \n\nI understand why she dislikes him. On one occasion he invited her over for a school project and I overheard their interaction. He was constantly talking over her, dismissing her ideas and even calling them stupid. 99% of the time he was talking about himself and his accomplishments, being in news articles, his future plans are etc. The poor girl obviously seemed uncomfortable. He quizzed her about her career aspirations and when she answered he proceeded to point out it\u2019s a bad career path. \n\nToday he was once again complaining about her and said that she\u2019s obviously intimidated by his superior intellect. He claimed that all girls only like \u201cstupid guys\u201d and that \u201cwomen are emotional\u201d.  Sadly my parents agreed and kept assuring him that this girl is obviously uncomfortable with the fact he\u2019s so accomplished and awesome.  \n\n\nAfter hearing this nonsense many times, I finally told him that his crush dislikes him because he behaves like an obnoxious, know-it-all asshole. \nI explained that he\u2019d probably have a chance if he showed some modesty instead of talking down on this girl so much. \n\nSo my parents obviously think I\u2019m an asshole for saying this. They said that it was horrible of me to say this to a 13 year old and that he\u2019s just a child. I told them that he needs to realise that his personality is becoming a problem and that his crush dislikes him because he\u2019s an AH, not because he\u2019s \u201ctoo smart\u201d.

She struggled to make friends because kids thought she was talking down to them. In 1st grade she was reading on a 12th grade level. Her vocabulary is extensive and she used big words. Kids and adults thought she came across condescending.  (Because she did) It been a difficult road teaching her how to talk and interact. She is now an adult, has plenty of friends and is successful but she still calls me for advice. </p>\n\n<p>My advice - Apologize to your brother and take a loving, helpful approach before you create a wall between yourself, him and your parents that is difficult to mend.</p>\n</div>",

He isn't responding with \"you're just jealous\" or \"no, you're wrong and here's why\"; he's actually confused and when people are confused, they think. This might be the wake-up call he needed to realize that just because he's smart doesn't mean he's made to thrive. Obviously, he sounds like he'll be financially successful with a good career, but at what cost to him? I doubt he actually wants to live a life of success without any real connection to people, but that's the route he's going down because he wasn't taught the social skills needed for them.

        "body": "A story, if I may?\n\nGrowing up, I knew someone like your brother.  My parents were immigrants and they were part of a social group of people living in our community who were also from their respective countries because there weren't many of us.   One of the parents in this group had a son that had skipped several grades, graduated early, and was heading to college at 15, also a prestigious university.\n\nSame thing with the parents - convinced their son crapped gold because of his intellect and achievements thus far and partly, because well the culture my parents were from generally treat sons like they are perfect angels incapable of sin.  It was a bad combo.  And like your brother, he had no emotional intelligence and really poor social skills because if you didn't treat him as your superior, he would treat you as his inferior.  \n\nHe went to undergrad.   But he had a pretty miserable time.  He refused to hang out with kids his own age.  But, as it turns out when you're really too young to be there both chronologically and emotionally and act up and are terrible to people, they don't want to interact with you.  And given the fact that no one was going to party with a 15-year-old kid because he's a creepy, rude fuck who is too young to get into a bar and no one wants to invite him to stuff, he spent most of that time becoming progressively more hateful instead of realizing he was the sole common denominator in every interaction he was having and failing at.   He only really had his parents as his friends, who would sometimes bring him to social events, who reinforced all of his ideas that it wasn't him - it was other people.\n\nBut he did the work.  Got his degree. He gets into grad school, at this point.  And this is where things really don't go well.  Graduate school is a lot different than undergrad.  People are there by a different kind of choice.  They're serious, they're smart, they're ready to compete.  On top of that grad school is a lot of learning to swallow your pride and go along with the wishes of mentors, committee mentors, and other people who can make or break your future career so there's a lot of doing their research, kissing their ass, building relationships, and networking with people who, again, have a lot of control over your future.   And the one thing you don't do is alienate them.\n\nThis kid wasn't up for any of this.   He wouldn't take feedback.  He wouldn't take criticism.   He gets into verbal altercations with faculty over critical feedback and grades to the point where some faculty won't meet with him or if they do, they won't without a third party present.  He was convinced because he was once a 15-year-old genius that people should just go along with his ideas and do the things he wanted.  But he was no longer 15.  He was in his early 20s and the thing that made him novel and stand out - his age- was no longer a factor because people in grad school are at least at that age if not older.\n\nAnd he was slowly iced out and pushed out of his graduate school program.  He eventually withdrew when his committee pretty much dumped him.  He went home and worked a bunch of jobs that he all got fired from because he was either too good for the work or too much of an insufferable ass to people.  No one cared about his one-time boy genius status.   He was now just a creepy, rude adult they didn't want around.\n\nMy point here is - the only thing that distinguishes your brother really, is his age in this equation.  There are plenty of people who are just as smart as him and smarter but they're not 13.  And he won't be 13 forever and at a certain point, once he ages into adulthood, no one is going to care about his one-time status as a very smart child.  \n\nYour parents need- if you can get through to them at all- need to think about the future.  He's not going to be a 13-year-old boy genius forever.  The problem with prodigies is that they grow up and stop being prodigies and the fact that they once were is only interesting at cocktail parties.  They're just adults and potentially very lonely, isolated adults.",

        "body": "I don't want to be presumptuous, but this is a really interesting comment to me and I'd like to offer my perspective. I know that I only have this post to go on, but reading this it seems as though your brother might have ADHD or another information processing disorder. I see a lot of myself in how you describe his school experience, and many of my same struggles were because of the specific problems gifted students with undiagnosed learning disabilities. \n\nIn school I had undiagnosed ADHD. I loved learning, and was able to remember enough from class that I got excellent test scores despite struggling with homework and projects. I didn't have to try very hard while I was in the school building, but I had an awful time staying focused trying to write an essay or do research on my own. I felt like I was constantly failing, but since I maintained my grades no one ever thought to look into it too much. \n\nWhen I got to college I had a much harder time with the less structured learning environment. I had to figure out different ways of managing how I learned and processed information and did end up falling behind after a couple semesters, although I found strategies that helped me get back on track and I graduated on time. \n\nBut it would make sense that if your brother's mind has quick memory processing but difficult long-term executive function, a quicker course and a less prestigious job that still satisfies his desire for a challenge would be a much better fit.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t want to be presumptuous, but this is a really interesting comment to me and I&#39;d like to offer my perspective. I know that I only have this post to go on, but reading this it seems as though your brother might have ADHD or another information processing disorder. I see a lot of myself in how you describe his school experience, and many of my same struggles were because of the specific problems gifted students with undiagnosed learning disabilities. </p>\n\n<p>In school I had undiagnosed ADHD. I loved learning, and was able to remember enough from class that I got excellent test scores despite struggling with homework and projects. I didn&#39;t have to try very hard while I was in the school building, but I had an awful time staying focused trying to write an essay or do research on my own. I felt like I was constantly failing, but since I maintained my grades no one ever thought to look into it too much. </p>\n\n<p>When I got to college I had a much harder time with the less structured learning environment. I had to figure out different ways of managing how I learned and processed information and did end up falling behind after a couple semesters, although I found strategies that helped me get back on track and I graduated on time. </p>\n\n<p>But it would make sense that if your brother&#39;s mind has quick memory processing but difficult long-term executive function, a quicker course and a less prestigious job that still satisfies his desire for a challenge would be a much better fit.

        "body": "Adding to this story from the perspective of the \"genius kid\" (spoiler I wasnt actually a genius, if I ever had the potential to be one it was quickly thrown away for my eggdonors desire to be in the spotlight amongst her social circles).\n\nMy eggdonor pushed me from a very young age to be special. I could read when I was 2 1/2-3. I could replay simple songs by ear on my musical toys. My eggdonor showed me off with pride. And that pride felt *good* to little me. But by 5-6 other kids were reading chapter books too and my \"special-ness\" began to fade. So my egg donor began to teach me math. Every night I would slave away trying to understand algebra and calculus when my peers were learning how to multiply (as was I).  I was miserable but finally I understood some of the basics of algebra and MAN, how my eggdonor GLOWED as she excitedly told all her friends/groups. She even put me in some of her college classes to sit and listen after school. I didnt understand a lick of what was going on but she was proud of me so I was happy. \n\nBut by 6th grade? It was soon gone. 6th grade was honors algebra. Literally a room full of preteens who all were \"special\" for the exact same reason as me. And in my eggdonors mind, if youre in a room full of special people *youre no longer special*.\n\nSo she started to lean into my music. As I mentioned before I had a \"talent\" for music. I could figure out most songs on whatever instrument I had on me. I wanted to play the cello. I LOVED the sound. She said no. You will play violin. The people from the local music shop came to let us try out various musical instruments to see what we liked. I tried the cello. I knew I loved the cello. I scored a 10 out of 10 on their aptitude test in all 3 categories. When my eggdonor got wind of this suddenly the cello was the best thing in the world and I had a cello by the next weekend. She raved about my music to all of her friends praising me for my skill and talent. My happiness quickly turned to dismay as she demanded more and more impressive songs. I was \"better\" than others in that I could figure out songs with relative ease but I was still a beginner! I couldnt do the songs she was demanding of me! After a blowout fight with her where she screamed at me for embarrassing her she decided to do a 180. Instead of lean into my ability with one instrument, she leaned into my ability to learn multiple instruments.  I was suddenly allowed to get a violin, viola, keyboard, and a guitar. And I loved it! New instruments! Fun! Once again eggdonor was happy. Praising me for my playing all these instruments to all her friends.\n\nBut eventually her friends got tired of hearing about her \"music prodigy daughter\". It was the only part of me she cared about other than my obedience.  This next part sounds really bad to say so understand I in no way \"blame\" my sister for what happened to me. But shortly after this.. my sister got cancer. And I was no longer the special one. My sister had always been treated better than me, with me always being compared to her looks, smarts, and social abilities (go figure the girl who is allowed to socialize with kids her own age makes lots of friends, and the girl who isnt- doesn't). \n\nBut eggdonor dropped me like a hot potato. She would spend weeks at the hospital with my sister. And while I agree she should be with my sister; she didnt take me with her. At 11-13 years old I was being left home alone for weeks at a time. Ironically one of my \"fond\" memories was when she praised me.. for making a \"grown up grocery list\". She was leaving for another 2 weeks and asked me to put together a grocery list to fend for myself. I listed a bunch of canned/microwaveable soups, apples, 2 gallons of milk, sandwich stuff, and carrots with ranch for snacks. No candy / sweets. How \"grown up\" of me. I smiled. She got what I asked for. She left. I cried. And for the next few weeks Id wake myself up in the early morning, shower, eat, dress, get myself to school on the bus, attend classes, come back home, make myself dinner, pack food for lunch, do my homework, and put myself to bed. All alone. No one but the cats. Kids played outside but I wasnt allowed out there for fear an adult would catch on to the fact I was alone and would call CPS which if caught eggdonor made clear I would lose my sister forever (different dads. If eggdonor went to jail she would go to her dad and I would go... who knows where. No one else wanted me or could afford me). \n\nAnyways after middle school my eggdonor made it clear I wasnt to play anymore it was worthless to her. She had my sister. I was to become an obedient Christian girl when she joined a church (i was openly diest at this point). Everything about me was stripped away for her pleasure. To live through me. I had to be *perfect*. \n\nThen I was given a letter allowing me to audition for Carnegie Hall. Oh my goodness. It had been 2 years since Id been allowed to play but my old teacher remembered me and put my name in the hat I guess (if I understand it correctly). I practiced like my life depended on it. She was finally proud of me. I was FINALLY special again. \n\nI didnt make it.\n\nI was so close. But no dice. Other people were just simply better be it practice or talent Ill never know nor do I want to anymore. But I remember hoa angry she was that I didnt get in. She \"already told her friends that I would be there for sure, what if they google the lineup and dont see my name?! How dare i embarrass her again!\" As though i personally sabotaged my audition so I didnt get a once in a lifetime trip to new york.\n\nLuckily it was around this time I met my now fiance, and he saw what was happening to me. He recognized it was abuse and helped me get out before I even came to terms that what had happened to me wasnt normal.\n\nBut this is to say - what the person above me said is true. I was a novelty to people, until I wasnt. As harsh as it sounds, NO ONE IS SPECIAL in a room full of special people. You need to be able to talk and work with everyone else if you want to have a good productive life. Because once youre special-ness gets striped away all thats left is *you*. And if *you* aren't a good person to talk to you will be left alone to collect dust. Just as I was every time I was deemed no longer special. I wasnt worth anything to my eggdonor if I wasnt special (though Id like to believe I was a good person she just didnt care beyond what I had to offer). But in a way my eggdonor is a good representation of strangers in your careers. Yeah they may look at you and be impressed with you at first. But you have to bring something to the table beyond special-ness because the novelty WILL wear off eventually. \n\n\nMy eggdonor was abusive. But its because she didnt care about me. And a random stranger in your career? They arent going to care about you either at first. Its nice being special. But if youre a dick? Theres a whole planet full of special people. They can find another and replace you with a better \"model\" of you. Its just the way the world works.",

But one sibling calling the other one an asshole is not a teachable moment.  Calling any other person an asshole is not showing respect for the other person and is hurtful. Obviously you are not at all receptive to my pointing out that yours and OP's behavior is indeed hurtful and out of line, yet you expect a 13 year old child to \"see the light\" and change their behavior by being called names by an obviously resentful sibling?  Lol that's cute. Is that how your parents taught you not to be a dick? By calling you an arrogant asshole or other names when you acted *gasp* like a child? If they did I'm sorry that happened to you because that's not normal, nor right. \n\nAs to your other question, obviously it's *possible* that one could be a sexual abuser at just about any age, but again, nothing of the sort was even implied in OP's post, and calling a 13 year old an incel is outrageous, and I'm not sure why you insist on seeing something sinister in this other than a spoiled kid who thinks he's great and wanted to tell his crush why he thinks he's great but she obviously didn't see it that way. I'm sure she probably has never dealt with someone like him before, so ya..*awkward* Child prodigies notoriously struggle with social skills it doesn't mean there's some kind of evil intent in this case, and AITA is an opinion. And giving someone your opinion of themselves by calling them rude names, especially when it's not asked for, is NOT good social behavior. It is hurtful, rude, out of line, and will not be well received. Ever.",

Obviously you are not at all receptive to my pointing out that yours and OP&#39;s behavior is indeed hurtful and out of line, yet you expect a 13 year old child to &quot;see the light&quot; and change their behavior by being called names by an obviously resentful sibling?  Lol that&#39;s cute. Is that how your parents taught you not to be a dick? By calling you an arrogant asshole or other names when you acted <em>gasp</em> like a child? If they did I&#39;m sorry that happened to you because that&#39;s not normal, nor right. </p>\n\n<p>As to your other question, obviously it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that one could be a sexual abuser at just about any age, but again, nothing of the sort was even implied in OP&#39;s post, and calling a 13 year old an incel is outrageous, and I&#39;m not sure why you insist on seeing something sinister in this other than a spoiled kid who thinks he&#39;s great and wanted to tell his crush why he thinks he&#39;s great but she obviously didn&#39;t see it that way. I&#39;m sure she probably has never dealt with someone like him before, so ya..<em>awkward</em> Child prodigies notoriously struggle with social skills it doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s some kind of evil intent in this case, and AITA is an opinion. And giving someone your opinion of themselves by calling them rude names, especially when it&#39;s not asked for, is NOT good social behavior. It is hurtful, rude, out of line, and will not be well received. Ever.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Hahaha even longer answer. Reddit wont let me post it so Ill split it into two comments.\n\nI agree whole heartedly with your sentiment at the end. My daughter actually has started getting the compliments of being smart or brilliant already from her physical therapist (shes 17 months old but is clever enough to figure out how to get what she wants without standing or walking. Such as using toys around her to give her more length and knock toys she wants over to the floor where she can get it. Luckily we found something that encourages her to stand. Boiled eggs lmao). Regardless I was at first excited to hear someone else call her smart. But then I snapped back and am determined as a parent to not let it get to my head. I want to give her the opportunities I never had and let her follow her passions be that dance, sports, art, or academic pursuits.  Whether she becomes a brain surgeon or a bagger at a grocery store. So long as she is happy and can get through life on her own Ill be proud. And I want her to grow up knowing its not about how smart you are, but rather you character and how you use the opportunities given to you both academically and in day to day life.\n\nAs for your question, unfortunately no. We dont speak anymore. She was always the golden child (I was compared to her, she wasnt compared to me. She was given everything I was given beatings. The list goes on). \n\nWhen I found out my eggdonor was \"stealing\" money from me I cut her off completely. (quote un quote because she technically had legal rights to the money since it was a joint account from when I was a minor so no \"theft\". But I have proof she was taking it without my permission and lying about it, even going as far as to claim there was a \"glitch at the bank\" when I held statements showing she was transferring money in and out. She brought my account down to $0.41 when I caught on. Morally its stealing in my eyes even if the law can do nothing about it). I was 8 months pregnant with my daughter, and couldnt fathom how she could do this to me. I was willing to move past multiple attempts on my life (which I am only recently coming to terms with that being what they were in therapy. Before hand it was just punishments but starving me, holding a knife against me, beating me with weapons, tossing me down the stairs, and refusing medical treatment when I desperately needed it to the extent that it ACTUALLY almost took my life had it not been for my fiance) and try to rebuild a relationship but she still.. still just didnt value me as a person. I was something to use in her eyes and she made that abundantly clear. \n\nAnyways as I mentioned my sister was treated quite differently. She was allowed to do whatever she wanted and she was never harmed for fear her father would get custody of her (my dad didnt want me [even longer twisted story] so I was basically free reign for my eggdonor). If my eggdonor so much as told my sister \"no\" she would whine to her dad and get what she wanted immediately. \n\nWhen I warned my sister of what eggdonor had done with the joint bank account so she wouldnt give eggdonor the same opprotunity she was FURIOUS at me for cutting contact with eggdonor. Apparently egg donor was \"really upset\" and it was \"all my fault\". I told her that my cutting contact was a result of egg donors actions alone and my not speaking to her didnt have to impact our relationship as sisters. But she was angry still. Asked repeatedly if I was \"really cutting contact over (and this is a quote) *MAX 1000 dollars*\". I explained that she couldve put back every penny nickel and dime but the fact was she lied, i had proof of that lie, and now that the trust was broken it could never be brought back. That quite simply this was just the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nShe wouldnt accept that and said I was putting her in the middle. I tried to tell her there *was* no middle. That Im just not talking to her. Theres no fight to be had, there is no arguing with it. Its set in stone so theres no choosing a side at the end of the day. She doesnt have to stop talking to eggdonor I wont ask her to change her relationship based on my experiences. Just respect my boundaries and we are fine. My sister then said \"if you wont talk to mom I cant talk to you\" and thus cut contact with me. \n\nAround this same time the majority of my maternal family save for my grandmother and one uncle essentially disowned me. Everyone acknowledged that I was abused and that ED is manipulative but \"thats just who she is\". Straight up my aunt said \"I know shes trying to manipulate me, i just dont let her\". That sounds like an *exhausting* way to live, knowing not a single conversation can you let your guard down. Anyways they told me they no longer wanted me to come to holidays (I didnt plan to go but it still hurt being told I wasnt welcome anymore because I wasnt talking to ED). Furthermore they said they didnt want to see, speak to, or even HOLD my daughter for fear ED would find out and be upset. I again tried to tell them we can have a relationship outside of ED's influence. If I were a coworker or random friend there would be no issue with talking to me without letting ED know, so why cant they just not tell her theyre meeting me? Its not worth the effort.",

My sister, nor my family, have said anything to me in the ways of \"hi, how are you, i miss you, lets catch up, happy new years, happy birthday, happy easter, happy Thanksgiving, merry Christmas etc\". I did get one text inviting me to Thanksgiving from my aunt - but it was at EDs house..... when I declined to attend for obvious reasons she got angry with me and said I was the only one keeping me from a family. Right.. because grabbing lunch together or sending a text is so much harder than a holiday gathering. \n\nIm getting married next year. I know its the \"no going back\" moment. If I dont invite my sister she will eventually find out and probably be upset that I \"didnt even invite my own sister!\" But quite frankly.. while it hurts like HELL ive made my peace with it. Shes determined that this is a \"choose your side battle\" and she chose my abuser. She didnt have to choose.. she really didnt I wouldve still loved her the same regardless of her relationship with ED. But to abandon me entirely in favor of ED.. I dont think we will ever be what we could have been. Furthermore as I said, not a single text. I reached out to her 2 years ago for her birthday, we hung out and had a good time. Then complete silence. She gave my daughter a Christmas gift. It was a blanket with pandas on it because she \"knows I like pandas\". I havent in years. (Theyre cute dont get me wrong but they havent been my favorite animal in *years*). Then back to complete silence. Finally I reached out to her for her birthday last year. I got engaged in October of last year so when I said happy birthday I wanted to take the opportunity one last time to try and see what we could salvage. When she asked what was new I told her about my engagement. Her response was \"oh.. good for you\". I always thought she would be by my side. That this was going to be one of the exciting moments that made things worth it. Its why I didnt tell the truth to CPS any of the 3 times becuase I didnt want to lose her.. but shes just so disinterested in my life. She claims it will stay this way until I make things right with eggdonor. Unfortunately I can say with certainty that it will never happen. \n\nNow its been months without so much as a hi from her. And Im done chasing her. If she wanted a relationship with me she has every ability to get it and I made sure she knew that. She just doesnt. \n\nIf by this time next year shes still not speaking to me I will cut contact with her completely just as I have done with the rest of my maternal family that told me they didnt want me in favor of ED. It was never supposed to divide the family like this, I just wanted to protect myself and my daughter. But now I am coming to terms with it. \n\nMy therapist and I have been working on it and the more I delve into the past the more I see how I glanced over their flaws because of my love and loyalty to them. The reality is that many of them are addicted to drugs and alcohol, mooch off of one another, and can be down right *mean*. One uncle is pretty nice overall but hes never consistently there when you need him. My grandmother is a beautiful woman inside and out, but she doesnt want to lose access to my cousins and sister so shes treading carefully - buts shes also the only one to talk to me regularly out of my entire family. It was always so pressed into me that family is everything. Blood over water yadayadayada. But when it counted they abandoned me when they didnt even have to. Im done with them.\n\nIll leave the door open for my sister if she ever truly needs my help in the future. I love her too much still to completely shut her out without any other provocation. But we will never be the sisters I dreamt we would be when I finally escaped that nightmare. I thought she would be happy for me. Im finally *happy!* I have a house, stable income, I can eat whatever and whenever I want without permission! I can even see a doctor or a dentist whenever I want; and because Im not being beaten or starved anymore I dont have a need to much anymore! Im *loved* and *valued* for my mind. And I have the most amazing goofball of a daughter who takes after her most amazing goofball of a father. And the wedding! Oh my goodness I can actually get married! I was told constantly by ED that I would get pregnant by the first man who said he loved me (which I suppose she got right) and be abandoned. That no one could ever love \"scum like me\". My ring says otherwise. \n\nIt is what it is. Talking about it is cathartic now because I know when I type it all out that I made the right choices no matter how hard my heart is screaming. If she doesnt want me anymore.. then I cant change her. End of.\n\n(Sorry for the novella.
