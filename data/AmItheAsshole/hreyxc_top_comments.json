My query is: was it really the breed that the woman here was concerned about, or was picking up caring for a dog too much when combined with kids? seriously, depending on the dog, it\u2019s a <em>lot</em>. people shouldn\u2019t have energetic dogs and really young kids, the work is exhausting. Absolutely she\u2019s the asshole for how she behaved - it\u2019s inexcusable. But it strikes me what she did to the dog might represent a bigger issue around caring, responsibility and the mental load.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "ESH. So what I'm getting from all this, assuming it's not made up, is that you had a dog going into marriage, your wife seems alright around the dog and then became pregnant. At that point she became anxious about the dog and expressed that concern to you, frequently. You blew her off and told her the dog was \"trained,\" I'm assuming that doesn't mean that you put on a tape of a child crying for 3-4 hours to see how that would impact the dog. So as your wife's due date was nearing and she was becoming more and more anxious about this dog, you continued to ignore her, backing her into a corner. Her baby or a dog. Your dog. So she as a mother did the only thing she could possibly think of, after having told you she was horrified for her child, and got rid of the dog. So then, you searched for a few weeks, while failing to check the pound for your beloved pet. Flash forward, and she's now had 2 more children, and is a stay at home mother and you want her to get over her anxiety of dogs, and raise one by herself along with the children because *you* want a dog? Also, you can't leave because you live on her families property? \n\nOkay, full stop, your newborn was your ACTUAL BABY. The dog, and any dog, comes second to a real human child. YOUR CHILD should've been your number 1 concern. You really have absolutely no idea how a dog will handle a newborn. They cry for hours at a time, they're up and down, they take all of your attention. That's very stressful for a dog, and even the best trained, best around other children dog, might not have the capacity to deal with a newborn. \n\nWhen your wife expressed these concerns, your thoughts should have been with hers. You both could've worked on a solution to the dog issue. You decided your dogs \"training\" was enough, and didn't even attempt to find a solution to ease your wife's mind. You chose the dog over your wife and child. And what if, god forbid, the dog would've stayed in the home, and after a month or two of this baby screaming and crying and getting all of the attention, the dog had attacked someone? Maybe the baby, maybe your wife. What would've happened then? Was your wife supposed to wait until something devastating happened? \n\nSo after asking for months  for a solution, she comes up with one herself. I'm sure her parents heard the entire time how she asked and you said no, how she begged and you ignored her, how she cried for the safety of YOUR ACTUAL CHILD and you puffed, and rolled your eyes and said it would be fine. So when she says for the last time, just a few weeks before giving birth, \"Mom, dad, I'm really scared. I can't bring my baby home with this dog here. He won't listen, can you help me?\" They agree, and they take the dog to the pound. \n\nWho knows what happened at the pound, maybe your dog was adopted, maybe they were euthanized on the spot. But in all your time searching, you never looked at the pound? How good of a dog owner are you to not think of the most obvious place. The place where someone else would have taken the dog, if they'd found it. And even if, they'd put the dog down immediately, they would've remembered your dog and had a record of it being there. You would've known. \n\nSo now, after 2 more kids, it comes out somehow that the dog was taken to the pound. You're justified in your anger for being lied to. But only in being lied to. You backed your wife into a corner and she made the only choice she had left. \n\nSo now, you've decided you're going to get a dog, despite your wife not liking them, and her having to be the primary care taker. Which just makes you an incredible asshole, to put a new puppy in a home with 3 children under 5, a wife who is already at her wits end, and who DOES NOT WANT THEM. What kind of life is that dog going to have? Let's say, in the best of circumstance that you bring home a dog, that she doesn't immediately take to the pound, let's even go as far to say she does take the time to train it, and walk it everyday, she's not going to love it. It's not going to be wanted. It's going to pick up on the anger and resentment, and it's going to live a horribly sad life, even if she did everything \"right\" because she DOESN'T WANT A DOG, and you haven't the time for one. It is horribly selfish to want to force a dog to live like that to \"win\" this. \n\nAdditionally, It seems very strange to me that you'd want full custody over children you cannot take care of during the day, who are used to being with their mother, and whom you are unable to house. And that's not mentioning that you would have risked their lives for a dog. This wanting full custody comes across as another way to get back at your wife, without considering your children. Though that doesn't surprise me considering, you prioritized a dog above them. \n\nIf this is real, and I truly hope it isn't, you're not the only victim here. Although that is the tale you want to tell. You're selfish, and your priorities are backwards. You have actual babies. Children who are your own flesh and blood and you're still placing them below your \"baby\" dog. \n\nYou and your wife desperately need therapy, both couples and individual. If you choose to divorce over a decision you forced her hand in, then so be it. But at some point, you've got to recognize that this is a mess of your own making, and that other outcomes where possible, if only you'd cared enough for your wife and growing family to consider them.\n\nETA: If the dog was so well trained, you could've considered a foster to help everyone transition with the new child. You could've rehomed to someone near by so that you could visit. You could talked to your vet about preparing your dog for a newborn, or out the dog into a training program for that. There were plenty of options, had you just taken your wife's concerns seriously.",

Pounds aren't flush, they are likely using the same system and are too timepoor to archive records. you could likely find the date because you may have done a Facebook post about a lost dog during that time.\n\nAt least you have a chance for closure and to know what happened.\n\nI think this is a divorce worthy reason to leave. she betrayed you, lied to you, she took away your choice over something you loved, she watched you worry, grieve, hope that your dog would come back and said nothing. And she lied and continued to lie. And likely, indirectly murdered your dog.\n\nI would not stay in the relationship without big acts of contrition. I don't mean money, I do mean it gotta hurt though. It can't be lip service. I'm talking options like, she owns what she did publically in a Facebook post, accepting the judgement of friends and family, accepting what she did was cruel and harsh. Or she goes to individual therapy consistently, she admits her faults, in full, no equivocation, no denials, no misdirection, no justification. I did a bad thing. This was hurtful. It was hurtful is these ways. It continued to be hurtful. I betrayed your trust. I betrayed your love. I was selfish. Yeah there are buts, e.g. she was worried about the kids, but being an adult is being able to apologise without saying them. You own your bad.\n\nI would say this is a very very very very black mark on her character. I would see this as a trust breach equivalent to an affair. I would see it as causing malicious pain. I would see it as malicious as what it is, killing the family dog and lying about it. Whether or not the dog was rehomed or put down, she killed your dog in your eyes, you accepted at some point she died in the wilderness or was hit by a car. \n\nThis isn't fixable by a dog. I agree with those comments. Don't bring another innocent animal around such a dangerous animal (your wife), she could do real harm, she has a history of aggression with other dogs. Which is ironic, she became what she feared the dog would be.\n\nHonestly I think you should at the least separate. I would look legally at your ability to get joint custody. I think overall your children would be better off with one parent some of the time who is rational and loving rather than a broken home. I think you can find out if this is worth saving by how hard she works to undo the damage she did. Are your feelings worth anything or should they be minimised? If she is unable to see to you it was more than 'just a dog' how will she connect with your children and see that something important to them is more than just a guitar, or just a toy? That behaviour is damaging. It shows a lack of empathy.\n\nBe ready for mistrust to pop up over other things now your trust has been broken. you'll have rushes of intense love and urges to somehow fix it with a new dog, or renewing vows, because you'll desperately want this betrayal to not be as big as it is. You'll start to worry about affairs, paternity, other scams she could be running. This seesaw is normal to experience, but you'll need to control how you behave because your children shouldn't be destabilized from it.\n\nThis is why I think a separation is also helpful but make sure you keep up access to the children like you would if you already had a custody agreement in place. Don't ever drop your role as a parent and seek legal advice.\n\nI think an easy exercise is to quantify your relationship into metrics and understand its new status.\n\nAt the moment trust is below the threshold of a relationship. You would never even date someone you distrust to that level.\n\nYour view of her - loving wife, nope. Supportive, nope. Cares about your well-being, nope. Truthful, nope. Can be trusted around animals, NOPE.\n\nYou can build your relationship back, but it will need to be from that place. You can't sweep this new state of the relationship under the rug and pretend it ran away. I find the hardest step is to accept the change, and then rebuild from there. If you can accept that, you have a head start on maybe rebuilding a healthy marriage with someone who earned that second chance.",

What she did to the dog was stunningly cruel (especially the POUND not even a loving home, I almost cried just thinking about it) and she betrayed her husband (understatement) but...lets say she was right and OP was in denial. The baby's safety comes first. What should she have done? They needed to come to a decision together, but if OP refused to listen or even consider her concerns then that would be an extremely hard call. Everyone here is calling her a psychopath but she was pregnant and if she truly believed that dog was a danger than she's going to have a strong instinct to make sure that doesn't happen. Those protective instincts that kick in when pregnant or the child is born are powerful and very real. Actual fear for her child might lead to callousness or being irrational. And clearly her parents validated and encouraged her and and most people trust their parents. I'm not excusing her at all, I just think we need to understand her state of mind.\n\nI'm thinking she should have insisted that the Dog be socialized around babies before theirs was born. I'm not sure how though bc what if he hurts someone else's baby? I have to think there was *someone* they could have contacted, their vet, an expert, the local trainer, whatever to advise on the situation and how to keep the baby and the dog safe, right? Plus dogs should be prepared for babies even if they're safe! I'm gonna go with ESH bc it was also his responsibility to make sure the dog was prepared for the baby and to help his wife get past her fears instead of getting angry and defensive causing resentment on both sides that lead to this. (Not blaming him but he should have handled it differently). And now he's demanding another dog?!! WTF? Without any of the original issues solved or trust restored or taking into account her feelings, bc if she doesn't want one how does he think that's gonna go? What kind of home is that for a dog? OP sounds selfish no matter how wrong she was to do what she did. Marriage counseling is needed before divorce, they have *kids,* maybe with a separation, idk.",

There are legitimately just some people out there who don\u2019t understand how or why an animal could be that important. They view them as possessions.
