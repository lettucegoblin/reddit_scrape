A young woman (albeit older than you, but probably less mature after becoming a father) probably doesn\u2019t want that responsibility. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t dramatize so much to think she would hurt him from her negativity- but I would also be wary of who you have watch him anyways. I think the whole situation seems shitty for everyone but accusing her of potentially purposeful harm may be a bit much. Accidental or neglect though... who knows. \n\nOn a side note- as a fellow single dad- I want to say kudos to you for rocking it! It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s not always rewarding for awhile. But you got this. \n\nNot sure you need it at all but the mistakes I made if you ever need it; don\u2019t get with a new woman just because you want some help, and do your best to raise your son yourself. The biggest thing I learned is that the more people watch your kid, the more they think they have a \u201cright\u201d to them. To decide what\u2019s best, or to do things without your permission. That\u2019s not true. He\u2019s yours. You know what\u2019s best. \n\nKeep rocking it!",

His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.\n\nThe other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nI asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your instincts about your sister may or may not be right, but they probably are -- it's a shame, but it sounds like she really resents her nephew for waking her up at night and bringing typical newborn chaos into the house. That's what babies do and she's never had a chance to punish you for the time when it was *you* doing this to her when you were a baby and she was a toddler. \n\nPlease tell your parents that they need to settle down and let the issue about your sister go ASAP.  It's not healthy for them to think that she's the best caregiver for your child simply because she's a woman and her feelings were hurt. Having a uterus makes her *biologically* capable of  *bearing* a child, but it doe ***NOT*** make her more naturally inclined to be a better person to watch over *yours*. They need to stop treating you like a child for protecting your baby, too. Please tell them an old granny online said they're being fucking stupid for sending you to your room for following year instincts as a father. I'm more than happy to go toe to toe with them if you'd like to set up a chat between us, because my *kids* are probably older than they are, and my kids don't act that idiotic.\n\nTake care of your little one as you have been, and yourself.

Your instincts about your sister may or may not be right, but they probably are -- it&#39;s a shame, but it sounds like she really resents her nephew for waking her up at night and bringing typical newborn chaos into the house. That&#39;s what babies do and she&#39;s never had a chance to punish you for the time when it was <em>you</em> doing this to her when you were a baby and she was a toddler. </p>\n\n<p>Please tell your parents that they need to settle down and let the issue about your sister go ASAP.  It&#39;s not healthy for them to think that she&#39;s the best caregiver for your child simply because she&#39;s a woman and her feelings were hurt. Having a uterus makes her <em>biologically</em> capable of  <em>bearing</em> a child, but it doe <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> make her more naturally inclined to be a better person to watch over <em>yours</em>. They need to stop treating you like a child for protecting your baby, too. Please tell them an old granny online said they&#39;re being fucking stupid for sending you to your room for following year instincts as a father. I&#39;m more than happy to go toe to toe with them if you&#39;d like to set up a chat between us, because my <em>kids</em> are probably older than they are, and my kids don&#39;t act that idiotic.</p>\n\n<p>Take care of your little one as you have been, and yourself. You&#39;re doing a great job! Love, Granny \u2661</p>\n</div>",

I was a teenager when I had my daughter, I remember I had known this couple in their twenties for a long time and had gone to visit them with another friend who had known them for even longer. My friend wanted me to go to the shop with him because he needed a few things but had no money, my daughter was a famously bad sleeper and had just fallen asleep in her buggy, I didn\u2019t want to take her out and so my friend suggested I leave her with the couple, I was hesitant about they said they\u2019d be more than happy to watch her, we would only be 20 minutes. On the way to the shop we were taking about the couple and I asked if he knew if they had talked about having kids of their own, my friend said \u2018they had one, it was taken away\u2019. I didn\u2019t even wait to find out why, I sprinted back to the house, made an excuse and took my daughter home, needless to say I haven\u2019t spoken to any of them since.\nThese people were friends of mine, they had always expressed how adorable my my daughter was, never that she was annoying or cried too much, etc, and yet knowing what I do now I still cringe 14 years later remembering that I left her with them for 5 minutes.

Babies ARE a lot of work, they\u2019re loud, they take up a lot of time and attention- she didn\u2019t choose to have one, and neither did OPs parents- but they\u2019re all living with the consequences. I\u2019m her age, living at home to save for school, and if my 19 year old brother (I have one, too!) moved back home with a baby he\u2019d never planned on having, there would be some growing pains. OPs sister sounds disinterested and somewhat frustrated, but she doesn\u2019t sound like a direct DANGER to me. I would be wary of treating her as though these few months of irritation have irreversibly damaged her relationship with the baby- she seems willing to help, and maybe now that she\u2019s aware of how OP has viewed her actions the past few months, she may change them. Maybe she\u2019s just finally getting used to the changes in her home. Maybe the kid is finally old enough to be kind of fun (3mo is awesome) so she\u2019s more interested. She\u2019s got the rest of her life to be a good aunt- hopefully that starts now. I\u2019ve heard of new DADS who are less interested in their newborns than she is in yours, so there\u2019s hope for everyone!",
