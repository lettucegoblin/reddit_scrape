Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle\u2019s (I\u2019ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the \u201ckids room\u201d which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They\u2019ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.\n\nThe other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I\u2019ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.\n\nH\u2019s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I\u2019ve been to their house before, it\u2019s horrible). \n\nAnyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room.

        "body": "I was invited to a weekend at my ex's parents. His aunt and uncle brought their 5 kids... I dont want children, I don't deal with kids under 10 as I am a *high school teacher* and not primary. But everyone shoved the kids off on me cause \"thats what the female cousins always do but they arent here rn\". So I spend some time explaining to them why the sky was blue, and playing with them as my now-ex was having a beer with his brother. Then bedtime came. We had just lit a campfire, I had taken my evening meds and sat down with a still untouched glass of wine to spend some time with now-ex... and the aunt goes: \"who do you want to bring you to bed, me or WaddenSeaSiren?\" *Excuse me, I don't remember offering my services to brush 5 kids teeth, take them to the toilet, and tell them a story.* The kids voted me, and I said \"I don't think so, I just sat down and I am talking to my boyfriend right now.\" The whole now-ex-inlaws were upset by that so I ended up doing it anyway. I had never ever seen these kids before, had never done any baby- or kidrelated things before, and all of a sudden I had to dress and brush and toilet all these brats. I was *livid*, but I wasnt about to dissappoint those kids that looked up to me. When I came back they asked \"Isnt it nice, kids? I bet you can't wait to have kids.\" I replied: \"I f*cking hate young kids. I dont want to have them. They annoy the fuck out of me, I'd rather die.\" Then I drowned my untouched wine in one go, and grabbed the bottle to refill.\nI never had to hang out with those shits again. Fuck parents who have kids but shove them off on others. Just because I have a fanny doesnt mean I want to take care of your crotchgoblins. xD",
