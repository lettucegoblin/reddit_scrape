My sister sucks. She is a horrible self slcentered person who thinks she is the main character.\nShe is not only a horrible person, she is a step monster.\n\nShe married this guy... Who is a freaking push over... 3 years ago. He has two children. 10 and 6. My sister constantly complains about them. Saying things like the 6 year old is gross because he sips too loud or has stained clothing. For the love of god.... He is 6. That's what a child is supposed to do. And she is so mean to the 10 year old girl. She alts straight out jealous of her. I've caught her taunting her that daddy loves my sister more than her. She is horrible.\n\nI have straight up called her out (after trying to talk to her like a million times) . At Christmas she was saying, that I'd be nice to have the kids there and I said \"why... You hate them?\". This was when everything was almost over and she had been bragging to her friends that her husband had spend more on her than on daughter. A fight ensued. My parents reprimanded me but my cousins took my side and called her out, noting every moment that they had witnessed her being horrible. Her husband obviously took her side and said, that she was a wonderful step mother and that the kids love her. To which I said that was a lie, as I had consoled them countless times after they were taunted by my sister. They left and we haven't talked since.\n\nOne day I was running errands and run into my step nephews who were with their mother. I had never met her... And honestly she is wonderful. We decided to have some coffee. While the kids were playing, she asked me how her children behaved etc. I said they were wonderful and then I just spilled the beans on my sister. How awful she was. What I've heard her say to the kids, the inaction of her ex husband. By the end she was horrified. She said the kids didn't like her. But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father's life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I'd be willing to \"testify\". She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father&#39;s life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I&#39;d be willing to &quot;testify&quot;. She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim. Am I the asshole?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
