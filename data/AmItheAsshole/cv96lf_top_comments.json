However, I can see how people might think that's wrong, but honestly if people want to be petty about stupid shit they should expect it to be thrown right back at them. If all the details you gave are accurate then your \"friends\" have their heads so far up their ass the oxygen deprivation is probably what's making them so stupid. They explicitly wanted the photo removed simply because they both were in it (presumably right next to each other) while EVERYONE had their arms around each other. This in no way anyone could ever interpret that as them even being friends, let alone having an intimate relationship (given they were posing like everyone else and not doing something obvious like tight hugging or kissing). I'm willing to bet the only reason they reacted the way they did is because they have that mentality that celebrities are always being watched and get nitpicked for EVERYTHING. This holds true... if you're an actual celebrity. It's good to have goals but if you're in high school and say you're gonna be doctor don't walk around acting like you can cure cancer when you're knowledge doesn't even stem beyond basic biology and health classes. People have a right to want a photo of them being taken down because it's usually an inconvenience to them (they think they look ugly, they're holding alcohol and they're underage, etc) however at this point they're inconveniencing you by asking you to take down a normal post that I probably see 5 times a day on Instagram solely because their ego doesn't want you to hurt their non-existent fame. Before any of you rip into me saying that I don't respect common decency or whatever think about it like this. You're hanging out with the bros at a party, having the time of your life and you want to take a photo. It turns out to be a good photo, it's literally just your friends. No alcohol, no drugs, no fucked up faces, no way whatsoever you could tell it's party. Just some dudes being bros. You decide to post it on social media but then one of your friends promptly messages you asking to delete it because they don't want their chances of getting into a good college or a getting a good job to be affected by this photo. Pretty stupid right? Their whole reasoning behind why they want the photo down doesn't match up with real life. I will admit, that wasn't the best analogy off the top of my head, and is undoubtedly and easier situation to handle than OP's, but my point still stands. If you want me to delete a photo of you I have posted, I will happily do it. But if you bring to me some bullshit excuse that doesn't even apply then expect a rebuttal from me. To reiterate, there are MANY valid reasons for wanting a photo taken down, but if the risk you're presenting to the poster isn't a real risk then you genuinely don't have a good reason and you're just making the poster delete something they wanted posted for literally no reason. Seriously guys, if you're that much of a wuss about it at least make up an excuse like \"I'm just not comfortable having my face in photos\" so that if I'm deleting it I actually think I have a reason to instead of pandering to your shit ideology",

I have a friend who absolutely hates social media and gets really upset when we upload photos of him; maybe to a point of unreasonableness.  I'm a friend though so I'd remove it if requested, even if unreasonable.\n\nI have another friend that has his own illusions of grandeur.  I used to get annoyed at it and not say anything because I just didn't want to listen to it; but my wife pointed out to me, so what? Who is he hurting by having his little fantasy?  Just let him have it.  Yeah, he's full of shit, but so what?\n\nMaybe their reasons for wanting the photo removed are stupid. Maybe they have unrealistic images of their fame.  At the end of the day though, they're your friends; treat others as you'd want to be treated and all.  What are you gaining by keeping the photo on social media?  Do all the people not there really need to see it? \n\nHolding onto the photo and not removing it from social media because of the principle of it is what makes you the asshole.  Maybe they're a little petty and weird about the whole thing, but everyone has their weird quirks.  Just because it's off whatever social media platform, doesn't mean the photo doesn't exist and you can't look at it or print it out if it means that much to you.",

The person who is serving time has managed to slip out twice and been gone for a month or more both times. And both times they had to pack up and find someone to take them in until he was caught. Then they'd have to move, again.\n\nI wish everyone would have that moment to make sure. You never know what's really going on in someone's personal life. Sometimes breakups result in online stalking, some people don't want others to know who they are with, etc.",
