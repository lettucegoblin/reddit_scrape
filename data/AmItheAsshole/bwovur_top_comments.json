This is extremely important for them to have and you sound like a great parent who enforced boundaries and your children respect you enough to follow through with those boundaries and feel bad for crossing them. \n\nYears ago I snuck out and went to a party, my parents were extremely extreeeeeemely religious and as a result had a heavy hand with discipline. I couldn\u2019t tell them anything. After drinking heavily with friends I exited someone\u2019s vehicle assuming I was only a 10 minute walk from my house. I was so drunk that I didn\u2019t realize I was in the middle of downtown... which at 3am was crawling with the wrong type of people. I had no one to call to get me. I walked home in the dark, had to walk though a dangerous area and was approached by a couple men who talked to me about who knows what while clearly high out of their minds. When I got home I realized I wasn\u2019t going to be able to get in the house without making any noise again. I waited until 6am and texted my mom that I was out for a morning \u201crun\u201d. What I did was cry in the park for a while, ashamed at how I put myself in such a dangerous position by myself. Had I gone missing. There\u2019s little chance anyone would have known where I was, trusting a bunch of 16 year olds to be responsible is a poor idea... I wished I could have called my mom to get me. \n\nWell done dad.

This is extremely important for them to have and you sound like a great parent who enforced boundaries and your children respect you enough to follow through with those boundaries and feel bad for crossing them. </p>\n\n<p>Years ago I snuck out and went to a party, my parents were extremely extreeeeeemely religious and as a result had a heavy hand with discipline. I couldn\u2019t tell them anything. After drinking heavily with friends I exited someone\u2019s vehicle assuming I was only a 10 minute walk from my house. I was so drunk that I didn\u2019t realize I was in the middle of downtown... which at 3am was crawling with the wrong type of people. I had no one to call to get me. I walked home in the dark, had to walk though a dangerous area and was approached by a couple men who talked to me about who knows what while clearly high out of their minds.

Do you think your wife would react poorly? Does your step daughter feel that she would? No matter what, if you do decide to tell your wife I\u2019d talk about it with your step daughter first and tell her. You could even ask her permission first (since you did make a verbal agreement, it sounds like) and go from there.

But I\u2019ve always felt that my actual loyalty is first to the kids and if they trust me enough to confide in me, whether it\u2019s a big deal or a small one, I won\u2019t take that lightly and just go blabbing to their parents.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is, direct responses/punishments are often ineffective, and you can do more good by being a trusted confidant (and a positive role model) for the kid.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I\u2019m saying I\u2019d most likely do the same thing as you, but it\u2019s very situation dependent. Do you think your wife would react poorly? Does your step daughter feel that she would? No matter what, if you do decide to tell your wife I\u2019d talk about it with your step daughter first and tell her. You could even ask her permission first (since you did make a verbal agreement, it sounds like) and go from there. MAYBE she\u2019ll no longer trust you but at least you\u2019re being upfront with her.</p>\n</div>",

First, the most important relationship is between you and your wife. You are lying to her about something very important. Also, if you give your kids an opportunity, they will choose favorites (you are now good cop) and in the end manipulate you both. You and your wife are a team. You just switched teams on her without her knowing it.\n\nAlso, it seems like I might be in the minority here, but I believe that telling your step-daughter she can call you any time to get her out of trouble no questions asked is different from saying no consequences and no telling Mom. Kids need limits, structure, and yes, consequences. While she did the right thing by calling you, this should not be a \"done and over with\" kind of thing. You are missing out on a learning opportunity. She can learn from this, even have consequences (natural or otherwise), without judgement or even \"questions asked\". \n\nI'm happy she called you to get her out of a bad situation. However, you can still build a strong relationship while making it clear that there are still consequences for behaviors, that there are not secrets from mom, and that problems need to be discussed afterwards so that they don't happen again. I think the biggest difference is that essentially you promised not to act out of emotion or anger but rather calmly, rationally, with empathy and understanding.",

You just switched teams on her without her knowing it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it seems like I might be in the minority here, but I believe that telling your step-daughter she can call you any time to get her out of trouble no questions asked is different from saying no consequences and no telling Mom. Kids need limits, structure, and yes, consequences. While she did the right thing by calling you, this should not be a &quot;done and over with&quot; kind of thing. You are missing out on a learning opportunity. She can learn from this, even have consequences (natural or otherwise), without judgement or even &quot;questions asked&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy she called you to get her out of a bad situation. However, you can still build a strong relationship while making it clear that there are still consequences for behaviors, that there are not secrets from mom, and that problems need to be discussed afterwards so that they don&#39;t happen again. I think the biggest difference is that essentially you promised not to act out of emotion or anger but rather calmly, rationally, with empathy and understanding.</p>\n</div>",

They\u2019re not reading the news or searching about how to have safe sex. They\u2019re watching YouTube and posting on Instagram. \n\nI have access on how to build a house, since I have the internet. That doesn\u2019t mean I actually know how to build a house, or will ever research and read about it.  Same goes for teens and topics they are bored by- which is basically everything important and responsible.\n\nETA: this was a very general statement I made. Thank you for not crucifying me if you misinterpreted my meaning. I do not believe every teenager is shallow and doesn\u2019t want to learn. I don\u2019t think it means they\u2019re terrible people if they don\u2019t, just that they\u2019re entitled and making a choice to be uninformed.\n\nThat being said! *Assault/abuse/rape are NEVER ok*.  As one poster commented, you can be informed, know the dangers, do everything right, and still get hurt.\n\nKnowing what precautions to take, what red flags to look for, and generally being informed can help people avoid danger. But I do understand that it\u2019s not a bullet-proof vest.

I don\u2019t know many teenagers that actually use the internet to learn unless it\u2019s for school. They\u2019re not reading the news or searching about how to have safe sex. They\u2019re watching YouTube and posting on Instagram. </p>\n\n<p>I have access on how to build a house, since I have the internet. That doesn\u2019t mean I actually know how to build a house, or will ever research and read about it.  Same goes for teens and topics they are bored by- which is basically everything important and responsible.</p>\n\n<p>ETA: this was a very general statement I made. Thank you for not crucifying me if you misinterpreted my meaning. I do not believe every teenager is shallow and doesn\u2019t want to learn. I don\u2019t think it means they\u2019re terrible people if they don\u2019t, just that they\u2019re entitled and making a choice to be uninformed.</p>\n\n<p>That being said! <em>Assault/abuse/rape are NEVER ok</em>.  As one poster commented, you can be informed, know the dangers, do everything right, and still get hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing what precautions to take, what red flags to look for, and generally being informed can help people avoid danger. But I do understand that it\u2019s not a bullet-proof vest.

This is why slut shaming is so effective. \"Well she was wearing the wrong thing/acting the wrong way/doing something-anything wrong. I'm not, therefore I'm safe.\" In reality, it just doesn't matter what you're wearing, etc.\n\nOP--Speaking as a former teenage girl who raised a teenage girl, I wouldn't add any punishment into the mix. That will just dissuade her next time, and may cause her to stay in a dangerous situation. Will telling mom necessitate punishment? Can you guys agree to not punish/disparage her?",
