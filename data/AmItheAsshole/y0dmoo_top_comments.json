I\u2019m hoping this is genuine delusions, but your wife is literally teaching her daughter that the world will revolve around and cater to her and is masking your refusal to buy into that as favoritism towards your own daughter. You\u2019re not favoring anyone, you\u2019re treating them both equally and your wife needs to understand that there are events in life where things won\u2019t be about her and her daughter, just as there will be events where things <em>are</em>. Your daughter\u2019s birthday isn\u2019t about her daughters preferences, and vice versa. All of your wife\u2019s behavior is incredibly hypocritical, considering your wife went behind your back to make sure her daughter got the cake flavor she wanted, at the expense of your own\u2019s birthday experience.</p>\n</div>",

There's zero excuse for an adult to not see how they are treating a child poorly.\n\nMy mom on birthdays would get every kid a very small cheap gift. The birthday kid got a bunch of gifts obviously.

Not chosen her daughter over yours and tried to force her to eat a cake she doesnt like on her OWN birthday.\n\nYour wife needs to go to family counseling if she really doesn't see how messed up this was. I feel for your daughter. She sees the favoritism. If your wife acts this way in front of you, imagine how she acts when you're not around. Most kids won't tell their parents either.

The stories I told her broke her heart and angered her so much she actually called my dad to tell him off. Which she never spoke to him because she absolutely hated him. \n\nThis really upsets me that your daughter is getting the shit end of the stick with your wife.

Say Olivia gets into med school but Britney couldn\u2019t, your wife is the type to insist Olivia can\u2019t go to med school because it\u2019s not fair to Britney. It\u2019s going to apply to education, cars, weddings, family events, grandkids, etc. You need to think long and hard about all the red flags you have ignored up till this point and perhaps talk to your daughter. My bet is that she has been told many times over, behind your back, that SHE is the one who needs to comprise to make Britney feel welcomed. </p>\n\n<p>Guaranteed there is a lot more going on behind the scenes you are not aware of that your daughter hasn\u2019t told you.</p>\n</div>",

She wants special treatment for her daughter by making anything about Olivia &quot;fair&quot; to her daughter. But Britney is old enough to know someone else&#39;s birthday isn&#39;t about her. It&#39;s not favoritism to get a cake your daughter actually likes for her birthday! The fact the cake was mostly vanilla with a LITTLE chocolate for Olivia is the sign. She could have added the pieces of vanilla to the main chocolate cake if it&#39;s such a problem for Britney. But there is no reason for most of the cake to be a flavor She won&#39;t like on her birthday!! Your wife is unhinged.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Could not agree more!\n\nDon't get me wrong, selfishness is usually seen as a very negative and toxic behavior, and this is true! HOWEVER! It is not wrong to be selfish once in a while. If all a person does is give and give and give, eventually they'll run empty, and feel all the worse for it. It is not wrong to have a day for yourself. Birthdays are just the day where you have it for yourself and celebrate with others while doing so. You get to do whatever you want, have your favorite foods, and enjoy being you.\n\nOP, what you did in defense of your daughter was absolutely correct. What your wife attempted was very wrong of her. If it really bothered her that much that the cake would be a flavor her daughter hated, a small container of vanilla ice cream could've been purchased, but to change the entire birthday cake? Now *that's* inappropriate entitlement. I would hope this is just a mistaken idea your wife has, but more than likely this is a very strong mommy/daughter duo where mommy gets everything her daughter wants and no one else is allowed to be happy when her daughter isn't/won't be.\n\nI think you may need to have a discussion with your wife. It is, unfortunately, highly likely that your wife is playing favorites in a way that won't end well. If she refuses to back down, you may want to rethink the relationship you two have. I worry that she may constantly sideline your daughter in favor of her own.\n\nBest of luck, and I do wish Olivia a (belated) happy birthday, and many more happy birthdays to come (complete with chocolate cakes!)\n\nEdit: forgot to add my judgment!

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Could not agree more!</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, selfishness is usually seen as a very negative and toxic behavior, and this is true! HOWEVER! It is not wrong to be selfish once in a while. If all a person does is give and give and give, eventually they&#39;ll run empty, and feel all the worse for it. It is not wrong to have a day for yourself. Birthdays are just the day where you have it for yourself and celebrate with others while doing so. You get to do whatever you want, have your favorite foods, and enjoy being you.</p>\n\n<p>OP, what you did in defense of your daughter was absolutely correct. What your wife attempted was very wrong of her. If it really bothered her that much that the cake would be a flavor her daughter hated, a small container of vanilla ice cream could&#39;ve been purchased, but to change the entire birthday cake? Now <em>that&#39;s</em> inappropriate entitlement.

My dad still had to work so I just kept living with my grandparents.  My dad always spent time with me when he was home.  I wish my mom hadn't passed but I had a pretty good life.  When he was home he would stay in their old room or we would go on vacations.  \n\nMy grandparents both passed away over the last couple of years from COVID and complications.  My mom was an only child and so am I. My mom's life insurance went to my dad, and he used it to help renovate the house.  My grandparents never charged him rent.

I guess she wants her mom to come live with her and help.  My dad never told it the house is mine.  \n\nSo my dad came home last weekend and we had a long talk.
