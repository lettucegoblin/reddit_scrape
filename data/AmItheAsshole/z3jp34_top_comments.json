Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking on her behavior after the second time in a week.\n\n\nShe'd barge in, then turns and says \"oh sorry\" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me thrn flatout said \"so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's fammmillly!!\". He seriously said that!.\n\n\nWe have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.\n\nSo I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she \"accidemtly\" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first but she told my husband about it claiming she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom\". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel \"terrifued/weirded out\" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
