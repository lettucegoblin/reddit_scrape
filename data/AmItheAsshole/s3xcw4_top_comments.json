We're talking about making it a home for both of us.\n\nBut as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. \n\nWhen his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. \n\nWhen I am bothered, she's like \"I was just helping with chores\" etc. He says I should just let her because she has \"a lot of nervous energy\" \n\nOne thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little \"affirmation\" post it note on my monitor saying \"I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things\" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. \n\nAnyway, she made a comment to about my ego... \n\nBut as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of \"affirmations\" to hide.\n\nSome were:\nMedicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!\nKitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!\nWork desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! \nWalk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!\n\nThere were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. \n\nNext time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. \n\nI went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. \n\nHe asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? \n\nHe said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.\n\nI was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit\"\n\nHe asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.\n\nHe said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!\n\nAITA for the note prank?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not for her to have her biweekly rummage &amp; tidy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here was the most alarming part for me:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said I was making stuff hard for him, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is not up to you to pussyfoot around his mother and allow her to violate your privacy so he can avoid whatever guilt trip she\u2019s doing to throw at him. This is a clear sign she\u2019s controlling and manipulative to him already, and he\u2019s internalized it as normal behaviour to be accommodated and accepted</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>his mom was really protective </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He\u2019s 25 years old. Also every mother should be \u201cprotective\u201d by default, so when people describe mothers as \u201cprotective,\u201d what they really mean is \u201coverprotective.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is not something a mother of a 25 year old man should be having trouble adjusting to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><del>I</del> his mother was <del>agitating her</del> snooping through your things on purpose and making <del>her</del> him think <del>I</del> you wouldn&#39;t be a good partner, when he [should have] wanted <del>her</del> you to have the opposite impression of <del>me</del> her!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fixed it.</p>\n</div>",

She doesn't do this in other people's houses so she knows she's intruding on private space and personal boundaries. The first consequence was that she didn't like what she found and it served her right. A further consequence of her behaviour is that the next several visits will not be at your house.

He is currently showing more concern for his mother's impression of op than OP's impression of his mother or himself. Which woman's feelings matter more to him in this situation? Because if he's more emotionally concerned about another woman that isn't you, op, then maybe he isn't ready for an adult relationship. Yes it's that serious. Marriage is vowing amongst other things to put your spouse before anyone else. There's no exception for overbearing mothers or boys having emotionally incestuous affairs (Google emotional incest) who allow their moms to become a third person in the relationship. \n\nYou see, op, this is the can of worms you can smell and don't like the look of. You need to dig in and get to the root of it before further comingling your lives and finances. He's probably hoping you'll just go along with pleasing his mother like he was raised to. He might need a bit of personal therapy to work out what healthy boundaries are. But he needs to understand that he can only have an intimate relationship with one person.",
