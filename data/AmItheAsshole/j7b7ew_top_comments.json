Also, since your mother is so manipulative you should contact your credit card provider and tell them you would like to go completely paperless so there are no statements or banking info sent to your mailbox. Let them know you have a situation where you feel your cc may be compromised if they send any mailings to you. If your cc company has an app, oftentimes you can toggle between turning your card on and off...and if so...you should definitely do that as well. I keep my banking and credit cards off until I am ready to make purchasesp and I turn it off after I see the charge reflected in the app.\nAlso, idk how it works in the UK but here in the US many cc companies allow you to change your cc number every so often. If its possible, that's also an option available to you. Check your statements in the app regularly and make sure you set up alerts. Also make sure there are no authorized users on your account. It may seem like overkill but your mom, bro and sil have already proven to be shady, manipulative with a willingness to be fraudulent. They've already proven they're fiscally irresponsible. I wouldn't put it past one of them to get ahold of a duplicate card or your cc number and go on a spree. CC aren't free money. I taught my girls and my adult students to view credit cards as the mobster or loans hark who'll break their egs if they don't pay him off. Changes the perspective doesn't it?\nAgain. NTA. Can't say the same for 3/4 of your family tho.\n\nKudos to your dad for having some common sense. Thank goodness you have him.",

I don\u2019t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I\u2019m at university. I do however pay my parents about \u00a3300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I\u2019m in my final year of uni so I\u2019ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. \n\nI also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it\u2019s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to \u00a3100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to \u00a380 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I\u2019ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.\n\nThe only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was \u201cfree money.\u201d I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can\u2019t Magic up that kind of money. \n\nThings went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.\n\nWhen I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they\u2019re all trying to take me for a ride and they\u2019re trying to manipulate me cos I\u2019m young and they think I\u2019m vulnerable.

Thankfully Dad has your back.  Give them nothing. Please excuse the caps, but I want it seen; OP, MAKE SURE YOU MONITOR YOUR CREDIT. IF MOM KNOWS YOUR INFORMATION SHE MAY ASSIST THEM IN OPENING OTHER FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTS.",

Legally the card company has to be jointly liable if the supplier fails to deliver, goes out of business etc. Anything you buy where you are not getting the product there and then you ALWAYS put on a credit card. Airline tickets, ordering furniture, buying a laptop online etc you always use a cc, so if that airline, furniture shop, computer shop goes out of business before delivering you just call the CC company and they refund your money. Years ago I worked for a retailer that went bust and saw people who had paid cash or cheque and lost their money. (I think they eventually got 5% back a year later) Those who'd paid by credit card just made a phone call. They are also useful if you get a sudden emergency that you can't afford, like your central heating blows up and it's the middle of the night and snowing outside, or your car breaks down and you need it for work etc. Having a credit card to pay even if it takes you several months to pay it back is better than freezing to death or losing your job.",

With debit cards, it\u2019s a direct access to your bank account, and funds can get depleted very quickly if you are not militant about keeping track of your balance. For debit card fraud, your liability is $50 if you notify the bank within two days. After two days, your liability increases to $500, so you could end up paying for costly purchases that you did not make. For credit cards, there are strict liability laws limiting credit card fraud liability for the consumer to $50. As long as you report the charge within 60 days, the credit card company is required to investigate. It is way easier to get your money back with a credit card than it is with a debit card unless you notice the fraudulent purchase pretty much immediately.\n\nOn top of that, credit cards frequently come with perks like travel points and other benefits. I absolutely hate it when I have to use cash these days because the point game is so lucrative. When I use cash, I feel like I am leaving money on the table.",

Then surprise surprise, everyone wasn't good for the money and everyone didn't pay the mortgage companies back, but they'd already sold those mortgages to other places, like hedge funds, or investing firms, or even Greece, the country.

I pay it off completely every month and I try to never have more owed on it than I have in my account at any one time.\n\nCredit cards can be very useful when you have expenses that are immediate, and income that is pending. But if you put a charge on that card for money you don't have, you better know where and when that money is coming. And you better know that you can live the next month on that money minus whatever debt you have on the card. Otherwise you trap yourself in the debt cycle.\n\nOP - Anyone who thinks credit cards are \"free money\" is a fucking idiot and anyone who tries to convince you they are is a fucking asshole.",
