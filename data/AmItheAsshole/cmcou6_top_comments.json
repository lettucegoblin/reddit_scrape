Generally speaking, grown adult men should be very cautious about touch teenage girls who they do not know. A lot of grown men try to prey on young teen girls and will cross boundaries knowing that these girls are the least likely women/females to stick up for themselves due to fear and inexperience. This is likely why the lady reacted so strongly. \n\nNext, he said he shook her shoulder, which is significantly more invasive than tapping. Just like in this thread, people say you should try hard to find another way to get a stranger's attention than touching. Tapping would have been much better than grabbing her shoulder (which is what shaking necessitates) and should generally be reserved for lifesaving situations. \n\nLastly, I did think people were overreacting a bit, but it was important for OP to learn that he should avoid touching young women in public. I think it's also important to note that I (almost) never see men touching other men like this in public. I think men tend to realize that touching a strange man to get his attention (or move past him) is an invasion of personal space and should be avoided. However, they usually aren't as considerate about invading strange women's personal space.",
