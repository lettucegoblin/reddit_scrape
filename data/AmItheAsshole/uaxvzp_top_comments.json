They allowed that boy to continue his harassment of your daughter and did nothing to stop it or discourage it. In fact they did the opposite of that by trying to force her to be harassed even more in the classroom and to be punished for saying NO to someone who was harassing her. I Would have the name and number of a lawyer on hand for them and also the contact info for the local news to show them you are not letting your daughter be a victim!! She has a right to say NO and for those around her to accept that !!",

By and large, teachers do care about their students; nobody is teaching for the great pay, trust me. Of course there are exceptions, but they are a vast minority. If you go in prepared to be hostile, what you say can get lost in how you say it.

Those make the school defensive and then you'll be an opposing party. They will start planning a legal defense instead of forming a partnership. They will know immediately what you're trying to accomplish, but you'll have forced their hand.

Bringing a known and respected member of the school is akin to going to a meeting with a union rep. It shows you're prepared, you have support, and that you've taken steps to make sure you're being objectively reasonable too.

I immediately stood up and left.  </p>\n\n<p>The teacher (also a perverted man) yelled at me - but I absolutely refused.  No amount of explaining made him understand, so I just walked out.  </p>\n\n<p>The lessons you are teaching her are the right ones.</p>\n</div>",

I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.\n\nMy daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. \n\nHe said no because the teacher had said \"about\" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that \"you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules\" and she said she didn't care. \n\nI heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.\n\nBut then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a call with her about it.

But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the \"Include everyone\" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say \"No\" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. \n\nThank you,\n\nOP\n\nShe emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal.

Use the words \"interfering with my daughter's right to an education\" and note that if the teacher forces your daughter to be in groups with this boy in class, she--and the school that employs her-- are *also* interfering in your daughter's right to an education. Ask why the teacher and principal felt they immediately needed to address a little girl saying \"no\" to her harasser but have yet to address the harassment itself. Ask why the girls involved are expected to bear the burden of \"getting along\" and \"being inclusive\" at the cost of their feeling safe and not being distracted from their education, but the boy has not been told to respect their boundaries. Ask what the school's policy is on bullying and sexual harassment and what they plan to do to ensure the girls in this class are able to concentrate on school without having their boundaries crossed. \n\nAlso, I very much agree with the person below who said to bring an attorney to the meeting with you (and follow their advice over the advice of anyone here!). My mom once had trouble getting the school to obey the law about disability accommodations for my sister. She got a lawyer and brought him to the meeting. He did not say a word other than introducing himself as her attorney. He did not need to. The school folded pretty much immediately just because a lawyer was there and they knew they were wrong and they knew the jig was up. The mother of a friend of mine whose brother also needed accommodations had a very similar experience at the same school. It does work. \n\nIf you can't afford a lawyer, there may be a legal aid organization or legal clinic that helps with education law issues or with gender discrimination issues--look around and see. But paying a lawyer just to show up to the meeting and back you up might be worth it in terms of avoiding future hassle from the school if you can (usually the initial consult would be free).",

I had spoken to her teacher about it and to the principal so that they could make whatever teachers that supervised recess aware. \n\nWithin a few weeks of those discussions, they held a Halloween \u201ccarnival\u201d in the evening with games and whatnot and the kids were encouraged to dress up. My daughter and one of her friends were getting hot so we went outside so they could cool off and play on the playground. \n\nY\u2019all, this little boy came running up and straight up jumped on her and tackled her to the ground as she was just standing there talking to her friend. I LOST MY SHIT. Of course his mother was nowhere to be found. After harassing my kid for weeks and then pulling that, I told him that he needed to stay the hell away from my kid and that if he laid hands on her again he would live to regret it. I told my daughter that she could avoid him and ignore him if he did try to interact with her and that he had no right to bother her or put his hands on her, and to let me know if any more incidents occurred because I was DONE after that. I also let her teacher know what happened and that i expected them to ensure her safety and comfort in that regard moving forward because it was clear that they either weren\u2019t addressing it or taking it seriously enough to ensure that the kid understood his behavior was unacceptable.\n\nAbout two weeks later I get an email from the teacher explaining that the boy had been trying to do group work with the group my kid was in and she told him \u201cmy mom said I don\u2019t have to talk to you and to just ignore you if you talked to me because of the way you treat me.\u201d and that it hurt his feelings and was not acceptable as sometimes they would have to work together since they were in the same class. \n\nI didn\u2019t even bother responding to her email and just called to set up a meeting with her and the principal in which I told them in no uncertain terms that it was bullshit that they weren\u2019t taking this seriously after several emails from me about his behavior and ESPECIALLY after what he did at the Halloween event, and that my daughter was 100% correct in telling him that. I told them that there was not a situation where forcing her to work with someone who had been harassing her and physically attacking her was acceptable, and they had damn well better not try to make that happen or my next call would be to the district and superintendent, and they needed to ensure that that boy stayed the hell away from her and quit harassing her or I\u2019d raise hell the likes of which they\u2019d never seen before. I don\u2019t like to be a Karen, but I tried to do it the nice way and they obviously didn\u2019t take it seriously, so mama bear came out.\n\nOP, You\u2019re teaching your daughter important lessons, don\u2019t let these people try to bully YOU and make you question your choices in trying to protect your child.

This boy is and has been making her uncomfortable by treating her to unwanted attention. He is not entitled to that attention and she has politely told him as much. By teaching her to include even the person that actively disrespects her autonomy and reasonable personal boundaries, you are teaching her that her safety is less meaningful than allowing this other child to do as they please with no regard for others. To my view, my daughter is not obligated to sacrifice her safety or well-being to build entitlement in another person. If you disagree, I would be interested to hear why.\" \n\nIf the teacher sticks to \"This is my classroom rule\" then you should point-blank ask if she has considered that her rule allows bullies and other poorly behaved students access to their victims without consequence or regard for the safety of the victim. \n\nBack when I was teaching, I had two students that come to mind that none of the other children wanted in their group.

If this goes above the workload that a single teaching can handle (and it sounds like it does), then they should take the students at their word that this boy is behaving in inappropriate ways that the students cannot handle on their own.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can tell, NTA.</p>\n</div>",

Despite all of that, she was able to just walk right out of the cafeteria with a boy that continually BULLIED her despite my complaints. </p>\n\n<p>They victim blamed her all year before this, despite her actions only being defending herself, because it was easier than deal with problematic behaviors in the other children, who were mostly non functional. They covered up the event, and I only found out when Police called me to schedule a physical exam at the Women&#39;s Center and interview her as well. </p>\n\n<p>When I went to the school, they once again tried to blame my daughter, saying she LURED the other boy into the bathroom. I was like THE FUCK YOU SAY?!??! and the changed their words. </p>\n\n<p>Sexual harassment is something schools do NOT care about, unless you get an attorney involved. </p>\n\n<p>I wish the homeschooling environment that exists now was present years ago when my kids were in school, I&#39;d have yanked them out so fast the office workers heads would have spun.</p>\n</div>",
