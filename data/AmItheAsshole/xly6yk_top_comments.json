This is your hill to die on moment. Fianc\u00e9 needs an ultimatum or you need to just walk away completely.  I am very sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. However it\u2019s better to know all this now before you\u2019re married with kids! \n\nMy husband \u201cswitched\u201d out my wedding dress but because I chose a nice second choice that was financially a better option for our budget (we paid for the wedding except my parents paid for the cake and in laws paid for some expensive wine/drinks). When he found out my dream dress wasn\u2019t what I bought, he went with my best friend to the bridal shop and arranged to get the dream dress regardless of cost! It wasn\u2019t much, about $500 difference but the fact he did this to make sure I had my dream dress showed me his feelings and respect. No I didn\u2019t make a stink about it. He spoke with my mom to see how dress shopping went and found out. I would have been happy in the second choice dress as it was beautiful as well. \n\nUnfortunately, this wedding is turning into your fianc\u00e9 and his mother\u2019s \u201cwedding\u201d.

It will cause strain on your relationship with fianc\u00e9 as he\u2019s already taking MIL side and not even considering yours or your feelings. Switching out the dresses behind your back is a huge show of disrespect and clearly what his mother wanted. </p>\n\n<p>This your and your fianc\u00e9s wedding so it should follow your \u201cvision\u201d not his mother\u2019s. This is your hill to die on moment. Fianc\u00e9 needs an ultimatum or you need to just walk away completely.  I am very sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. However it\u2019s better to know all this now before you\u2019re married with kids! </p>\n\n<p>My husband \u201cswitched\u201d out my wedding dress but because I chose a nice second choice that was financially a better option for our budget (we paid for the wedding except my parents paid for the cake and in laws paid for some expensive wine/drinks). When he found out my dream dress wasn\u2019t what I bought, he went with my best friend to the bridal shop and arranged to get the dream dress regardless of cost! It wasn\u2019t much, about $500 difference but the fact he did this to make sure I had my dream dress showed me his feelings and respect. No I didn\u2019t make a stink about it. He spoke with my mom to see how dress shopping went and found out. I would have been happy in the second choice dress as it was beautiful as well. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this wedding is turning into your fianc\u00e9 and his mother\u2019s \u201cwedding\u201d. Do what is best for you mentally and emotionally.</p>\n</div>",

Telling you what you can and cannot do, once you're pregnant, so that you \"don't hurt the baby\"? She'll be at every doctor appointment and basically attached to your hip with super glue.

The absolute best thing you can do right now is end this IMMEDIATELY, run like your life depends on it (because quite frankly...it does!) and never, EVER look back!

Telling you what you can and cannot do, once you&#39;re pregnant, so that you &quot;don&#39;t hurt the baby&quot;? She&#39;ll be at every doctor appointment and basically attached to your hip with super glue. Forget choosing your nursery colors and theme/decor! She&#39;ll treat you as nothing but a living, walking, breathing incubator. Hell...what happens if she decides that you MUST have a certain gender and your pregnancy results in the opposite gender? Because I absolutely do NOT see her as one who&#39;d be reasonable and understand that it isn&#39;t as easy as grabbing your preferred gender off a shelf at Target and heading to the checkout!</p>\n\n<p>You will literally become whatever SHE wants you to be. Every minutiae of your life will be a decision SHE makes for you. The more I think about your life, the more enraged I get and the more disgusted I become with your fianc\u00e9 and his mother! The absolute best thing you can do right now is end this IMMEDIATELY, run like your life depends on it (because quite frankly...it does!) and never, EVER look back! And once they&#39;re no longer in your rearview mirror I&#39;d get into counseling because this relationship has likely done some damage or traumatized you in ways you don&#39;t even realize right now. You deserve to live a happy, healthy, fulfilled life that YOU have chosen \ud83d\udda4 Best of luck to you!!</p>\n</div>",

I lost it was sobbing. She got in a huge fight my mom when my mom made it leave. She called me a brat and ungrateful because she was going above and beyond for me. Anyway, when I was about 7? She brought over this creepy ass vintage clown doll for me. The thing was so scary, I hated it. My dad bent over backwards for her so insisted that it go in my room. My mom eventually tossed it in the closet later that day so I didn\u2019t have to look at it. I still had nightmares that night, the next morning my brother and I came up with a plan to get rid of it. He tossed it in a pillow case we took it into the backyard never to be seen again. Well next time evil grandma came over she was asking about the clown. She wanted to see my room. Eventually it came out we got rid of it. She flipped out! My mom kicked her out for berating her kids.
