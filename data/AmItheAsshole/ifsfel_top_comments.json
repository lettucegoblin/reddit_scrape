I took a class that ended up requiring social media and had to go to the dean for special dispensation to not make the one profile i had left public. She constantly harassed me via anonymous text and email sending me into depression and anorexia. She put Craigslist ads out with my actual address and I had these huge military guys showing up for dates and \"favors\". She threatened to kill herself. She showed up at our work and houses. Signed me up for tons of offensive spam mail. She had photo albums of everything; including one devoted just to my car. The list goes on honestly. All of this to illustrate: I never once got the police to care. Until they break in or try to physically hurt you they won't help.\n\nI'm so sorry for what you are going through.

They all met when I was in kindergarten and that was where she met my dad. Like I said, her obsession with him went up and down all those years, along with her mental health. Eventually she contacted my paternal grandmother and asked her something along the lines of if my mom died if maybe she and my dad could get together. My dad had kept it secret from most people that she was stalking him, he thought it was kinda embarrassing and also out of respect for her husband and daughter. But at this point he had to come clean about the extent of it. And so I went and found some information about stalkers. \nWhat I learned is that there is multiple kinds of stalkers, the woman that stalked my dad was the \u201cyou love me but you just don\u2019t realize kind\u201d. I don\u2019t know if your stalker is this kind but there resources you can contact to get help with this. \nI learned that the best way to deal with this kind of stalker was to cut all contact. But not just for my dad to cut all contact, the whole family. If my dad cut contact but I, for example, kept up contact she would see that as a way in, as a way to get info on my dad etc etc and continue. So we all cut contact, blocked her on Facebook etc. and it seems to have worked, there hasn\u2019t been any issues for a few years now. We live in the same city and my dad has run into her once (technically twice but he hid lol) but nothing that seem premeditated like before when she\u2019s drive by our house or show up where she knew he worked. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that she\u2019ll start escalating but if she\u2019s one of the ones that do, it\u2019s much better and easier to nip it in the bud than let it fester. Cut contact and if possible, have people close to you cut contact too. And contact the resources you have in your country and find the best way for you to move forward without her escalating her antics \n\nI hope everything works out for you, OP!",

It didn't surprise me at all when you said Jane was badgering her friend to set up the date - they will try any avenue they can find to get to their target.

You should explain to them clearly what she's already done and how you're afraid it's going to turn physical and/or that she may start saying shot about you and so you need to start a paper trail NOW so that if that happens, you've already established a history of her stalking you.\n\nThis is SO IMPORTANT. Oftentimes first offences/first reported behavior are minimized and/or given leniency because courts/police like to give people the benefit of the doubt. I have multiple friends who tried to report scary stalkers but waited until it DID start to get physical and the police kinda disregarded it as to them, this was just starting. They were dismissive of the prior concerns and evidence.\n\nOn that note, it's also very important, if you haven't done it already, to make it clear to her that you want no more contact and then STICK WITH IT. That means saying in plain English \"I do not want a relationship with you. All communications from you are unwanted and will be ignored\" and then sticking to that. Never respond to her again. Again, police/courts want to see proof that you made direct communications with the person demanding they leave you alone and then no longer engage with them. I had a friend have a request for a RO thrown out because she continued to communicate with the guy. It didn't matter that her communication was to ask him to stop. In the judge's eyes, her talking to him at all meant she was willing to engage and thus negated the need for the RO.\n\nIf you can, you should do this.

But that civil court could determine more because it was in violation of the law, they just don\u2019t deal with landlord/tenant shit. Basically, my partner and I would come home to it being pitch black when we knew we left the lamp on in our room, she made remarks to me about how I \u201cshould do the dishes more considering I\u2019m immunocompromised\u201d but literally 1) how the fuck does she know what my sink looks like. 2) how the fuck does she know I\u2019m immunocompromised without seeing the meds on my bedside table and under my sink. \nWe installed the wyze camera and literally within 1 minute of us driving off we see her scurry into our apartment in her pajamas to snoop in our bedroom/bathroom/kitchen. Talk about making you feel violated. \n\nStill once we told her we knew she\u2019d been down there and we would go to court, no more visits. We had days of footage by them too to establish a pattern.",

Cops said they didn\u2019t have enough to file for trespassing because she didn\u2019t \u201cbreak and enter\u201d. But that civil court could determine more because it was in violation of the law, they just don\u2019t deal with landlord/tenant shit. Basically, my partner and I would come home to it being pitch black when we knew we left the lamp on in our room, she made remarks to me about how I \u201cshould do the dishes more considering I\u2019m immunocompromised\u201d but literally 1) how the fuck does she know what my sink looks like. 2) how the fuck does she know I\u2019m immunocompromised without seeing the meds on my bedside table and under my sink. \nWe installed the wyze camera and literally within 1 minute of us driving off we see her scurry into our apartment in her pajamas to snoop in our bedroom/bathroom/kitchen. Talk about making you feel violated. </p>\n\n<p>Still once we told her we knew she\u2019d been down there and we would go to court, no more visits.
