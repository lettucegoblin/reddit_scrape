I was struck (again) by the fact that your social circle is small and seems to have been your husband's social circle first. Your friends are the '10-15 friends of his', your children go to his sister's (who lives next door), his friends have all noticed that he seemed to have had feelings for his friend but don't think you should have ever said anything (even though it turns out you were right). Do you have an therapist that you see individually, who has no connection to the one you see with your husband? How are you treating your depression? Do you have friends and a support system separate from your husbands, who you can speak to candidly, who would prioritise YOU first? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou diminish the fact that what your husband was doing when you finally spoke to him after *three years* was gaslighting, even though he himself said it was. In your original post, you say his friends don't realise the extent to which he is absent in the home. They seem very close, and if you are your friends as well, did you not feel able to confide in them? You were grieving for this friend as well, weren't you? And you still had to deal with the trauma of your upbringing, childcare for two small children who couldn't understand why their father wouldn't play with them and housework, while working 80 hours a week in a stressful job, while your husband basically wasn't there but you still dealt with the pain of him not 'being there' all these years. It's commendable that you were capable of that, but you can be sad and angry about that time, about the fact that you needed to be that capable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou seem happy that the situation is 'fixed', but I am sure there will be times when you want to revisit this issue, as your feelings change, and you should be able to without feeling guilty that you're dredging up the past. What I'm trying to say is that the matter isn't closed, and I get the feeling that you're either numb, or relieved, or that this is such an improvement from the past that it feels, idk, like victory? I read a comment from someone saying that because he loved someone else, it doesn't mean he doesn't love you. I agree in theory, but I respectfully have to disagree for your situation. He might have still loved you, but he was treating you badly. He turned down the option of therapy, he gaslit you when you tried to gently broach the subject and he let you struggle alone for three years. That's not something you need to diminish, even as you acknowledge his grief and confusion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry, I feel like I'm raining on your parade, because things are getting better, but I feel very sad for you and this situation that didn't need to be as painful as it has been. I'm not sure I've said what I feel in the best way. Wish you the best.",

Basically, from her explanation, Pan is someone who does not recognize gender in attraction; it's more of a who the person is, not what they are.  \n\nAnd keep in mind, he didn't act on his feelings because of his love for you and the kids.

Most of us don't ever get those kind of people in our lives, so I hope you harbor no ill will toward him.  I don't know you and your family, but I feel such love for all of you after reading your posts.  \n\nAnd who knows, maybe there is 1 person out there in this world who read your posts and it helped them with something they were going through.  I mean, because of your posts I was able to have another heartfelt convo with my daughter about her being Pan.  Just not something you usually bring up at random, and I want her to know I accept her for whatever she is, short of being a serial killer.  (She's too lazy to hide bodies and I'm too old lol)",

It's been almost two months, so my husband and I did have a lot of free time to discuss all of this, especially during lockdown. I'll try to make it short. \n\nMy husband still doesn't specifically identify as bisexual. B was the one and only man he's ever had feelings for. He's said that apart from B he really would not picture himself with a man, this despite being able to picture himself with B. Some people may be skeptical about my husband's conclusions on his sexuality, but his identity is his own to define and this is the one thing I will respect for sure. Also, trust me, bi-erasure is the last thing I'd want to encourage. We already read up a lot on the different labels recently (on top of what we already know), we know bisexuality doesn't imply an even sexual attraction to both men and women, etc. He just doesn't identify as bi as of now and that's okay. \n\nAbout him falling in love while being married to me - it hurts, yes. I cried about it, yes. I know many are concerned with how I seem to neglect my own feelings, but I can assure you I won't deny those despite being a bit awkward about emotions. Obviously, in a perfect world (by my own terms), my husband would only have eyes for me. But I know my husband still loves me very deeply, and while he did me wrong these last few years, he's also a very honest man who would've openly tried to make it right by everyone had B not died. Let's say that in some other dimension, he would've wanted to end up with B - he would've told me, despite how hurtful it could've been. Maybe there would've been drama, tears, and all, yeah. \n\nBut B died. And B and I are the only ones my husband is truly in love with. We both know that. There's no way to bring B back and come up with what would've been best for all three of us. So we're staying married, simply because we do love each other as husband and wife, and because our little family is the most amazing cocoon we ever built. I have no hard feelings when life gets in the way like that.     \nI know it sounds like a very simple way to see things, but that's how I think. And I'm plenty happy. I don't want to get a divorce, he doesn't want to - why should we then? \n\n(*Also, I know people have varying definitions of love. A few years ago, had someone told me \"it's so hard being in love with two people at once\", I would've snorted or frowned, probably haha. I totally understand if some end up saying they aren't convinced by our sentiment!*).",

        "body": "Not OP, but I thought I'd offer my two cents since OP has undergone so much in the past month and might not have finished processing everything. Maybe my story will help OP too. \n\nI think one of the most normalized but harmful ideas in our society is the idea that you can only truly love one person at a time, or that loving more than one person at a time reduces the love each person gets. So often, finding out that your partner has feelings for someone else is absolutely crushing, and a lot of times it ends the relationship. Im bisexual, and met and married my husband in the US military, when Don't Ask Don't Tell was in effect. If anyone's unfamiliar, it was a policy that you couldn't be openly gay (any form of LGBTQ) in the military. If you told someone, you could be discharged. But no one could directly ask you if you were gay, either. So a lot of people like me either completely separated their work and home lives and didn't talk about their personal lives AT ALL or suppressed all gay inclinations. This meant that I didn't consider being in a serious relationship with a woman, and I felt cheated out of exploring that side of me in a serious way. \n\nI eventually explained all of this to my husband and he agreed to explore a poly relationship with me. I was free to pursue a relationship with a woman, and the only rule was that I'd never leave my husband for her. If I ever considered it, or if someone asked me to leave, I'd end it immediately. What I realized is that humans are capable of infinite amounts of love. It's not a pie, where dividing it into more peices reduces everyone's share. Your heart just expands to accommodate more people. So while I love the woman I'm with, it doesn't reduce my love for my husband. They're just different relationships. This realization allowed us to expand our relationship to include him dating as well, and neither of us gets jealous. \n\nLong story short, OP, the fact that he fell in love with someone else doesn't change his feelings for you. He loved you both. Neither of you threatened the other, even if he had realized it while B was alive. This is such a brutally heartwrenching story, and I'm so overjoyed to see it resolving in a positive way. You're both getting to a healthy place. But, it can be devastating to find out that your partner loved/loves someone else. So, in case the thought ever sneaks up, I can assure you that it's entirely possible, and even is very probable, for him to have had feelings for B without it reducing his love for you. The fact that you stuck together through such a long and devastating time proves that.\n\nETA: I don't mean to try to persuade anyone to be poly. It's not for everyone and there's nothing wrong with monogamy. Rather, I wanted to explain from my own experience that it's possible to love more than one person romantically. So, in the event that your monogamous partner cheats, maybe you can have some small degree of comfort knowing that it's entirely possible that they never stopped loving you. It doesn't fix their betrayal by a long shot, nor does it excuse their actions, but it might help your mental health afterwards.",

        "body": "Yep!  That can absolutely be an indicator of depression.\n\nI'd recommend a few things:\n\n- 5 Second Rule:  When the thought crosses your mind to get up and do something, get up *immediately*, because within 5 seconds you'll start coming up with justifications for not doing it, doing it later, etc.\n\n- 10 Minutes: Just promise yourself you'll exercise for 10 minutes.  It doesn't matter if you used to do 4 hour bike rides.  The big commitment can be too overwhelming to summon the willpower to do.  So just commit to doing a little something - even a walk around the block.  If you can do that most days, it will help.  And if you happen to be enjoying that 10 minutes and want to keep going, that's fine.  You may find yourself getting a nice endorphin boost.  And if you stop after 10 minutes, that's perfectly fine.  Congratulate yourself on doing what you promised yourself!\n\n- Try journaling.  Recognizing your thoughts and getting them out of your head can be the key for many people.\n\n- Find a therapist and talk.  It's amazing how much it helps just being able to verbalize what's really going on without having to be diplomatic or worry about fallout of saying it to someone in your daily life.\n\n- If all that doesn't help, or you can't get yourself to actually call a therapist or start working out again, call your physician and ask about a low dose anti depressant.  Depression becomes a chemical state in the brain, and sometimes you need help reversing the chemical cycle so you get back to being you.  It won't be a miracle pill overnight, but can make you feel a bit lighter pretty quickly, and over time you'll likely find yourself starting to do more and get back to your old routines more.\n\nIt's easier to treat depression early on when it's milder than after years of being stuck in the rut.\n\nGood luck!",

The whole reason he didn\u2019t talk about this until his family was at breaking point is because he was afraid his wife would respond like you guys. The reason there\u2019s a positive future for them all is because she responded in a compassionate, understanding way that accepts that human emotions are messy and don\u2019t always abide by the rules we think they should. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible for someone to fall in love with more than one person \u2013 very likely he loved entirely different things about each of them. Personally I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous to expect one other human being to be able to fulfil every single thing we need from a companion for life. But aside from that, it seems pretty clear to me he was devoted to his family, hence repressing this feeling to the point that he didn\u2019t even realise it till it was impossible to act on it, and still told no-one about it even while it took a spectacular toll on his mental health.\n\nAt the end of the day, what\u2019s the benefit of thinking like you\u2019re saying, being suspicious rather than trusting and understanding? Say she responds like that, decides she can never trust him again; she loses her husband, the children lose a huge part of their relationship with their father, and he loses his parents, his best friend, and his wife and children within a few years. That leaves everyone fucking miserable and lonely, all for the sake of feelings he couldn\u2019t help having and never acted on? I think we\u2019d all be a hell of a lot happier if we channeled OP\u2019s level of compassion.",

The reason there\u2019s a positive future for them all is because she responded in a compassionate, understanding way that accepts that human emotions are messy and don\u2019t always abide by the rules we think they should. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s entirely possible for someone to fall in love with more than one person \u2013 very likely he loved entirely different things about each of them. Personally I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous to expect one other human being to be able to fulfil every single thing we need from a companion for life. But aside from that, it seems pretty clear to me he was devoted to his family, hence repressing this feeling to the point that he didn\u2019t even realise it till it was impossible to act on it, and still told no-one about it even while it took a spectacular toll on his mental health.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, what\u2019s the benefit of thinking like you\u2019re saying, being suspicious rather than trusting and understanding? Say she responds like that, decides she can never trust him again; she loses her husband, the children lose a huge part of their relationship with their father, and he loses his parents, his best friend, and his wife and children within a few years. That leaves everyone fucking miserable and lonely, all for the sake of feelings he couldn\u2019t help having and never acted on? I think we\u2019d all be a hell of a lot happier if we channeled OP\u2019s level of compassion.</p>\n</div>",
