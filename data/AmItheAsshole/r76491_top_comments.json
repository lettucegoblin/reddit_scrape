Treating you like he owns you, casually telling you that you will be dropping everything and serving his giant family for 5 days while heavily pregnant. Treating you like your feelings don't matter and you don't get a say in your own life. Going on and on about his \"authority\". And demanding a written apology? That's some patronizing shit. What does he want you to write? \"Sorry for not respecting your god-given right to treat me with disrespect. I fucked up and forgot I'm not a person, just your wife. I exist merely to obey.\"\n\nI'd sit his ass down and tell him that I don't know if it's grief or what, but he needs to get his head right, because this is not going to be how our marriage works. This is not what you signed up for. Maybe his mom was fine with her subsevience in her marriage, but you're not his mom and he's not his dad. It's 2021. He looks ridiculous ordering you around, acting like a big man. Plus, come on, you don't get to act like you're sooooo into \"traditional\" marriage when your wife is out working full time. Dude needs a reality check and some grief counseling.",

This is such a red flag OP and I urge you that while you are still earlier in pregnancy and not on maternity leave you reach out to your obgyn/midwife and workplace to access support as often there are all kinds of extra things that can be done to help you leave an abusive situation while pregnant that are less available once a baby is born.\n\nAnd make no mistake this is textbook emotional and financial abuse. Your husband is testing the waters for making you quit work to become his full time worker to uphold his head of the family bullshit by locking you down post partum without work (he\u2019s already pushing for your mat leave to be salami sliced so you end up quitting) and being unable to get out.\n\nHe overplayed his hand here and tipped you off that his way of being head of the family is more a dictatorship than anything like being a father figure. And you will do all the work, cop all the crap and he will take all credit and give your own kids nothing except the same.\n\nThe clue is the written apology. That is something children are asked to do in certain circumstances to help them understand why a behaviour was hurtful or why sometimes they have to \u2018pass themselves\u2019 by learning etiquette or rules. It is a way to discipline not punish if employed correctly by a parent. But you are not a child and he is not your parent. But he is infantilising you, asserting a dictatorial attitude and mobilising the whole extended family to do the same. If this is the way he treats you a literal adult and equal, it will only get worse for you and it makes me really concerned for your kids.\n\nMy dad used to make me write written apologies and essays on my behaviour as a kid. He once took me to the cinema (he did not pay for it) and I disagreed with his opinion on the film. He was very certain it was a terrible film because it did not reference X in a respectful way, failed to pick up Y and Z was not up to scratch. I said \u2018well I don\u2019t know about any of that but I just really enjoyed it so to me it was a good movie.\u2019 I was 7 and it was a kids\u2019 film designed to be watched for entertainment over summer holidays by kids without boring the parents. Not a classic sure but a solid decent kids\u2019 movie. Which I as a kid enjoyed but daddy as an adult was annoyed because it failed on some cinematic trend like the tension in the Battleship Potemkin. Dude, I\u2019m 7, there was a talking mouse! Chill your boots.\n\nSo I had to write an essay to prove my point. If I did not like a meal he cooked I had to write apologies and a critique to defend my point (I felt the taste of bell peppers was too strong compared to the rice but I must be grateful that you cook for me.) Same with books or if I said stuff in company.\n\nSure I grew up to be a professional writer because of it. But I also grew up anorexic, crippled with self loathing, totally terrified to ever express a need or want without guilt, yet also opinionated to the point of not being able to have a preference without sounding aggressive because I was so used to always being defensive and having the joy sucked out of anything to the point I just hated my childhood and rebelled, self sabotaged and ended up good at stuff but stuck. My written word was used against me like a court of law but if I refused then there would be other consequences like physical or financial abuse, with holding food or force feeding. \n\nMy mum enabled this and joined in. It is one of the most harmful dehumanising ways to destroy a person. Of all the shit my parents did it is the hardest to overcome despite non contact and therapy. My parents divorced and my dad didn\u2019t take a single family photo but he kept all my \u2018apologies\u2019 and would quote them at me. Literally when I was studying aged 23 and he did not approve he quoted a thing I wrote when I was 11 to prove his point. Nothing says authoriative than quoting the words of someone you bullied and abused into writing it down.\n\nThis is not a safe situation. Once someone crosses to this \u2018written apology\u2019 shit they see nothing about escalating to the other \u2018because I say\u2019 abuse like cleaning the floor with a toothbrush or checking your mileometer.

He doesn't respect her income because she is going to be funding this 5 day party. He doesn't respect her time and energy as I can tell he would do nothing. And he definitely doesn't respect her feelings because he didn't ask her for them at any stage of this and instead told her she hurt his feelings.\n\nON TOP OF THAT HE DOESN'T RESPECT THE FAMILY INCOME CUZ HE ASKED HER TO TAKE OFF WORK TO HOST HIS FAMILY LIKE WTF?

Tell them you don't understand where they think you are going to get the money from, you feel tired and need more sleep before work.  If they act all outraged order happy meals for them and hand them out saying this is for your audacity.  Then if it is your day off tell SO you are going back to sleep because you are exhausted being heavily pregnant.",

Heck, we recently offered to have hubby's family over for lunch / dinner on Christmas Day (8 adults, 6 kids) because the new landscaping and temporary pool should be finished by then, and I'm in a bit of a tizzy figuring out cleaning and tidying, food etc on top of playing with the digger and building retaining walls.

So he was picking that she&#39;d do all that over the couple of days that they all started arriving.  Oh, and I bet she&#39;s meant to cover all the costs for the additional food etc as well, since she&#39;s the one making most of their money.   Well, no, he hadn&#39;t thought that far - it sounds like he&#39;s ignorant enough that it never even occurred to him that such things take a LOT of prior preparation and OP can&#39;t just magically make it all happen with a click of her fingers and a gracious hosts smile.</p>\n\n<p>Hell, even if she was <em>thrilled</em> with the idea of having them all for Christmas, trying to achieve everything needed in 3 weeks whilst also working, looking after a toddler and 6/7 months pregnant would be a massive stress.  Heck, we recently offered to have hubby&#39;s family over for lunch / dinner on Christmas Day (8 adults, 6 kids) because the new landscaping and temporary pool should be finished by then, and I&#39;m in a bit of a tizzy figuring out cleaning and tidying, food etc on top of playing with the digger and building retaining walls.  That&#39;s only ... (checks calendar) 3 weeks away ... <strong>OH SHITE!!!</strong> What have I done!!!  \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31  At least my boy is a tween and I&#39;m not pregnant, but I&#39;m seriously regretting offering right at this moment.</p>\n</div>",
