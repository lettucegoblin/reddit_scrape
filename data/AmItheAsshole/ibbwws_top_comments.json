He is blaming it on it being stripper money, he might not even realize the real reason he's upset. \n\nI went through this with my bf at the time when I was buying/selling a home because I wanted to move closer to my parents. We briefly discussed moving in together and he wanted his name to be on it, which I wasn't OK with (I was rolling a ton of equity) and he didn't have the credit to purchase a cardboard box. Things got uglier as he was clearly insecure about me being in a better place financially, professionally, etc. He started accusing me of cheating (I was not) and was generally miserable about all of it and then it became clear it was all about not putting his name on my house. It wasn't even my choice, his credit was awful and I'd never get a mortgage with him on it. We broke up before I had even sold my old house.",

It bothered me that he didn't see the problem with frequenting a business while judging the staff as trashy just for working at the business he was supporting. (If you disagree with something, don't support it).\n\nThen my brother up and met a girl at Hooters. And he married her. And much to my parents chagrin, she kept working at Hooters. Not only did my brother not mind, he supported her, and gave the what-for to anyone that complained or said inappropriate things about it. He had no patience for disrespect of his wife and he was clearly not ashamed of her or her job. He has also said he wouldn't have a problem with one of their daughters some day working there. He said this after their daughters were born, not just when they were hypothetical.\n\nYour boyfriend wants to go to strip clubs, and pay money to support a business that he ultimately is ashamed his girlfriend  made money in. That is extremely illogical. Either, the stripping is something to be ashamed of and he wants no part of it (either going to clubs or dating a woman who did that and doesn't regret it), OR he is okay with the industry, and it isn't a problem. He doesn't get to have it both ways.

But why would you risk financial and housing security for your baby for a man that may or may not screw you over? For a man that has no respect for your past, your success, and you in general? \n\nYou shouldn't second guess yourself. You are right to be concerned. You were right to ask strangers on the internet because your sister is an asshole. She clearly wants to scrub away your stripper past to.\n\nYou love you flat. You can grow in that flat. It has child care. It's near a school. If he actually cared about you and your baby he would not be asking you to risk everything you've worked for to placate his ego. He wants to control you and your finances by getting a joint house. He feels emasculated that his name isn't on the deed because he knows he has nothing if you break up. But he could get half the house if you get a new one together. \n\nHe sounds like a sexist asshole. He goes to strip clubs when he doesn't have a stable income, and continues to bring up his disgust in you for being a stripper. Let's unpack that. He goes to a place where you used to work and sexually objectifies women you probably knew and cared about. Then when he's mad he throws you being a stripper in your face. He isn't supporting sex workers. He's demeaning them. \n\nIt doesn't matter if he apologizes for saying mean things to you when you fight if he means them. and it's clear he means them when he does it every fight. He is telling you how he feels and you are letting him treat you poorly. Sometimes it's hard to tell when you're in an abusive relationship, but from experience this is at least the beginning of one. He is emotionally abusing you. He is gaslighting you by telling you you're too emotional to make a decision about not selling your flat, because he doesn't like your decision. He wants you to second guess yourself. He has been bringing your confidence down in yourself slowly until you may actually give in and sell your flat for a man with no job. Because let's be real, a start up is not a real job. If it picks up, great. But right now, can he help buy diapers? Formula? Baby clothes, maternity clothes. Can he help pay for child care or medical expenses? No? THEN DONT PUT YOURSELF INTO DEBT FOR HIM. Especially when you're about to give birth to the most expensive thing you will ever have. \n\nIf he loves you and this baby and wants to be a part of your lives, he will. If he doesn't want to move into your flat, that's his loss, not yours. Just because you're gonna have a baby doesn't mean it has to be all or nothing right now. It seems like he's someone I wouldn't want around my kid tbh, and someone I'm surprised you want around yours. Your kid will hear the bad things he says to you and it will effect them. It's more than giving your kid a dad, it's about giving them a loving home. And sometimes that's better done as a single parent.",

Nope. </p>\n\n<p>If he wants to live together, then he needs to come up with a plan for that which doesn&#39;t rely on him spending your money. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if you give in and do this. You will resent him. Forever, and that will become a toxic, awful environment for the kid. If he&#39;s not comfortable living in your flat, then keep your current arrangement, even after the baby comes. You can live apart, but be together. People have all sorts of arrangements that work for them. </p>\n\n<p>If he won&#39;t consider anything else, then ditch him. I know you don&#39;t want to do this alone, but from the sounds of it, the alternatives, with this dude, sound awful and will leave you stripped (pardon the pun) financially with deep, deep scars from his abusive behaviour.</p>\n</div>",

You make good money, we can\u2019t afford this new house otherwise\u201d) while he stays home \u201cworking on his start up\u201d (spoiler alert: the start up is always on the verge of launching but never does) & establishing himself as a \u201cstay at home dad\u201d. \n\nOnly he\u2019s not the kind of stay at home parent that takes care of the household or gives the kid attention, because he has iMpOrTaNt work to do with his start up. He\u2019s the kind that leaves the kid in dirty diapers because he\u2019s too busy texting with \u201cbusiness contacts\u201d he met at your old strip club. Maybe he\u2019s meeting up with Syndie or Kieraley for lunch while your off working. You come home exhausted, your child is crying and in a soiled nappy & it looks like a tornado went through your house, which is weird because you\u2019re 99% sure your kid has been in his bouncer since that morning. There\u2019s no dinner or groceries, so you order take-out even though you can\u2019t really afford it. Money is always tight, which doesn\u2019t make sense because you make good money - but one of these days you\u2019ll get a block of time to look over the finances. \n\nMeanwhile you take it one day at a time. Breathe. Try not to feel down when he makes comments on how your body/personality/outlook changed by having HIS child. Try not to let the barbs about being a former stripper get under your skin. And you\u2019re strong AF, you sacrificed and lived on ramen to build yourself a safety net ffs, so you manage. \n\nAt some point you realize very little business is occurring at his overnight business trips (that you\u2019re paying for) with Kieraley. He of course denies everything, but the trickles of truth keep slipping in. Once he can no longer deny it, it becomes your fault - for being away (supporting him) for getting fat (that stubborn post pregnancy 10 pounds) for not being carefree and fun like Keireley - which you had no choice in, because someone has to be the adult & take care of the kid. \n\nmaybe he leaves, maybe you kick him out - only now you realize how well he\u2019s taken care of himself. Half your house, and as the stay at home parent, support. You\u2019re broke too. While you thought you were working and saving for your future, he bought gaming computers and sexy get-always with Randos he met online. You move back to a studio flat, trying to scrape by while paying him - well really Kieraley who moved in hours after you left - to parent badly. \n\nWhy do I think this fanfic represents your future? Because you see it time after time on any of Reddit\u2019s unhappy mom subs. Check out breakingmom, femaledatingadvice, brokenmom, justNOso, or any of the dozens of subs where women vent about their exes. A LOT of these stories start like your, and most end like this.
