She has allowed the creation and escalation of a toxic situation where you are at least emotionally if not physically unsafe.  \n\n\"Punishing her harder\" in reference to your step sister worries me as well. Don't get me wrong, she is an AH for her behavior. But I suspect it has been created by your mom and step dad. She destroys people's property when she is angry (that will get her putin jail when she's older fyi) and your parents have flexible punishments depending on how many consequences THEY suffer. That isn't healthy nor a good way to parent.   \n\n\nYou may at some point want to show your mom this thread. I see it happen all the time on here. If she ever reads this.   \n\n\nMadam, you have chosen your new husband and your step children over your daughter, time and time again. From disregarding your daughters grieving process in regards to her father's death, allowing her to be raised in an unhealthy gender roll dominated environment (two kids splitting a smaller room then a single child because he pees standing up?) And made no effort to make where you live feel like a home to her (She is locked out of her own room.) Not only do you deserve being shunned, a family member should rent a billboard detailing what you have done so your entire community knows. You've allowed your step children to abuse your daughter. You have neglected her, and if not encouraged then at least looked the other way while your new husband marginalized her.  You shunned her in deed and action long before her Uncle pulled up to your house to rescue the child who didn't fit into your family family.  \n\n\nLive your best life u/Victorious-4433 And don't worry about your mom. Some day you might decide to forgive her, you might not. Not subjecting yourself to the abuse of her household however doesn't mean you love her less. It just means you love yourself more.  And there is nothing wrong with that.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You are not the AH. The fact your family told your mom not to come visit answers your question. She has allowed the creation and escalation of a toxic situation where you are at least emotionally if not physically unsafe.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Punishing her harder&quot; in reference to your step sister worries me as well. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she is an AH for her behavior. But I suspect it has been created by your mom and step dad. She destroys people&#39;s property when she is angry (that will get her putin jail when she&#39;s older fyi) and your parents have flexible punishments depending on how many consequences THEY suffer. That isn&#39;t healthy nor a good way to parent.   </p>\n\n<p>You may at some point want to show your mom this thread. I see it happen all the time on here. If she ever reads this.   </p>\n\n<p>Madam, you have chosen your new husband and your step children over your daughter, time and time again. From disregarding your daughters grieving process in regards to her father&#39;s death, allowing her to be raised in an unhealthy gender roll dominated environment (two kids splitting a smaller room then a single child because he pees standing up?) And made no effort to make where you live feel like a home to her (She is locked out of her own room.) Not only do you deserve being shunned, a family member should rent a billboard detailing what you have done so your entire community knows. You&#39;ve allowed your step children to abuse your daughter. You have neglected her, and if not encouraged then at least looked the other way while your new husband marginalized her.  You shunned her in deed and action long before her Uncle pulled up to your house to rescue the child who didn&#39;t fit into your family family.  </p>\n\n<p>Live your best life <a href=\"/u/Victorious-4433\">u/Victorious-4433</a> And don&#39;t worry about your mom. Some day you might decide to forgive her, you might not. Not subjecting yourself to the abuse of her household however doesn&#39;t mean you love her less. It just means you love yourself more.  And there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</div>",

If you have each in a separate bedroom but only one bathroom, that also works out okay.

        "body": "Not quite the same but it reminds me - \n\nI had a ridiculously large room as a teenager. My mom had the house built when I was 14, in a town in a region popular with tourists. There was some discussion about the plans between her and extended family (one grandmother with her partner, uncles, aunts) about the space distribution. \n\nSee, the guest room was (and still is) adjacent to my teen room and while mine was large as mentioned, the guest room was really small. The extended family said it would make more sense to reduce the space of mine and add it to the guest room so there was more comfort for them when they visit.\n\nTo them, my mom said, \"She's a teenager. She already spends most time in her room, teens practically live in their rooms and have friends over to sleep there all the time. And since she lives there all the time, it makes sense she has more space and comfort. The guest room is big enough as planned.\" \n\nTo me, she said, \"Hell I'll give them a big comfy room as a free holiday retreat! Guest rooms are supposed to be practical and nice for a couple of nights, but remember, when guests get too comfortable in there they overstay their welcome.\"   \nI mean, it had what it needed. A bed, a closet, a chair, and even a tiny desk (those small things that are okay for writing a note or a postcard, but not to do actual work). Clean, nice, practical. \n\nAnd that's the story of how spoiled teenage me got an irresponsible big room - because my mom refused to play free bed&breakfast for the extended family.\n\nTo keep it somewhat on-topic: \n\nI almost wouldn't be surprised if a side-goal of the room-sharing plan of OP's stepparent and mother was to intentionally make it not more comfortable for the sisters than necessary so that the girls move out asap once they're old enough, or at least the 18yr old. \n\nSince OP didn't say much about OP's stepbrother getting punished in any way, it almost sounds like there's also a golden son trumps scapegoat bio-sister dynamic going on, in addition to the \"whose d\\*\\*k I screw his children I please\" pattern that puts both steps over mom's bio daughter when it pleases stepdad.\n\nIt's a total mess. The mother could have done a world of good by treating all three children fairly and reasonably but is too busy to please her new husband, who might actually put his son on a pedestal and is willing to favour the stepdaughter (OP) when it gives him a chance to show his bio daughter where she stands (don't get me wrong, the way stepsis treats OP is not okay at all, and OP did nothing wrong in this situation, she was manipulated coldly be the stepbrother. But I'd love to hear the stepsister's perception of this blended family and where her frustration primarily lies.)\n\nOP is NTA and her being removed from the situation is better for her and could actually be a chance for her mom and steps to face the actual messed up situation at hand, now that their buffer and distraction from the golden child/scapegoat bullshit is gone.",

Just because I can put up with his disregard for anyone, his constant sarcasm, and overall jackassery doesn't make him nice. I just learned how to deal with him and not take a victim's mindset and whine about my situation. It isn't that bad, especially when you compare to other people's situation. I had friends and cousins that slept in the same bed until they were teens. I am lucky, but I'm not obscenely lucky, I'm extremely grateful for my parents, but my brothers are more of a nuisance.  \nNow, I may seem like a hypocrite, as I'm about to talk/complain about my own issues. However, it is just an example of how I also dealt with shit and it really isn't that bad in the big picture.  \nWhen I was in third grade all the way to 8th, I slept in a bunk bed under my brother(2 years older). This may not sound too bad but the thing is, he couldn't control his bladder. And his mattress was sick of it... so, one night, as I was sleeping. I heard a pattering... I woke up looked to the side and saw liquid falling from my brother's bunk. I was confused, and then realization struck, it was his pee. So from then on(it was around 6th grade when this started happening) every night I would stay on one specific corner of my bed so that if his bladder gave out, I would only get some drops that hit off of my mattress. I would spend weeks at a time sleeping on the couch just to avoid his horrible liquids and my now stinky mattress. Any and all pee stains on my mattress(and there are a fair few)... well they weren't mine.",

When we moved to a house where they had their own rooms the bathroom was suddenly free a lot more. I know parents don't want to think about this but I'd rather they be doing that than off having sex somewhere and teens (both boys and girls) do masturbate quite a lot, sometimes multiple times per day. Me personally I don't wanna walk in on that nor have anyone see me in a compromising position with my partner so we have a pretty strict knock first rule that usually works to avoid these sticky situations pun intended LOL. I'd rather just be upfront with my kids and expect it rather than have it seen as something shameful. It's normal yes but no one else needs to see it or the evidence. Much better when there is enough space for everyone to have privacy but if you don't have it, you have to consider everyone's needs and do the best you can to share the space.",
