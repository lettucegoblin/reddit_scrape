I am nineteen now and my stepdad has (and continues to) treat me as if I am a buzzkill since I was little. He's better than your wife - he tries to hide it and doesn't exclude me from things as a result. But he has mentioned before that he prefers spending time with his young sons as opposed to me in a tearful heart-to-heart (minus my heart because I have stopped trusting him for a while...) This is especially hurtful to me because when I was a kid he was the 'fun parent' and I felt closer to him than I did my biological mom because she was going through it at the time. But he sees it as I 'never liked him' and that I just never enjoyed anything he did (even though I did, quite a lot). He has also called me a robot 'jokingly' on many occasions, which always resulted in me crying alone in my room as a kid because I was literally bullied at school for not expressing my emotions well. My mom implies that it was a bad joke, but nothing to be angry over if I bring it up. Even as a young child, I was expected to be the adult and forgive childish actions. \n\nI am autistic, but it's not something that's noticeable unless I tell you. It means I struggled more with facial expressions as a kid. I understand them well now and subconsciously make the expressions I'm supposed to when around others, (like I said people can't tell I'm autistic at all) but if I'm tired or with people who know me very well I tend to slip back into having less expressions because it's less mentally tiring. Although being autistic comes with challenges, I am happy that I'm autistic because it allows me to think in a way that other people can't, and it makes it easier to pursue my interests. My stepdad is one of the main causes of my insecurity around it, and although I love my mom I can't forgive her for allowing him to treat me this way especially when she was the main reason I thrived despite childhood disability. \n\nMy issues with my stepdad extend far beyond him treating me like an emotionless husk, and it's frankly one of the least bad things he has done to me. But it has caused me endless grief about myself and my childhood - especially looking back and realizing that as a kid the adult I felt closest to resented me for traits that make me who I am. Childhood me didn't deserve it, my heart breaks for eight year old me. \n\nI assume Leo isn't autistic, but regardless your wife's comments will hurt him for much of his life, especially since these are formative years when people come to terms with who they are. Him not being 'bubbly' doesn't mean he deserves less love. I am a very happy and excitable person, but unless you take the time to get to know me you wouldn't be able to tell from the outside. Your son doesn't deserve this. You need to seriously consider what magnitude of abuse you are willing to be directed towards your son.",

Like if my sibling failed a class, it was somehow my fault for not realizing they were struggling and giving free tutoring.

But she is purposefully spinning a narrative that will make Adam hate Leo and that is 100% not okay. </p>\n\n<p>If she&#39;s willing to do this to your son, imagine what she might do to you if you start acting a way she &#39;doesn&#39;t approve of&#39;. </p>\n\n<p>Divorce sucks, but sometimes it&#39;s honestly the best option. </p>\n\n<p>Also, in all of this, be sure to reassure Leo that you love him and you do not blame him for ANY OF THIS. That is such a tender age and he could really be taking on some self-hate right now.</p>\n</div>",

How often does she make comments critical of his personality (or, given all he's been through, how he's grieving) in front of him, Adam, and you?  Does she also do so in front of people outside the immediate family, or 'apologize' for him in such settings?\n\nWhich is why she doesn't have to have said m anything to Adam specifically about this event to form his opinion - he's already learned the acceptable view of Leo in his family: that he doesn't want to be with the family, that he'll ruin the mood if he is, that he's uptight and antisocial.
