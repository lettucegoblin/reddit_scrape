They were all under 11 at the time.\n\nBack then the drinking age in the Netherlands was still 16. It was maybe two days before chirstmas and everyone got together at an Aunt's house (also not aunt by blood but affectionate title) for dinner. \n\nI was thrown in with the kids at the kids table and  not allowed to drink wine, even a single glass.

I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.\n\n\nMy father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\n\n\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \n\n\nWhen my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n\n\nI put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.\n\n\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I was ~18 I wasn't allowed a license while living at home because of insurance.  I offered to get a job and pay my own way but they had multiple cars and still didn't allow it.  Got a job anyway but not for car/license or anything.  We all had just moved back from overseas so I was getting acclimated with how things worked back stateside.  They were claiming me as a dependant, which I -sort of was.  I wasn't paying rent but I didn't have a say in how \"behind\" I was in schooling or life skills because they dragged me all around the world when I was a minor and it really set me back in a lot of ways as an adult.  I didn't get any allowance.   Ok - I never saw a tax return but learned to work around that by taking my full pay and doing my taxes at the end of the year myself without a return.  I didn't pay rent but was just saving money.   I initially didn't go to college which sucked but that's another issue.   I *didn't* get my license until I was 20 because I was still living at home/working.  I only got it because they needed someone to help with a big move. \n\nAnyway - my point isn't \"I had it worse\" (Oh,  and I never had an allowance in my life, just because they were assholes about it, not because they couldn't afford it). -But that I've been in a similar position.\n\nOnly you can gauge your family dynamic but your parents seem similar to mine when I was about your age.   There is this strange \"gap\" where they get ot have *your cake* and *eat it too* because \"you are living under this roof\" - which is true.\n\nWhat I did with my parents at the time (and it didn't help, but once again, they were assholes) - and what I suggest you do now is first let the \"them being pissed\" at you embarrassing them first. - let those emotions subside, maybe give it a week.   Then ask to have a family meeting.\n\nAs calmly as possible point out what you pointed out in the post above - and here is the risk.\n\n\"I'm living at home, I acknowledge that, I don't pay rent, I'm thankful of that.  I work and I make some of my own money.\"   \n\"2 weeks ago you functionally used me as a babysitter for the rest of the kids.  That's fine.  The excuse you used was \"I was a kid\" -that's fine.  I let it slide but it was on my mind and  it annoyed me, but I let it go\"\n\n\"Then, when I saw that all of the kids that I was charged with watching over while other adults who dis invited me did their own thing started handing out what looked like babysitter money, I jokingly requested.\"  This made you angry because I'm guessing you felt embarrassed.  I apologize.  That wasn't my intention.\n\nOk.  Is that what you expect of me?  For my ability to stay here rent free, which I'm thankful for, to occasionally also be embarrassed by being dis-invited and told \"I'm still a kid\" as an excuse to be exclude - while also not being paid to watch the real kids.  Is that the price of \"Rent\"?  Because that's also within your right.   I just want to know so I know what to expect and I don't get embarrassed and I don't embarrass you.\n\nHere is the trick.  Older adults get caught off-guard when a younger adult or \"kid\" in their eyes confronts them in and adult manner.  It's tough to execute because they also will get emotional over it (defensive) and you will likely too.\n\nThe equation boils down to \"how much of a hassle is it worth?\"\n\nAt the end of it you can ask them to not use the excuse that you are still a kid for free labor.  If they don't want to pay you for it, that's also fine, but ask openly for \"the favor\" - unless they feel it's an obligation, if that's the case - you can ask them that too.\n\nThis is where the risk is.\n\nAsshole parents do exist - I had to dodge, weave, pick my battles (many more I didn't write about) especially when I was in that 16-20 grey area.  It was a pain in the ass because they kept being obtuse about everything.  Defensive about everything, and I let the majority of things slide because I didn't want to trigger their punitive \"fine, start paying rent or you are kicked out\" nuclear option - which is always there.  That's why I said it's up to you to gauge it.\n\nI don't think you were the asshole in any of it but I think only you can really evaluate if it's the \"hill you want to die on.\"\n\nIf I were in your shoes and I was making decent enough money where the \"money\" didn't matter - I'd just shorten the family talk to a quick apology about embarrassing them and as a separate request don't frame you babysitting as happenstance kids being kids.  \n\nIf you guys have a good sense of humor I'd bring up pornhub and show them what other 18 year olds are doing for money and then ask them if they are also still just kids. - but that's sort of your equivalent nuclear option.\n\nKnowing what I know now deescalating, even if you know you are right - reaps the greatest rewards or at the very least holds back the greatest losses in the long run.\n\nGood luck.",

It&#39;s tough to execute because they also will get emotional over it (defensive) and you will likely too.</p>\n\n<p>The equation boils down to &quot;how much of a hassle is it worth?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>At the end of it you can ask them to not use the excuse that you are still a kid for free labor.  If they don&#39;t want to pay you for it, that&#39;s also fine, but ask openly for &quot;the favor&quot; - unless they feel it&#39;s an obligation, if that&#39;s the case - you can ask them that too.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the risk is.</p>\n\n<p>Asshole parents do exist - I had to dodge, weave, pick my battles (many more I didn&#39;t write about) especially when I was in that 16-20 grey area.  It was a pain in the ass because they kept being obtuse about everything.  Defensive about everything, and I let the majority of things slide because I didn&#39;t want to trigger their punitive &quot;fine, start paying rent or you are kicked out&quot; nuclear option - which is always there.  That&#39;s why I said it&#39;s up to you to gauge it.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think you were the asshole in any of it but I think only you can really evaluate if it&#39;s the &quot;hill you want to die on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If I were in your shoes and I was making decent enough money where the &quot;money&quot; didn&#39;t matter - I&#39;d just shorten the family talk to a quick apology about embarrassing them and as a separate request don&#39;t frame you babysitting as happenstance kids being kids.  </p>\n\n<p>If you guys have a good sense of humor I&#39;d bring up pornhub and show them what other 18 year olds are doing for money and then ask them if they are also still just kids. - but that&#39;s sort of your equivalent nuclear option.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing what I know now deescalating, even if you know you are right - reaps the greatest rewards or at the very least holds back the greatest losses in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n</div>",

I'm so sick of people proclaiming that because it's family you should do free work. If you want to work for free, that should be your choice and not a choice made by others for you. \n\nMy grandfather would pay me for doing chores around the camp. (He lived there year round and there was always chores) Even though he paid for my food and for my living expenses while there, (I would go anytime I had time off from school from 8yrs old to 18yrs old) he taught me that my time is valuable and to not let people take that for granted.

Well, that, and maybe exactly how treacly you were in asking for money. ;-) Otherwise, you are not the asshole, and all the adults were assholes about this. Especially Mom &amp; Dad. WTF, Mom and Dad? Still, I guess you could apologize. For... something. I guess?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, one idea for future, or 20/20 hindsight: maybe privately ask only your parents for money (or compensation)?</p>\n</div>",

You had no choice either so it really pisses me off and that's not even mentioning that you were only a kid when it was convenient",

If you don&#39;t want your parents to give you an itemised bill, don&#39;t give your damn parents an itemised bill! There are more mature ways to handle this situation.</p>\n</div>",

This means that she is able to have 6 kids but only 4 are allowed to be under 24 months. If she has more than 4 kids under 24 months, she will loose her license.\n\nFor the larger home daycare licence, it is 12 kids but you have to have an assistant and you have to have a house( ideally).

My younger one, for example, will start wedging herself between me and the stove if I ignore her after a while. I have also used the 'I have given you the reason already, this discussion is over' line, but sometimes a child's tenacity for a cookie will cause them to have selective hearing loss. Also, hearing your child meltdown and cry next to you for not getting a cookie as they've pestered you for 15min already (and you are tired from a day at work, getting the kids up and to daycare/school, getting them home again, and mediating their other antics while you try to cook supper) is harder to ignore than you may think. I spent six years in the army and thought I could handle anything someone threw at me, but the years of sleep-deprivation, hormones, and slow chipping at your willpower that children provide you with mean you will not always be able to ignore them literally trying to crawl up your legs while begging for a cookie.\n\n- Them hitting each other is not related to the independent grown-ups thing; it's the 'be rational and objective to your offspring' resolution that many parents aspire to and don't always achieve. Separating two toddlers and explaining that a) you can't just take a toy because you like it, and b) you can't hit someone because you think they've wronged you, is difficult to you as they are full of big emotions and attention spans of gnats. Hard to screw the intensity down and also instil a teachable moment.\n\n- Regarding curfew, I said 'teenagers' as a general term. I lived on my own at 17 anyway, so it was a moot point then, but not once while living at home was I allowed to 'stay out' so late. A sleepover, for example, I was dropped off at the friend's house and was expected to remain at that location until being picked up again the next day. There was no wandering around town in the deal.\n\n- I don't know OP's situation, but adult conversation might be the older adults wanting to discuss family matters they don't feel OP should be privy to, discussion of alcohol or drug use that they would prefer not to share with OP (I know I don't intend to share lurid stories of being drunk in my twenties to my kids when they're 19). Also the sense of humour and generational culture is very different between a 19 year old and a 25 year old, or a 30 year old, or a 50 year old. At my work, my main colleagues are 24 and 56. I am 33, and have very different conversations with each of them as the shared culture is not completely compatible.\n\nI hope I clarified things a bit more.",

I am glad to have discussed this with you, as I think I am not very concerned.

The parents hosting the sleepover have to sleep sometime.\n\nI think treating a 19 year old as if they should not be told family matters is incredibly rude and detrimental to the health of the 19 year old. They are an adult now, and need to be treated as such in order to complete the maturation process. I intend to tell my kids about my drug adventures at a much younger age than 19. How else can they learn from my mistakes if I do not discuss them openly? I suppose I don't care so much about age, but I do tailor my discussions based on people's perspectives and attitudes.

I hope you know I am not saying any of these statements as a way of judging you or what you do (which I admittedly know little about).
