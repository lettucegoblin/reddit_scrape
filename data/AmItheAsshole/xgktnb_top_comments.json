You do realise that this kind of opposition to a lock on the bathroom door is not normal, right? most places come with bathroom locks to begin with and I\u2019m betting when any of you uses bathrooms outside of your home you lock the door as well. The disregard of not only your BIL but also your husband to you personal space, boundaries and privacy is a giant red flag (just like silent treatment btw) and a much bigger sign of a bad relationship than having doors you can lock (which, again, is totally normal). You didn\u2019t \u201eviolate an agreement you were part of\u201c any more than your BIL violated the very basic agreement of not entering a bathroom while knowing someone else is in there. If he weren\u2019t doing it on purpose, he would have been extra careful after \u201eaccidentally\u201c walking in on you for the first time. Idk about your house, but pretty much all places I\u2019ve lived you would notice if for example the shower is running or the bathroom light is on. Even more irritating than your BIL is your husband however. He should not be caring more about some weird no-locks-rule than your comfort about living in your own home. It\u2019s your place too, you have every right to change something about it which is not only minor but proven to be necessary. You deserve to be happy and have basic right of privacy, if you can\u2019t in your home you should consider moving before this creepy behaviour escalates.",

I started taking more care to lock my dorm room door, even though I shouldn't have had to in order to have reasonable expectation of privacy (I would lock it at night when I was sleeping, of course, but saw no reason to do so when I was juat hanging out, as it was a single dorm and would slow me down if i needed to get up and go down the hall to the restroom, etc. - that is, until my friend started being weird).\n\nOur friendship ended because of an unrelated disagreement where she said some disrespectful and pretty unforgivable things. Then, she tried to weaponize the staff in student life against me by dalsky accusing me of harassing her after I was told she was asking around about me and texted her to ask if she was okay, with the possibility in mind of reconciling the friendship. Then, she went out of her way to harass me by having a boyfriend send me mean messages.\n\nCome to find out: She Instagram messaged me years later with an apology saying that she was sorry she turned on me. Apparently, she had been struggling with her sexuality and had a crush on me, and didn't know how to deal with it - so, I guess, she decided to take it out on me. \n\nAll of this is to say that in hindsight, violating my privacy had clearly NOT been an accident. \n\nThe shitty thing is she was hot and a fantastic friend who looked out for me and taught me things (like baking and stuff, as I had never lived alone prior to college) prior to all the weirdness and the falling out and I totally wouldn't have rejected her if she had just been honest about her feelings instead of getting weird. \n\nThe tl;dr of this is that, in my experience, this sort of behavior isn't an accident. Maybe even check to see if there are hidden cameras around the house if your BIL has access when you aren't home?",
