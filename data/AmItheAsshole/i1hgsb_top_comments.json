Married less than a year later, has three kids immediately, doesn\u2019t take any action when it\u2019s her jewelry destroyed? Seems fishy to me. \n4. Read where it says \u201coldest 3\u201d kids are destroying the jewelry. That\u2019s 8, 7, and around 5-6. That age is an age where children begin to think about others more than themselves and know solidly the difference between right and wrong. Unless this mother stowed them away in homeschooling and never let them see the light of day, these are things they are well aware of at this age. They may not have realized that the jewelry was worth so much but they still went into someone else\u2019s room and took someone else\u2019s property and actively destroyed it. \n5. For anyone saying that the stepmom was involved in the jewelry destruction, hard yes. She said that it was \u201csacrilegious\u201d and \u201cidols\u201d and that is INCREDIBLY anti-Semitic, involving the Star of David and the fact that this jewelry was all within a Jewish family before she arrived. I think that she sees herself as some sort of savior and got the kids involved so she couldn\u2019t be held accountable. Well. Glad it\u2019s going to court. \n6. Finally, yes, destroying each of their favorite toys is probably not the best and most mature action but please bear in mind that OP is not yet 18, so actions may not be the most adult because OP should not be expected to act as an adult because she IS NOT ONE. Toys can be expensive, but it is highly unlikely that 3 toys would add up to $50,000. Not to mention the historic and familial value of the jewelry as well. If the children are so upset about their toys, you can bet Stepmom will just take them to the toy store and buy new ones. Did y\u2019all read \u201cplayroom\u201d and that there are 6 children and 2 adults in the house and it\u2019s plenty big enough for all of them. The family is well off. The children will have their toys replaced. The fact that they went to the dollar store to \u201creplace\u201d her jewelry while you know from the story that the family is darn well off just infuriates me.

I'm confused, and tell her I've been wearing it since I was a baby and that my mom says its part of our culture. She kind of dismissed it, and when my mom picks me up she mentions something about how \"dressed up\" I am, which confused my mom because I was wearing jeans and a tshirt.\n\nMy friend later told me that her mother believed my mom draped me in gold to show off how rich our family was. It was kind of ridiculous, because the adults in my family started out as struggling refugees who worked their asses off so they could raise their kids as solidly middle class, and my friend's family was way more well off than ours.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if OP's stepmom took it the same way - the very existence of this nice thing OP had could've made her feel like OP was lording it over her, even if OP never mentioned it.

When Christianity was more imposing, the Jews were persecuted for not being Christian. In Islamic countries, the Jews are persecuted because they\u2019re not Muslim. In the Roman Empire, the Jews were persecuted because they shared a different culture than the Romans.

And so on.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of it is actually true (I only know what I\u2019ve been taught as a Jew), but Jewish history as I was taught was filled with a lot of hatred. The religion began a couple thousand years ago and hasn\u2019t changed all that much since then (or so we\u2019re led to believe). The reason why the Jews cycled through so many lands and cultures (actually, they haven\u2019t really been to East Asia much) was because they were around for so long and because they were chased out sometimes. The reason why they remain a minority is supposedly because they were killed off in many generations.
