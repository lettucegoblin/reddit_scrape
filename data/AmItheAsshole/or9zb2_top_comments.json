Surely you could have taken the time to at least talk to your coworkers if this was such an urgent situation (which would have been apparent from the frequency of calls). I also aknowledge that it is also the fault of your coworker who should have asked you for the files, but the fact you supervise him should at least give you an idea of what he ll need.

If you\u2019re working a cash register in retail, you deserve an uninterrupted vacation, and it\u2019s on your employer to staff in your absence. But the higher up the ladder you go, and as you get into professions like doctor, lawyer, engineer, where you have a lot of specialized, individual knowledge about your clients or you actually owe them legal duties of care, it gets more iffy. If you choose to take a position of responsibility (and the usually much higher comp that goes with it), there are trade offs that start to creep in, and one of them is that you may not get that completely uninterrupted vacay. \n\nAlso, the existence of smart phones and widely accessible WiFi means that, in most cases, you have the ability to at least check emails/vm pretty easily. If you have the ability to check in, say, once a day for a few minutes, just to make sure there are no emergencies erupting, and you just choose not to do that, I can see coworkers being miffed and clients getting upset. In my line of work, even with fully supportive coworkers, people checking my emails and answering calls when I\u2019m out, and carefully thought-out file transfers to address known work that needs to be done in my absence, it really wouldn\u2019t be reasonable for me to just not look at my phone at all for a whole week. It\u2019s annoying af some times, but it\u2019s part of doing a job I love and being paid well to do it. \n\nThis is hard to judge without knowing what OP\u2019s exact position/responsibilities are, what the expectations are generally for people in OP\u2019s industry to make themselves available and, as others have said, what efforts were actually made by the coworker to find the file and contact OP. If there\u2019s a bunch of desperate emails / missed calls on OP\u2019s phone from coworker explaining the emergency and asking for the file, and OP could have responded with a quick two line email about where it was and just chose not to because \u201cCW had his chance before I left,\u201d that\u2019s getting toward AH. If the coworker sent one lazy email asking for the file, didn\u2019t express urgency, and then never followed up with OP or the office in making other attempts to find the file, that\u2019s on CW rather than OP.\n\nEdit: a word",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I mean, it really depends on your position and profession. If you\u2019re working a cash register in retail, you deserve an uninterrupted vacation, and it\u2019s on your employer to staff in your absence. But the higher up the ladder you go, and as you get into professions like doctor, lawyer, engineer, where you have a lot of specialized, individual knowledge about your clients or you actually owe them legal duties of care, it gets more iffy. If you choose to take a position of responsibility (and the usually much higher comp that goes with it), there are trade offs that start to creep in, and one of them is that you may not get that completely uninterrupted vacay. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the existence of smart phones and widely accessible WiFi means that, in most cases, you have the ability to at least check emails/vm pretty easily. If you have the ability to check in, say, once a day for a few minutes, just to make sure there are no emergencies erupting, and you just choose not to do that, I can see coworkers being miffed and clients getting upset. In my line of work, even with fully supportive coworkers, people checking my emails and answering calls when I\u2019m out, and carefully thought-out file transfers to address known work that needs to be done in my absence, it really wouldn\u2019t be reasonable for me to just not look at my phone at all for a whole week. It\u2019s annoying af some times, but it\u2019s part of doing a job I love and being paid well to do it. </p>\n\n<p>This is hard to judge without knowing what OP\u2019s exact position/responsibilities are, what the expectations are generally for people in OP\u2019s industry to make themselves available and, as others have said, what efforts were actually made by the coworker to find the file and contact OP. If there\u2019s a bunch of desperate emails / missed calls on OP\u2019s phone from coworker explaining the emergency and asking for the file, and OP could have responded with a quick two line email about where it was and just chose not to because \u201cCW had his chance before I left,\u201d that\u2019s getting toward AH. If the coworker sent one lazy email asking for the file, didn\u2019t express urgency, and then never followed up with OP or the office in making other attempts to find the file, that\u2019s on CW rather than OP.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: a word</p>\n</div>",

Once I felt better I fixed it all in 7 hours on a Sunday (my off day) and they were cut checks the next business day. I literally have to schedule EVERYTHING around Mondays since it&#39;s payroll day. I&#39;m going on vacation this week and it starts Tuesday. Taking my kid to college, leaving on a Tuesday. It sucks not having a backup. I&#39;m going away Xmas week including Monday and I warned them already. 2 weeks after that conversation I started training my backup smh.</p>\n</div>",

She should know how their subordinates act in certain situations and be able to either adapt to it, or get them to act according to what she considers appropriate. At the end of the day, the collective actions of her team lie on her as a supervisor. If they do good she&#39;ll get the praise, if they do wrong she&#39;ll get the chewing out. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are all adults here and coworker should be able to do her job without OP looking over her shoulder and holding her hand all the time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a coworker, a subordinate. I wouldn&#39;t like it if one member of my team screwed up like that, but I know which members of my team I have to hound to get them to do things in a deadline and which don&#39;t, that&#39;s part of my role as a supervisor, as a manager of people. I don&#39;t like holding the hand of the people in my team nor do I like to hound them, so I&#39;m teaching them to be self reliant but until I feel like every one of them can actually manage themselves I have to hound them, because they are my team, my responsibility.</p>\n</div>",
