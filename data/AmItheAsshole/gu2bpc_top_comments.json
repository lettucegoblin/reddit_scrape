The final straw was when she sent a buddy who worked in HR to \"talk\" to her about her inappropriate dress code.\n\nMy friend did not violate the dress code at all and they couldn't pin anything on her. She wears maxi dresses and blazers to work. She has cleavage because she is a woman with boobs. But the HR person and the bully only wanted to intimidate her. The meeting wasn't even recorded.\n\nSo my friend reported both of them. She had witnesses make statements. The bully was screwed because she had been doing this sort of thing for years and nobody ever stood up to her so she thought she was invincible. She also quit before there was any action taken against her and the HR person got away with it because of lack of evidence.

I would never in a million years do such a thing. My boss had a meeting with me and asked me about it and I was shocked, and said I would never do that.

I know she has struggled with the attention her boobs brought her; she works in a male-dominated STEM field and a fit, unusually busty blonde woman sticks out in that environment. People sometimes treat her like her existence is obscene. She was considering getting a reduction, but has since decided not to, and has been focusing on building up her back muscles to reduce back pain.\n\nI really miss the androgynous body I had as a child; I liked being flat. I was never shamed or teased about my chest size, I just preferred not having boobs in my way all the time. I sometimes think about getting a reduction, but ultimately I don't think it is worth it for me, and I've mostly accepted my chest.\n\nUltimately, I think being healthy and comfortable with your body is the most important thing here, and 9/10 times you don't *need* to have surgery to learn how to be comfortable with yourself. Sometimes extra support and love, and professional counseling can do that.",

I\u2019ve seen a couple people mention cardigans and sweaters and I could not second this nor promote it enough. Big knit sweaters have that baggy look but still look stylish, they really help me when I\u2019m having a bad boob day (you know the days where no matter what you put on or try on, you\u2019re just really unhappy with the outcome). But for normal days where I\u2019m not having a boob crisis, nice blouses, v-necks, square cut necks (these are my absolute favorite), with a cardigan or open sweater, definitely do the job. I can look professional/classy/stylish but I have material covering the sides of my boobs so they don\u2019t appear to stand out/stick out near as much. And at the same time I can wear clothing that fits my waist and isn\u2019t extremely baggy just to hide my boobs. Cardigans are a life saver and they make me feel extremely comfortable. At work if I catch a glimpse of myself and I get nervous and feel that my boobs are just \u2018too out there\u2019 you can pull the cardigan closer together or bunch up the material on the sides so it hides more. The comfort I have found in them is incredible and definitely makes a major difference in how I feel about my appearance all day long(: I wish you the best and know, you are not alone in these boob struggles, boobs can quite honestly be the worst.",
