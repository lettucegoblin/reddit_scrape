When he first died I went every single day. I couldn\u2019t help it as he\u2019s buried right next to where my work is based and I walked past it every day and it felt wrong not to go.  Now I only go once in a while but I religiously go on his anniversary. Anyone who knows me that date is marked in concrete for me. I always take three days off work, birthday (date before he died), anniversary, and the day after because that\u2019s when the cops came to tell us he died.\n\nI mention this so you understand I can totally empathise with your situation and it is a terrible thing your (ex) friend asked you to do.  \n\nI also lost two people close to me due to a drunk driver, my uncle and two year old cousin.  It totally ruined my father and tipped him over the edge after suffering one too many personal tragedies.  If you\u2019re going to drink, get a taxi or Uber or have a friend pick you up. Don\u2019t drink and drive or drug drive because it absolute shatters families when people are senselessly taken like that.",

Take care. \n\n\n\n\n\n>She tried to explain to us by having the wedding on that day, it will turn a negative situation into a positive one. \n\n\nFor her maybe, but for you it's incredibly cruel & heartless! I only just found your post & couldn't believe a \"friend\" would suggest getting married that day. \n\nYou lost your mum, your husband & your daughter. Her wedding would undoubtedly remind you of yours,  which would be hard.  However,  it would also given the day compound the grief of all you lost on that day. We expect to out live our parents,  it's so common we have the word orphan. We know that one spouse usually passes first we have widow/widower. There's no word for a parent who survives their child, the loss is too much. I might be wrong but I'm assuming your daughter was a child, so you will never be mother-of-the-bride, helping her into her dress.  So why on earth would anyone want to remind you of that on the anniversary of their deaths? \n\n\nYou don't need to gate-keep that date,  no ordinary person who knew your family would pick that day to celebrate something. The  to invite you, when only 15 can attend & demand you not visit their graves???!!!! No ome has the right to ask you not to visit their graves. Your actions before & after someone's event are none of their business! What sort of twisted person would think this up & act on it . Did the groom-to-be know the significance of the day for you? & about that private conversation? It had to be private because she knew how wrong it was & if not for Reddit you wouldn't have told anyone. That's how good a person you are, you couldn't imagine that someone could be ao manipulative & malicious.\n\n\n>When she realized she wasn\u2019t convincing enough, it felt as though a mask had fallen from her face and she started yelling and insulting me. She said that she is tired of having to play the supportive friend role and that it\u2019s been 7 years, I should just get over it by now or go join my family in the ground.\n\n\nWhat a throughly vile & disgusting excuse for a human. Not one drop of empathy or anything close to basic humanity. Yes, we learn to live with grief over time, but we don't forget those we lost. Graves exist because we remember our dead. When my husband & I married we placed the top table flowers on my paternal & maternal grandparents graves. We gave his mum my bouquet to plave on her mother's grave & the smaller top table bouquet. My sister had done similar after her wedding,  although our paternal grandmother was still alive then. Weddings remind us of other weddings, it's human nature, which means they remind us of happy times with deceased loved ones. \n\n>My friends have offered to go visit my family\u2019s graves together with me, I accepted and we are now planning to also make a scrapbook with my family's pictures. For once I am actually looking forward to this day, and will start to plan more eventful activities like this.\n\nI'm glad it's turned out to be a positive.",

We're in a small area and there were 3 dates open at the venue we'd chosen We chose the date furthest from that day, so we had plenty of time to plan. It happened to be the day my best friend's brother was killed and I was only thinking of the wedding obviously. When I told her she actually said it would give a more positive feel to the day. I was still extremely hesitant to do it then. She insisted. He was practically my family too, but her mom declined the invite. It had been over 15 years but I understood, and still offered to change the date. They all insisted understanding the tight scheduling of the venue. We went through with it and made sure to make a moment for memories. It's a bitter sweet day for me, and my friend knows this--obviously it is for her too. It's a day our lives changed in many ways at different times. I learned a lot in dealing with and watching her family deal with his death. We drifted in ways and grew closer in ways, we're still best friends obviously, but I would never take that for granted. If she had needed to mourn instead. I would have gladly let her. I seriously would have changed the day to still include her, but I didn't at her insistence. As it turned out, her daughter ended up puking sick and they had to leave early anyway. Lol What a day...   \nI hope your friend sees the error of her ways and you can patch things up. Wedding planning makes some a little crazy and even the most selfless turn crazy selfish for a period of time. I can't imagine your heart ache at the loss of your family AND potentially a friend because of it. Hang in there.",

They are only ever good at narcississm if they have an audience and preferably one who doesn\u2019t understand the traits so hasn\u2019t spotted the handbook they all work to.\n\nOnce you see that they all operate to exactly the same extremely limited range of attention seeking acts all as deep as pressing buttons to activate each setting, they lose their power and prowess. When you think he is the Wizard of Oz you are dazzled and dumbstruck. When you see he is a wee auld fella behind a curtain you are indifferent.\n\nThe opposite of love is not hate. It is indifference. No emotional reaction or power is possible if you are indifferent. Narcissistic people like being loved or hated because both centre attention on them directly or indirectly. Indifferent deflates them and makes them irrelevant.\n\nThey are just people pressing star key for \u2018insult your dead relative!\u2019 hash for \u2018I can\u2019t live without you\u2019. They are robots built from the same soulless shape of human parts and thus like a factory made item from robot to laptop they are not the best. They are simply fitted to the requirement level needed. What they and others mistake for the best is simply higher spec. It\u2019s just extreme not better in the way a Carolina Reaper chilli is just the hottest chilli not necessarily the tastiest or most suitable for an enjoyable meal.\n\nThe fact they are incapable of this insight means no narcissist is good at it. They are just wired that way. It\u2019s like saying my Macbook is the best at being a Macbook. You might prefer a PC and even within computers you have preferences for capabilities such as graphics. But it comes preloaded. It doesn\u2019t work to be the best little Macbook in the world. It just does what it does.\n\nSometimes we project our own humanity onto the non sentient that the Macbook makes us able to make those graphics and forget it is just a tool alongside our talent, practice or discipline. It just puts out what we put in but we need it more than it needs us. It exists in the same capacity without us. We are changed by it.\n\nThis is what narcissists capitalise on in relationships. They make you feel like they are special and the only way to be the way we are via them. When actually like our Macbook they do make us reach different aspects of ourselves but so could any other Macbook because they cannot deviate from the operating system while we recognise that we put our personality in to get that feeling of a bond with the tool that processes it.\n\nThere is a delightful irony Apple (based on the poisoned apple that killed Alan Turing but taken from the poisoned apple in Snow White with the evil stepmother) became the world changing brand it is under Steve Jobs who was a raging narcissist. It\u2019s why as a brand it illicits a love hate response unlike Samsung. It\u2019s designed to polarise and provoke strong feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s the ultimate representation of narcissism. You get the same thing from any of them. You just notice it more when they upsell you the headphones or the deluxe \u2018why can\u2019t I make my wedding about your dead family after putting in 7 years attention tokens for my payout\u2019 package like Amy.\n\nYou either end up resigning yourself that Apple is what is and just shrugging or you continue to buy their products and wonder why when you know they charge stupid amounts for cables and  frustrates you in trying to outwit it or embrace it.\n\nApple isn\u2019t the best company in the world. It\u2019s sometimes the best at the aspects what it exists to do. But it doesn\u2019t care about being the best. It just cares you think it is the best and respond emotionally to that with love or hate. If you treat it and narcissists as an appliance about 90% of the power of either will go.\n\nNarcissists can see themselves as best by external validation only. It\u2019s better to simply think of them as how high on the level of extremeness they are than giving it the emotion of best. It breaks the cycle they rely on and bursts the bubble. \n\nAmy is just the touch bar retina screen version of narcissism. In other words touchy AF and swivelly eyed in most settings but useful in very specific skill sets but not best. More just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should.",

We are changed by it.</p>\n\n<p>This is what narcissists capitalise on in relationships. They make you feel like they are special and the only way to be the way we are via them. When actually like our Macbook they do make us reach different aspects of ourselves but so could any other Macbook because they cannot deviate from the operating system while we recognise that we put our personality in to get that feeling of a bond with the tool that processes it.</p>\n\n<p>There is a delightful irony Apple (based on the poisoned apple that killed Alan Turing but taken from the poisoned apple in Snow White with the evil stepmother) became the world changing brand it is under Steve Jobs who was a raging narcissist. It\u2019s why as a brand it illicits a love hate response unlike Samsung. It\u2019s designed to polarise and provoke strong feelings.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the ultimate representation of narcissism. You get the same thing from any of them. You just notice it more when they upsell you the headphones or the deluxe \u2018why can\u2019t I make my wedding about your dead family after putting in 7 years attention tokens for my payout\u2019 package like Amy.</p>\n\n<p>You either end up resigning yourself that Apple is what is and just shrugging or you continue to buy their products and wonder why when you know they charge stupid amounts for cables and  frustrates you in trying to outwit it or embrace it.</p>\n\n<p>Apple isn\u2019t the best company in the world. It\u2019s sometimes the best at the aspects what it exists to do. But it doesn\u2019t care about being the best. It just cares you think it is the best and respond emotionally to that with love or hate. If you treat it and narcissists as an appliance about 90% of the power of either will go.</p>\n\n<p>Narcissists can see themselves as best by external validation only. It\u2019s better to simply think of them as how high on the level of extremeness they are than giving it the emotion of best. It breaks the cycle they rely on and bursts the bubble. </p>\n\n<p>Amy is just the touch bar retina screen version of narcissism. In other words touchy AF and swivelly eyed in most settings but useful in very specific skill sets but not best. More just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should.</p>\n</div>",

Your eyes water and you rub your wound but you have to keep going because not everyone knows about your stone or if they do, they don\u2019t realize it can still bring this much pain.\n\nThere are days you are simply happy now, smiling comes easy and you laugh without thinking. You slap your leg during that laughter and you feel your stone and aren\u2019t sure whether you should be laughing still. The stone still hurts.\n\nOnce in a while you can\u2019t take your hand off that stone. You run it over your fingers and roll it in your palm and are so preoccupied by it\u2019s weight, you forget things like your car keys and home address.

You\u2019ve accepted this stone as your own, crossing your hands over it, saying \u201cmine\u201d as children do.\n\nYou rest more peacefully than you once did, you\u2019ve learned to move forward the best you can. Some days you want to show the world what a beautiful memory you\u2019re holding. But most days you twirl it through your fingers, smile and look to the sky. You squeeze your hands together and hope you are living in a way that honors the missing piece you carry, until your arms are full again\"\n\nEdit: I'm so happy this has helped so many today but I'm sorry for everyone who has felt a loss so deeply that you can relate to this. I read this months ago when I really needed to hear it and these words have stuck with me and helped more than I hoped.",
