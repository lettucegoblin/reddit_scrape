Want to take a guess how many times my parents have brought over cookies or dessert that included tree nuts? At least once every six months for going on 13 years. Mind you, this is Grandma and grandchild relationship here. Not uncle and niece. It&#39;s typically a little closer. Luckily, he&#39;s training to be a chef himself and had looked at every label for nuts since he learned to read. If it doesn&#39;t have a label and he questions it, he doesn&#39;t eat it.</p>\n\n<p>You are NTA. You knew your limitations and went far and above expectations. However, if this continues to be an issue, I would make it clear you plan to only make one meal. And if they want that to include your attempt at her limitations then everybody eats it. But that by no means do you certify that it&#39;s 100% safe. Otherwise they can either provide a meal for her or let you follow the same process you just did.</p>\n</div>",

I have a lot of allergy friends who take their own food everywhere because hobby cooks and regular people just don\u2019t have the necessary space, tools, and knowledge to avoid cross contamination. It\u2019s literally safer for them to bring their own food. Kinda sorta wondering if they\u2019re exaggerating the risk to Becca, most allergy families would appreciate the extra expense and length you went to to ensure the safety of the allergic person.",

The fact that you found a place that caters specifically to her allergens is great. \n\nIn the future, my only advice is to give people a heads up that they're getting a separate meal instead of surprise catering if you're hosting a dinner. The way you phrased it did make it seem like the whole meal would be friendly and not that you were hosting dinner and buying her food too. It's not often people are willing to cook allergen friendly meals so they're likely just acting out their disappointment in the disclusion without really thinking about how unsafe it is for you to be fucking with an allergy.",

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

Suggest your brother, SIL, and her daughter come over for a special meal that caters to her and let her help plan the menu. You can even suggest they all help prepare so they can get an idea of the effort you put in. It's a great bonding experience and hopefully it'll cool off the adults.

If a family member cooks gluten in a dedicated gluten-free pan, it\u2019s recommended to just toss it and get a new one. And porous wooden spatulas, spoons, or rolling pins?

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;ve been doing this for Becca&#39;s whole life, and forcing her to miss out any kind of fun activity. Becca is going to grow up thinking that she missed out on events because of her disease, instead of learning to adapt to the world around her.</p>\n\n<p>YOU did a great job and were accommodating. Her parents are not doing a good job of raising her to handle her diseases. It sounds like they expect you to make food that only she can have, and everyone has to eat the same thing. Which is absurd.</p>\n</div>",
