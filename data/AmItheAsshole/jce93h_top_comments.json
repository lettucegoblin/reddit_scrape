Fuck him for using his child as leverage to get away with things. Fuck him for marrying someone so homophobic. Fuck him for never stepping up to bat to defend you.

It reminds me of little kids bullshit and pettiness!! \nWhat big crawled up your SIL\u2019s ass about a guy wearing a sweatshirt a girl had worn? Half the time with sweatshirts you can\u2019t tell if their men or women\u2019s their gender neutral and don\u2019t even say because of the color oh the sweatshirt you wore. People look good in different colors outside of what are preconceived \u201cboy-girl colors\u201d. My ex used to tell me he loved when I wore dark blue and dark green because between my fair skin, eye color and hair color they went better then the pinks, lilac colors. \nI\u2019m sorry this one person has caused all of these problems in your family. I hope your brother one day soon gets hit gently on the head and snaps out of the way he is thinking and see everything and everyone this intolerant person is making him lose time with. Trust me you never know when you are going to get that phone call someone you love is in the hospital or dead and would a sweatshirt really be worth all of this?! \nGood Luck!! Don\u2019t back down from how you feel for even 1 intolerant person that\u2019s 1 person too many!! \nYou have amazing parents and I hope you have your brother and nephew back soon!",

Then the parents and grandparents have a falling out over something stupid (like this) and the parents weaponize their child and yank access rights *not* because it is in the best interests of the child, but because they want to punish their parents. Now the child has lost an important, consistent adult family member in their lives *without even knowing why*.

His connection to his grandparents (and uncle) may be the only lifeline he has to a healthy mental state, the only people who love him unconditionally for who he is. He will *need* those visits.\n\nIf parents are using their children to lash out at others, they are not taking the best interests of their child into account.
