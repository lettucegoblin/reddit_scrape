And second of all everyone else in the room, but most importantly Your Fianc\u00e9, who knew of this horrendous, sickening, and degrading tradition amongst his family were Class A, Number One Assholes. These people are so bad they deserve the word Asshole to be spelled out and capitalized. \n\nI have never heard of any family tradition, especially as it might concern a newcomer into the family, to be so heartless and cruel. \n\nYou took enormous time, and I am also guessing money, to buy these people very thoughtful and generous gifts. They on the other hand found a place that sold coal, (they probably are regulars there), and who individually wrapped up 18, yes, 18 gift boxes filled with a lump of coal. \n\nAs others have said most of us were brought up with the idea and story of bad children receiving only a lump of coal from Santa. Since you never mentioned you did something bad to this family, and judging from your post you did not do anything of the kind, they use the wrong gag gift for this cruel joke.\n\nTo make matters worse your fianc\u00e9 knew this was the type of thing that was done to newcomers before, and he never warned you. He let you buy the gifts, wrap them up, beautifully I'm sure, and give them to his family members. He sat back, and I am guessing, laughed with all the rest of the people at the party. Apparently he didn't think that this would hurt you. \n\nI thought at the end of your post you would write that the family had hidden your actual gifts and gave them to you at the end. I am so very sorry you had to go through such a degrading and miserable Christmas party with these people. \n\nI would definitely have second thoughts about marrying this man, if you would ever have to be in his family's company again.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Sends up until now nobody has exactly spelled it out, first you are NTA. And second of all everyone else in the room, but most importantly Your Fianc\u00e9, who knew of this horrendous, sickening, and degrading tradition amongst his family were Class A, Number One Assholes. These people are so bad they deserve the word Asshole to be spelled out and capitalized. </p>\n\n<p>I have never heard of any family tradition, especially as it might concern a newcomer into the family, to be so heartless and cruel. </p>\n\n<p>You took enormous time, and I am also guessing money, to buy these people very thoughtful and generous gifts. They on the other hand found a place that sold coal, (they probably are regulars there), and who individually wrapped up 18, yes, 18 gift boxes filled with a lump of coal. </p>\n\n<p>As others have said most of us were brought up with the idea and story of bad children receiving only a lump of coal from Santa. Since you never mentioned you did something bad to this family, and judging from your post you did not do anything of the kind, they use the wrong gag gift for this cruel joke.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse your fianc\u00e9 knew this was the type of thing that was done to newcomers before, and he never warned you. He let you buy the gifts, wrap them up, beautifully I&#39;m sure, and give them to his family members. He sat back, and I am guessing, laughed with all the rest of the people at the party.

I didn\u2019t want to go against tradition so I tried to hide how uncomfortable I was. I start opening it and everyone was staring at me. I opened it and it was a hideous leopard print sweater with faux fur around the neck and wrists. It is bright red leopard so it basically looks like a bloody leopard. I was trying to act like it was normal but his mom just kept making it awkward saying why don\u2019t I like it and why don\u2019t I try it on. I tried it on to be nice and they are all laughing at me. Apparently the sweater was part of the \u2018tradition\u2019 because it was so ugly and they knew no one would like it. I felt so dumb and embarrassed and they thought it was hilarious. The best part was they would re-tell the story every year to whoever was there to listen.",

If someone older than me got up, and I swiped their chair and they came back, it was expected for me to get up. \n\nOne year at a family reunion, my great uncle (he was like upper 80s iirc) entered the room. Everyone was seated, and we told him: you choose where you sit, and if someone is sitting in your seat, they'll move. \n\nThe other chair incident in my family occurred on a mother's day. We went to my uncle's restaurant which was packed. When we finally got a table, we were a chair short. Being the youngest at the time, I volunteered to stand until an available chair was available. My grandfather refused to sit until all the women were seated, which included me. So there we were, having a standoff over who had the rights to the chair. I claimed, as an elder, my grandfather (who was in his late 80s) deserved the chair, while he claimed as a female, I deserved the chair. I won when my grandfather relented and sat down.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Sheesh. My family just does generation seniority. So I can claim a chair of anyone younger than me. If someone older than me got up, and I swiped their chair and they came back, it was expected for me to get up. </p>\n\n<p>One year at a family reunion, my great uncle (he was like upper 80s iirc) entered the room. Everyone was seated, and we told him: you choose where you sit, and if someone is sitting in your seat, they&#39;ll move. </p>\n\n<p>The other chair incident in my family occurred on a mother&#39;s day. We went to my uncle&#39;s restaurant which was packed. When we finally got a table, we were a chair short. Being the youngest at the time, I volunteered to stand until an available chair was available. My grandfather refused to sit until all the women were seated, which included me. So there we were, having a standoff over who had the rights to the chair.
