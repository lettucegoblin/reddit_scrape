This was all planned at the dinner table a week ahead with none of it being a secret. My sister was right there when they invited me.\n\nLater, with my sister crying in the other room, I told my uncle that I wouldn't go because she wasn't invited. The piece of shit didn't offer her an invite and instead pretended that it was boy's only. I pointed out the fact that unless he was saying half the women in our family were actually men, that excuse was BS. He simply replied that he hadn't realised.\n\nMy sister and I went to see a movie instead. I haven't spoken to my uncle or my least favourite cousins in 5 years and I haven't missed them one bit but my sister knows she can rely on me and I know she's there for me.",

My older sister decided that the three of us should get a 'sisters only' tattoo, my brothers didn't mind at all, so cool. My sisters talked about it together, without including me. They chose a design without my input, and asked me to draw it on them with a pen. I knew what was happening, but was so desperate to be included I just went along with it. They waited for eachother while I drew on them and took photos of it together before I even started trying to draw it on myself. I was even rushing because I wanted to be in the photo too but I didn't say anything. I told them I didn't like the design and they said they'd look for another one. A week later, they've booked the appointment and only told me the morning of. I didn't go because I had about 2 hours sleep, and I was very hurt. Sis comes home and shows me - it's still the design I told them I hated, just that the linework was thicker. That was it. I burst out crying and sisters told me I was being ridiculous. They invited me, it was a different design, I just didn't want to go. So now if it's ever brought up, they gaslight me together. They say to people I was just too scared to get it done, and I just decided I didn't want to go. They laugh at me about it and twist everything to other people. If I try to contest when they're doing that, they gang up and me to make me look stupid and I can't get a word in edgeways. They take pictures of it together all the time, rubbing it in my face. Don't know why they need another picture of it every month but whatever. I'm still bitter if it's not obvious but I only have myself to blame. They exclude me from a lot of things and I still lower myself to desperately trying to be included. It's sad, really.",

They invited me, it was a different design, I just didn&#39;t want to go. So now if it&#39;s ever brought up, they gaslight me together. They say to people I was just too scared to get it done, and I just decided I didn&#39;t want to go. They laugh at me about it and twist everything to other people. If I try to contest when they&#39;re doing that, they gang up and me to make me look stupid and I can&#39;t get a word in edgeways. They take pictures of it together all the time, rubbing it in my face. Don&#39;t know why they need another picture of it every month but whatever. I&#39;m still bitter if it&#39;s not obvious but I only have myself to blame. They exclude me from a lot of things and I still lower myself to desperately trying to be included. It&#39;s sad, really.</p>\n</div>",

I think at this time you could benefit from some time away from your family to heal and to rest from all of this drama. The conversation you had with your family in which they insisted they excluded you allegedly for your own benefit is an act of denial on their part; they\u2019re gaslighting you. Extremely upsetting behaviour and you were right to remove yourself from that situation. \n\nJust be careful and make sure you take some time to really ruminate on what you want from your family relationships. I have an extremely fractured family with a convoluted history of financial and emotional abuse and denial, a truly toxic environment to have been raised in, and now swathes of us don\u2019t talk. I haven\u2019t spoken to my mother in nearly four years and while she engaged in the same gaslighting behaviour and made me hate myself, the fact that that wound is still open and that too much time has passed between us for it to feel normal to speak again hurts me every day. Don\u2019t be too quick to say that your relationship with your family is over. I hate myself a little for saying this but if you cut yourself off because you\u2019re hurt now, it might hurt more later. \n\nThat said, protect yourself and don\u2019t allow this to pass without resolution. You are owed an apology and an explanation, not only for the act of their exclusion but for their ridiculous and hurtful reaction both to you confronting them and to you understandably venting to an online community. You are not remotely in the wrong here. It might be helpful to speak instead to a few of your family members separately as it seems they\u2019ve ganged up against you as a group which leaves you in a vulnerable position and doesn\u2019t allow your voice to be heard. \n\nI hope your situation improves and that you can come out of this happier and with a healthier family support network, but if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not your fault.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This was genuinely painful to read and I\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you. I think at this time you could benefit from some time away from your family to heal and to rest from all of this drama. The conversation you had with your family in which they insisted they excluded you allegedly for your own benefit is an act of denial on their part; they\u2019re gaslighting you. Extremely upsetting behaviour and you were right to remove yourself from that situation. </p>\n\n<p>Just be careful and make sure you take some time to really ruminate on what you want from your family relationships. I have an extremely fractured family with a convoluted history of financial and emotional abuse and denial, a truly toxic environment to have been raised in, and now swathes of us don\u2019t talk. I haven\u2019t spoken to my mother in nearly four years and while she engaged in the same gaslighting behaviour and made me hate myself, the fact that that wound is still open and that too much time has passed between us for it to feel normal to speak again hurts me every day.

And its the \u201cactual reason of the post\u201d which they might be claiming to be false or overexgerrated (for example, family did apologize and OP insulted them and the shouting match began).</p>\n\n<p>Again, in OP\u2019s case, I dont think he is lying and I do think they owe him an apology. But, <em>in general</em>, a family member recognizing the surrounding details of story doesnt automically\nmean the entire story is true.</p>\n</div>",

The only spell that was relatively safe, but even then a little sketch, was Bed of Iron since it just lets you sleep in your armor and not be fatigued. I made that very clear to everyone in the beginning of the game, that it was the ultimate evil thing and while I wasn't banning it, it should be done in the privacy of your own home. One of the players was from a minor noble house that was part of an international paladin order to foster cooperation and combat the great threat, so it's not like I wasn't clear. \n\nKnowing this, he chose to do necromancy like \"Death Knell\" in front of people who have trained their entire lives to combat it. I didn't want his character to die though, so I gave the zealot a perception check in the first place to notice he was casting a spell, even though she was adjacent to him on the grid. She passed. So I gave her a spellcraft, they passed, and they confronted him. His character was unapologetic, tried to force the spell onto the bleeding out creature, and he got hit for like 6 damage at like level 3. Again, I didn't want to kill his character. Her characterization probably would have had her deliver a field execution, but the aforementioned other player's paladin character interceded (with great relief from me) that he'd take him under his wing and show him right from wrong. She left it up to him and left the group to pursue other endeavors as she was only meant to be introduced so they knew her for later plots. \n\nHis post contained exaggerations saying she nearly cut off his arm, called the Paladin player Lawful Stupid, called the NPC a GMPC (which was rich coming from him, all of his NPCs outshone everyone in his games). Pretty much anything you could think of to insult the game, me, and my other players. He did his best to try to include everything.  \n\nHe made a big stink about it, but nobody on the pathfinder sub sided with him even with his misrepresentations. That was a pretty hardcore schadenfreude when I found it and he deleted the post after I confronted him. \n\nIn hindsight, I should have just banned necromancy spells full stop. I should have known that someone would pick it to get that sweet, hardcore edge going on, but I was young and naive. ",
