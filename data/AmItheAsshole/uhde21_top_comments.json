When I was 10 - I was a &#39;junior&#39; bridesmaid for my cousin (we&#39;re about 14 years apart) and I had to wear a long, pink dress with a shawl and a pink flowered thing on my head. I hated it, and I still won&#39;t wear pink. I&#39;m 54. This is your day ; and you are one of the few brides on this site that aren&#39;t trying to bully people. Don&#39;t let these people bully you and this teenager.</p>\n</div>",

I'm a trans dude and was in the niece's situation twice. \n\nWhen I was like 11, my step-sister was engaged and begged me to be a bridesmaid and wear a dress, I was uncomfortable but agreed because I didn't really know how to stand up for myself yet. Wedding got canceled in the end, but a decade later she was actually getting married and tried to hold me to my promise. I'd been out as a trans guy for like 4 years at that point, but she'd gotten a lot more conservative over the years and threw a massive fit that I \"wouldn't just be a girl for [her] for one tiny day!\" Kicked me out of the bridal party (good, I didn't want to be in it anyway), but still went around crying about how all her ~sisters~ wouldn't be there to support her. So ridiculous.\n\nMy *mom's* wedding was a couple years beforehand, and the first time we even talked about clothes for it she just casually went \"you're definitely not getting into a dress, right? yeah, okay, no problem, let's figure out if you want a suit jacket or a vest.\" Made sure not to include me in any 'woman things' except helping her and the bridal party girls get ready, but that was more because I was my baby sister's favorite and it was easiest for me to be the one wrangling her since I didn't need to have makeup done lol. She *apologized* to me for having me put concealer on to cover a little bruise on my face from our dog getting overexcited the day before, made it *very* clear she wasn't doing it to make me seem feminine, and *still* waited for me say I was okay with it before *she* did it for me, because she didn't want me to be uncomfortable with their makeup artist. \n\nLike, my step-sister who I'd barely spoken to for half a decade was a hundred times more ripshit about her ~dream wedding party~ being messed up, when I'm sure my mom had thought about me being dressed up nice for her wedding for *much longer* and switched tracks immediately when I came out.

It was a beach wedding, so the groom and groomsmen were in khakis and white button-downs. Man of Honor wore khakis and a button-down in the same color as the bridesmaid dresses (lilac). Also of note: the groom&#39;s daughters stood on his side and wore khaki colored dresses. </p>\n\n<p>The whole wedding was gorgeous, color-coordinated, and lots of fun for all involved. If anyone had a problem with mixed-gender wedding parties, I never heard about it.</p>\n</div>",
