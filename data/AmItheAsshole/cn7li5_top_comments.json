Your parents are pissed about what? A teenage girl wanting to hookup? Newsflash - that\u2019s how life goes. It\u2019s the job of parents to teach their children to make informed decisions for themselves. NOT YOURS. If your parents have failed to do that, then maybe they should be pissed at themselves, not your sister. I hope she nopes tf right out of there at 18 and tells you all to kick rocks.</p>\n</div>",

Underage girls seeking sex with men of age, need serious help, and not public shame from you telling all your friends about how you executed a perfect catfish plan. \nYou were right to tell your parents, and it might even be right for your parents to have catfished her, but don't pretend to be the victim when she never speaks to you again. That's understood. \nWhat she did deserved parental punishment, not punishment from her brother, the guy who should be willing to give advice and guidance when he sees that his sister is obviously going down a really bad path. \n\nWhat i'm appalled about is your lack of respect for your sister through all this. She was stupid, but you were the asshole. If she's underage she can't consent, and would only be hurting herself and (possibly) the reputation of an of age man. She's seeking attention from adult men, thats a red flag for something deeply upsetting in her life, is she experiencing depression? Bullying? Sexual assault? Loneliness? Anger at parents? How is humiliating her going to affect the underlying issue? Is it going to make her angrier at her parents now that they have humiliated her in the middle of an applebees? Is it going to make her feel lonlier now that she realized that her family knows about a horrible thing she did? Is she going to be bullied at all when her peers learn that she was lying to men to get sex, because you told all your friends? \n\nYour lack of respect for your sister is also illustrated in your exitement to parent your own sister. If you're really worried for her, then let the proper people know. Your parents rightly stepped in to parent, so why did you also need to be in charge of the \"bring sister to justice\" plan? I'm an older sibling too, but that doesn't mean I get to hold their wrongdoings over their head. I caught my little brother stealing a large amount of money from my parents, he was 16. I told all of my friends and my parents. He had been spending all his money on csgo lottery crates, and he had become addicted to online gambling to impress his friends. He did something really wrong, and i made his life worse. He's been to therapy and is getting better, and i've been working to repair our relationship. \nHim being called out publicly for something horrible he did by his parents and is own sister just made him spend more time alone, and more time spent being angry at hurt by what happened. \n\nParenting by humiliation makes a great story. It also however breaks trust. If you know this, and still want to parent this way, good for you. If you think that a relationship of mutual respect isn't important to a parent and child or sister and brother relationship, then continue to parent your own sister by choosing the punishment that would make the best story for karma on reddit.",

        "body": "What exactly is dangerous about her behavior?\n\nBest case scenario,  they meet, they click, and they go to the guys house to have consensual sex?\n\nWell what if is is lying about his identity? Suppose she stills meets/talks/eats with him, and doesn\u2019t walk away immediately. Then either they click or they don\u2019t . For all intents and purposes it carries the same risk of meeting someone on the internet who isn\u2019t lying about their identity. Anything that could happen with a catfisher can happen with someone who isn\u2019t lying about themselves on the internet. At worst, she\u2019s a little more suspicious of someone who catfished (which is a bad thing).\n\n\nWell what if they don\u2019t click? Typically the date ends there and they go one their separate ways. But we\u2019re doing worst case scenario, so let\u2019s assume he doesn\u2019t want the date end but she does. Suppose she gets some weird vibes and begins to feel uncomfortable. So she goes restroom to think. Maybe she tells another woman in the bathroom, or calls a friend, or goes up to the bar/maitre de/any random waiter(ess) and tells she feels uncomfortable and ask for help. Either way someone else is alerted to the scenario, and she goes home alone.\n\nOkay, but what if he grabs her? She screams/yells/fights and everyone in the restaurant is alerted. Basically the same scenario as above.\n\nWhat if he has a gun? And won\u2019t let her go to the restroom? Okay yeah, I\u2019ll give you that one. I can\u2019t see anyway out of a gun scenario. Guns are dangerous weapons. \n\nBut what if he spikes her drink? Okay, let\u2019s suppose she leaves her drink unattended and he slips something in.  The vast majority of date rate drugs are fast-acting, and people don\u2019t drink unattended drinks at the end of the date, so the date rate drugs would kick in before they leaves. I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019s wearing heels because it\u2019s a classy restaurant. Well date rape drugs make your disoriented and clumsy, so she\u2019s probably going to fall and slur her words. Of course, someone could just assume she\u2019s drunk, but she\u2019s 19 and hopefully hasn\u2019t had any alcohol and the waiter would notice. Or she might starting fighting/yelling or she could call 911. Or she could straight up pass out on the ground. \n\nIdeally, she would have a friend near by or tell the staff that she shouldn\u2019t leave with him unless she gives the okay. But she may not have known to do so, because this isn\u2019t common practice or at least I don\u2019t believe it is. \n\nBut what happens if they leave together and she changes her mind? The sad fact is when she\u2019s alone with a perpetrator, it becomes much harder to get out of a rape scenario. Of course, this is true regardless of how long they\u2019ve known each other and has nothing do with them being romantic. It could be a friend, a coworker, or a boss. \n\nIn 93% of juvenile rape cases are committed by someone known to the victim [Source](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens) . 8 of 10 rape cases, the victim knew the assaulter [Source](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf).  55% that occur at or around the victim\u2019s house vs 15% that occurred in some public place like the street or a park or in \u201cother\u201d locations [Source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf).\n\nThe fact is if she is going to be raped, it\u2019s most likely going to be by someone she knows, not a stranger. The OP was TA and clearly wasn\u2019t acting in his sisters best interest.",
