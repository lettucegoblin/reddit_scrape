It sounds like you have one of those guys who is completely tied to his mama other than he can't have sex with her, so he has you for that and only that. The fact that you've left and he still doesn't see the problem tells me there's likely no saving this marriage, at least in any form that is good for you. Let your family take care of you and spend some time thinking about how to go forward. If you do try to save your marriage, make his mom going home and marriage counseling a requirement for your return. But any success for the future depends on him wanting it.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. For better or worse, men often show us who they really are once we&#39;ve had a child. You definitely have the worse version. It sounds like you have one of those guys who is completely tied to his mama other than he can&#39;t have sex with her, so he has you for that and only that. The fact that you&#39;ve left and he still doesn&#39;t see the problem tells me there&#39;s likely no saving this marriage, at least in any form that is good for you. Let your family take care of you and spend some time thinking about how to go forward. If you do try to save your marriage, make his mom going home and marriage counseling a requirement for your return. But any success for the future depends on him wanting it.</p>\n</div>",

Your husband needs an urgent wake up call and hopefully you leaving has done that. I would not agree to go back until he agrees to very clear and specific boundaries with his mother and is willing to support you in being a parent.

There's a reason he hates your mother, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's an attempt to alienate you from your safety network. His mum comes before you, his hate for your mother comes before his own son, his own comfort comes before caring for his family. \n\nUnfortunately it often happens that someone shows their true colours when they have a child. Your husband sounds emotionally abusive, but also like he could get physically abusive (if he isn't already). Don't subject your child to this person if you can't be certain of safety and care for either of you.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>OMG OP I don&#39;t want to jump on the &#39;divorce and run&#39; bandwagon but you definitely need to look at your relationship with your husband <em>and</em> his relationship with everyone else, this time with open eyes. There&#39;s a reason he hates your mother, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s an attempt to alienate you from your safety network. His mum comes before you, his hate for your mother comes before his own son, his own comfort comes before caring for his family. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it often happens that someone shows their true colours when they have a child. Your husband sounds emotionally abusive, but also like he could get physically abusive (if he isn&#39;t already). Don&#39;t subject your child to this person if you can&#39;t be certain of safety and care for either of you.</p>\n</div>",
