        "body": "Even if this genetic trait didn\u2019t skip a generation, most traits are the combination of a long genetic sequence, where in each individual component of the sequence needs to be turned on or off. Ex: two very short people have a very tall child. It\u2019s not necessarily the case that mom was cheating with a basketball player. Random chance could also dictate that the majority of the genetic markers for height were activated out of the total combined markers for height of the X and Y (or X and X) chromosomes.\n\nSame thing goes with race. This is presumably either a mixed race or at least not both white couple. With fraternal triplets it\u2019s extremely likely that the kids all have different combinations of the existing combinations of genetic markers for melanin. One comes out darker than either of the parents?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Even if this genetic trait didn\u2019t skip a generation, most traits are the combination of a long genetic sequence, where in each individual component of the sequence needs to be turned on or off. Ex: two very short people have a very tall child. It\u2019s not necessarily the case that mom was cheating with a basketball player. Random chance could also dictate that the majority of the genetic markers for height were activated out of the total combined markers for height of the X and Y (or X and X) chromosomes.</p>\n\n<p>Same thing goes with race.
