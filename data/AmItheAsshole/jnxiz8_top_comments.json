She was planning on riding her bike back to the other apartment with the clothes flung over her back... She was pissed when her bike wouldn't move.

Lol. \n\nI wanted to pop her tires, but I knew I could get in trouble for destruction of property, so I took the knowledge I had from fixing my own bikes as a kid and made hers temporarily immovable. I don't know if she ever figured it out lol! All I know is a few years later she got put in jail for drug charges and her mug shot made me a little sad. Every ounce of beauty she once had was replaced with bags, wrinkles, and sores and her eyes were dead. \n\nDon't do drugs, kids.",
