Not everything is resolved here so I'm not making a final update yet. It was suggested I save that until I know things are resolved. But here's a comment to update everyone who has been asking for once since my first post.**\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 My sister did confront our parents about them selling the house. They tried playing dumb, asking her what she meant, but went quiet after she told them she knew they did and texted them the picture I sent her of the contract I signed when buying the lake house, proving I owned the place.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Sister was furious and said they lied to her about who owned the house and let her look like a lunatic. They went in circles, saying they definitely told her about it but she must have forgotten since she was so focused on her first year of college, but my sister's adamant that she wouldn't forget about something as big as them selling a whole house.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Sister called me back the next day and asked if we could talk. She said she felt like she didn't know what was the truth anymore (didn't blame her) so we sat and talked for what felt like hours. We hadn't talked that long since we were kids. It was sorta nice at some parts. But it was also upsetting in more parts because it shed some nasty light on a lot of stuff from our childhoods.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 She asked how much they sold the house for, I told her (close to 100k), and she said that didn't add up. According to her, all four years of her tuition cost just under 50k. She revealed that she had to get a job and rent an apartment with a friend to be able to afford living by her school. Which shocked me and I told her how our parents told me they paid for everything for her; books, groceries, her apartment, etc. That means there's about $50,000 from the sale of the house that's currently unaccounted for.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 She did apologize for being rude to me the other day. She said she hadn't known about me owning my house and wouldn't have acted that way if she'd known I actually bought it. Our parents made it seem like they were just letting me live there for free out of the kindness of their hearts. And she felt jealous that I got to live rent free in a vacation home while she was busting her ass to make a name for herself in her field after 4 years of college on top of having a crappy minimum wage job. She felt bitter because she felt like I always ruined things for her.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 I asked her what she meant by that and it turns out our parents were blaming me for stuff behind my back to my sister for... practically our entire lives. Like the time they pulled her out of ballet class when she was 7. They told her it was supposedly because they had to pay for my glasses and couldn't afford the classes on top of that. Or when they wouldn't pay for her to join girl scouts with her friends, they said it was because I needed braces and that was more important than girl scouts. But I told her that dad's insurance had paid for both of those. So it sounds like they just didn't want to pay for her classes/girl scouts. And decided I was a nice clueless patsy to use so their precious baby girl wouldn't hate them.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 I've gone NC with parents. Not sure if Sis is as well. I sent them one text saying after this I don't think I can stomach speaking to them for a very long time, if ever again. And if they have any respect for me they'll not try to contact me. Then I blocked their number and also blocked them on everything I could think of.\r  \n\r  \nThere is so much more but I don't want this comment to get too long. Any questions you guys have I'll try my best to answer them. But things are still happening. \r  \n\r  \n**tl;dr my parents have been using me as the scapegoat for pretty much everything they did that upset my sister since we were kids.**",

To realize that they are at the point that they are selling off property likely prompts the thought of what else they don't actually own. Your sister is probably just now realizing that there is no inheritance to be had because your parents are spending all they have (and then some) on your sister.

If it's really that important to her, she should have a very small wedding now, ask guests/family to donate to her honeymoon fund, have her actual honeymoon a few months after, and plan to have her \"dream\" wedding in a few years as a vow renewal. That's the financially responsible plan for those who are still getting started in life and still insist on having a big wedding. Bonus, if the relationship doesn't last the few years (statistics being what they are), each person exits the marriage with a little cushion.

Just gross.\n\n There are so many of these situations in this sub and I really don't understand how these things get decided without asking the person who it'll mostly affect. How do your parents and sister just assume it'll be ok and not have brought it up with you. Even if you agreed, you would need to make accommodations so how could they think keeping you in the dark was the best way to go about it? And your sister to not even confirm with you that you were ok with it or if your parents had told her you agreed to it to not reach out and thank you. \n\nIt's not your responsibility to help make a honeymoon for them happen because it's not in their budget. They can postpone their honeymoon until they're more financially ready.",

Like if she changes her behavior and apologize, you should have a sit down with your parents and her and talk about their behavior and how it\u2019s going to effect them in the future and your sisters future once your parents are gone. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d also make it known to your sister you will not be there for her like your parents have been, once they\u2019re gone as she\u2019s not your liability. She shouldn\u2019t even be their liability now.</p>\n</div>",

My house used to belong to my parents. But they sold it to me in 2017. It had been a family vacation home of sorts. Every couple years when my grandparents were alive they'd invite us kids up there for a week. Fast forward to the end of 2016. My sister got accepted to her dream college. Wont say which but it's a big one. Everyone was excited and proud of her, me too. But a week after that my parents called asking if I'd found a house yet.\n\nI was looking for one and my family knew it. I'd been saving up since I started my first job at 20. I said no so my dad suggested I buy the lake house from them. I asked why they wanted to sell it. Turns out sis didn't have any savings for college and didn't get some scholarship like she'd planned? And our parents couldn't afford to pay for everything either. I asked why she didn't get student loans and they said they didn't want her ruining her credit. So their solution was to sell the lake house and use the money from that to finance her college.\n\nI had lots of good memories from the lake house so eventually I agreed. I work via computer so after getting a good internet connection out there I moved right in, and been there since. My gf moved in permanently last year before lockdown and it's been pretty blissful.\n\n2019 my sister & her college bf got engaged. Parents agreed to pay for her wedding. But like with every other wedding around then things got set back. Sis had to postpone her wedding until this year. She plans to have it in Dec. I even agreed to be in the bridal party.\n\nIssues came up recently when my sis asked where I was going to stay for the 2 weeks after her wedding? Puzzled I answered my house? She got a sour look and said that wouldn't work, her and fiance would be there and they wanted private time. I asked why they'd be at my house and she said that's where they were having their honeymoon. Two weeks alone at a lake house. I said that was news to me. She insisted our parents said it was fine. But I said it wasn't their place to make decisions about my house.\n\nAfter arguing she called our parents who said I was being unreasonable. I said I didn't want my sister and her fiance christening their new union by fucking in my house. They said I was being gross and selfish. I said no again so sis threatened to remove me from the bridal party. I just shrugged and said okay. She starts crying, saying she already couldn't have her dream wedding like she wanted and now I was trying to ruin her honeymoon too. I told her to rent a hotel room like every other newlywed couple then hung up.\n\nShe's not speaking to me and I'm uninvited to the wedding. Our parents keep calling me and saying I should do this for her since her wedding is only 1/3 what she wanted it to be. But I'm not comfortable with them staying unsupervised at my house. They're making me feel like a monster for saying no. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First and foremost, anyone who has ever stayed at that house in the past couple of generations needs to be informed, in no uncertain terms, that you have bought the house from your parents. You are not renting it or staying there rent free. The house is no longer available as a family vacation spot. They need to be told not to assume they can use the place and need to ask you if they want to visit. You have the right to say NO. Next you need to change all locks and send them another message saying any keys they may have kept will not open the door or any building on the property. It should go without saying that nobody in your family can be trusted to keep an \"emergency\" key. Third, get security cameras and a security service if you don't already have it. Inform the company that your family specifically might be trouble and they are not to listen to anyone but you or your gf. I hope your sister has seen the error of her ways and is now angry at the people she should be angry at - your parents. They caused this by letting her believe they were still in control of the house. If they had sold to a stranger, would they now be on the stranger's doorstep demanding to use the place for her honeymoon? No? Then why are they harassing you? They are the ones being unreasonable and gross. Why would you let your sister come into your house, and probably your bed, to consummate her marriage? Ew! I'm sorry you have such a shitty family and hope this all blows over. I also hope you come back and give us updates. Good luck.",

I spoke to my sister like a few people suggested and asked her if she knew the lake house was legally MY house. As in, I bought it years ago.\n\nShe was NOT in fact aware of this. She was under the impression from our parents that they were letting me live there rent free...... I corrected her and even showed her proof that they sold the house to me. And when she asked why they sold it I was honest and said it was to pay for her college tuition/lifestyle. She became quiet after that and we soon hung up.\n\nNo idea what's going to happen now.\n\nShit went down after my original post and I couldn't find time to make any new edits before I received judgement. Not everything is resolved here so I'm not making a final update yet. It was suggested I save that until I know things are resolved. But here's a comment to update everyone who has been asking for once since my first post.\n\n\u2022 My sister did confront our parents about them selling the house. They tried playing dumb, asking her what she meant, but went quiet after she told them she knew they did and texted them the picture I sent her of the contract I signed when buying the lake house, proving I owned the place.\n\n\u2022 Sister was furious and said they lied to her about who owned the house and let her look like a lunatic. They went in circles, saying they definitely told her about it but she must have forgotten since she was so focused on her first year of college, but my sister's adamant that she wouldn't forget about something as big as them selling a whole house.\n\n\u2022 Sister called me back the next day and asked if we could talk. She said she felt like she didn't know what was the truth anymore (didn't blame her) so we sat and talked for what felt like hours. We hadn't talked that long since we were kids. It was sorta nice at some parts. But it was also upsetting in more parts because it shed some nasty light on a lot of stuff from our childhoods.\n\n\u2022 She asked how much they sold the house for, I told her (close to 100k), and she said that didn't add up. According to her, all four years of her tuition cost just under 50k. She revealed that she had to get a job and rent an apartment with a friend to be able to afford living by her school. Which shocked me and I told her how our parents told me they paid for everything for her; books, groceries, her apartment, etc. That means there's about $50,000 from the sale of the house that's currently unaccounted for.\n\n\u2022 She did apologize for being rude to me the other day. She said she hadn't known about me owning my house and wouldn't have acted that way if she'd known I actually bought it. Our parents made it seem like they were just letting me live there for free out of the kindness of their hearts. And she felt jealous that I got to live rent free in a vacation home while she was busting her ass to make a name for herself in her field after 4 years of college on top of having a crappy minimum wage job. She felt bitter because she felt like I always ruined things for her.\n\n\u2022 I asked her what she meant by that and it turns out our parents were blaming me for stuff behind my back to my sister for... practically our entire lives. Like the time they pulled her out of ballet class when she was 7. They told her it was supposedly because they had to pay for my glasses and couldn't afford the classes on top of that. Or when they wouldn't pay for her to join girl scouts with her friends, they said it was because I needed braces and that was more important than girl scouts. But I told her that dad's insurance had paid for both of those. So it sounds like they just didn't want to pay for her classes/girl scouts. And decided I was a nice clueless patsy to use so their precious baby girl wouldn't hate them.\n\n\u2022 I've gone NC with parents. Not sure if Sis is as well. I sent them one text saying after this I don't think I can stomach speaking to them for a very long time, if ever again. And if they have any respect for me they'll not try to contact me. Then I blocked their number and also blocked them on everything I could think of.\n\nThere is so much more but I don't want this comment to get too long. Any questions you guys have I'll try my best to answer them. But things are still happening.\n\ntl;dr my parents have been using me as the scapegoat for pretty much everything they did that upset my sister since we were kids.\n\nu/Father-Son-HolyToast found some more info buried in the comments about the sister stealing from OP as kids:\n\nOP hinted at it with this comment in the first post:\n\nI wouldn't have let her stay unsupervised (there's a reason) at my house for for any amount of time anyways. I would have considered letting her VISIT while I was still there. But no, there's no way I'd have let her use my house while I'm away.\n\nPeople were like... uh, hol' up, what now? What reasons? And OP explained it this way:\n\nUp until I moved out of our parents house my sister was constantly stealing my things. It started when we were kids (toys), and continued into middle school (video games), and then into high school (electronics). I couldn't keep anything to myself if she wanted it. I had to hide any snacks I bought and god forbid I buy a t-shirt or jacket she liked. It would go missing soon after she saw it. Our parents never did anything about it (\"siblings should always share!\"). And like I know we're both older and there's a chance she grew out of her theft phase but I still don't want her in my house unsupervised. Years of having my things stolen doesn't disappear cuz I'm living on my own.\n\nIn the update post, when people asked about the stealing and if OP raised that issue with their sister, this was what OP had to say:\n\nI did actually. She seemed really uncomfortable with the topic of her theft but I told her I felt like I deserved to know why she did that to me over and over when we lived together. She eventually broke down and admitted that at first it was because of her being mad at me for 'ruining things' for her. So she wanted to upset me like she'd been upset. But then she said our parents didn't really punish her, they didn't care and acted like it didn't matter so she just kept taking my stuff. I told her that regardless of her reasons for taking my stuff, the theft was a major reason why I didn't want her in my house without me or my gf there. She said if it helps at all, she doesn't steal anymore. Not since her second year of college. She told me she got a taste of her own medicine but wouldn't specify how. I think whatever it was it was embarrassing for her. I'm really curious what happened but we're still trying to get to know each other again so I don't want to pry and come off as nosy.",

She became quiet after that and we soon hung up.</p>\n\n<p>No idea what&#39;s going to happen now.</p>\n\n<p>Shit went down after my original post and I couldn&#39;t find time to make any new edits before I received judgement. Not everything is resolved here so I&#39;m not making a final update yet. It was suggested I save that until I know things are resolved. But here&#39;s a comment to update everyone who has been asking for once since my first post.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 My sister did confront our parents about them selling the house. They tried playing dumb, asking her what she meant, but went quiet after she told them she knew they did and texted them the picture I sent her of the contract I signed when buying the lake house, proving I owned the place.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Sister was furious and said they lied to her about who owned the house and let her look like a lunatic. They went in circles, saying they definitely told her about it but she must have forgotten since she was so focused on her first year of college, but my sister&#39;s adamant that she wouldn&#39;t forget about something as big as them selling a whole house.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Sister called me back the next day and asked if we could talk. She said she felt like she didn&#39;t know what was the truth anymore (didn&#39;t blame her) so we sat and talked for what felt like hours. We hadn&#39;t talked that long since we were kids. It was sorta nice at some parts. But it was also upsetting in more parts because it shed some nasty light on a lot of stuff from our childhoods.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 She asked how much they sold the house for, I told her (close to 100k), and she said that didn&#39;t add up. According to her, all four years of her tuition cost just under 50k. She revealed that she had to get a job and rent an apartment with a friend to be able to afford living by her school. Which shocked me and I told her how our parents told me they paid for everything for her; books, groceries, her apartment, etc. That means there&#39;s about $50,000 from the sale of the house that&#39;s currently unaccounted for.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 She did apologize for being rude to me the other day. She said she hadn&#39;t known about me owning my house and wouldn&#39;t have acted that way if she&#39;d known I actually bought it. Our parents made it seem like they were just letting me live there for free out of the kindness of their hearts. And she felt jealous that I got to live rent free in a vacation home while she was busting her ass to make a name for herself in her field after 4 years of college on top of having a crappy minimum wage job. She felt bitter because she felt like I always ruined things for her.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 I asked her what she meant by that and it turns out our parents were blaming me for stuff behind my back to my sister for... practically our entire lives. Like the time they pulled her out of ballet class when she was 7. They told her it was supposedly because they had to pay for my glasses and couldn&#39;t afford the classes on top of that. Or when they wouldn&#39;t pay for her to join girl scouts with her friends, they said it was because I needed braces and that was more important than girl scouts. But I told her that dad&#39;s insurance had paid for both of those. So it sounds like they just didn&#39;t want to pay for her classes/girl scouts. And decided I was a nice clueless patsy to use so their precious baby girl wouldn&#39;t hate them.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 I&#39;ve gone NC with parents. Not sure if Sis is as well. I sent them one text saying after this I don&#39;t think I can stomach speaking to them for a very long time, if ever again. And if they have any respect for me they&#39;ll not try to contact me. Then I blocked their number and also blocked them on everything I could think of.</p>\n\n<p>There is so much more but I don&#39;t want this comment to get too long. Any questions you guys have I&#39;ll try my best to answer them. But things are still happening.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr my parents have been using me as the scapegoat for pretty much everything they did that upset my sister since we were kids.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Father-Son-HolyToast\">u/Father-Son-HolyToast</a> found some more info buried in the comments about the sister stealing from OP as kids:</p>\n\n<p>OP hinted at it with this comment in the first post:</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t have let her stay unsupervised (there&#39;s a reason) at my house for for any amount of time anyways. I would have considered letting her VISIT while I was still there. But no, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d have let her use my house while I&#39;m away.</p>\n\n<p>People were like... uh, hol&#39; up, what now? What reasons? And OP explained it this way:</p>\n\n<p>Up until I moved out of our parents house my sister was constantly stealing my things. It started when we were kids (toys), and continued into middle school (video games), and then into high school (electronics). I couldn&#39;t keep anything to myself if she wanted it. I had to hide any snacks I bought and god forbid I buy a t-shirt or jacket she liked. It would go missing soon after she saw it. Our parents never did anything about it (&quot;siblings should always share!&quot;). And like I know we&#39;re both older and there&#39;s a chance she grew out of her theft phase but I still don&#39;t want her in my house unsupervised. Years of having my things stolen doesn&#39;t disappear cuz I&#39;m living on my own.</p>\n\n<p>In the update post, when people asked about the stealing and if OP raised that issue with their sister, this was what OP had to say:</p>\n\n<p>I did actually. She seemed really uncomfortable with the topic of her theft but I told her I felt like I deserved to know why she did that to me over and over when we lived together. She eventually broke down and admitted that at first it was because of her being mad at me for &#39;ruining things&#39; for her. So she wanted to upset me like she&#39;d been upset. But then she said our parents didn&#39;t really punish her, they didn&#39;t care and acted like it didn&#39;t matter so she just kept taking my stuff. I told her that regardless of her reasons for taking my stuff, the theft was a major reason why I didn&#39;t want her in my house without me or my gf there. She said if it helps at all, she doesn&#39;t steal anymore. Not since her second year of college. She told me she got a taste of her own medicine but wouldn&#39;t specify how. I think whatever it was it was embarrassing for her. I&#39;m really curious what happened but we&#39;re still trying to get to know each other again so I don&#39;t want to pry and come off as nosy.</p>\n</div>",

Please let there be an update when you find out more information.\n\nThe idea that she would ask your parents instead of you about the house VERY strongly suggests she has no idea it\u2019s not the family vacation home any more, it\u2019s the only logical conclusion I can come to. The fact that your parents didn\u2019t correct her when she asked them suggests they themselves don\u2019t want to admit that they sold it to you and that they have no legal say over it, thus attacking you about being unreasonable and unfair. This also likely is their hopes regarding saving money on the honeymoon as \u201cthe family vacation home\u201d would obviously be free accommodation - if it were still. \n\nAlso what do your parents think happen on a honeymoon! Yeah, it\u2019s gross and no relative wants their relatives having sex in their house, and certainly not on their furniture. Why should you have to live with it because they wanted to save money on an Airbnb?

The fact that your parents didn\u2019t correct her when she asked them suggests they themselves don\u2019t want to admit that they sold it to you and that they have no legal say over it, thus attacking you about being unreasonable and unfair. This also likely is their hopes regarding saving money on the honeymoon as \u201cthe family vacation home\u201d would obviously be free accommodation - if it were still. </p>\n\n<p>Also what do your parents think happen on a honeymoon!
