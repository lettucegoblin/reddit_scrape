He cheats, and while you&#39;re still married they nudge you to the side to focus on his sidepiece because BAAAABBBEEE, then years later, complain that you didnt let them know you were pregnant?? Were they trying to &quot;justify&quot; his infidelity because well, if you were infertile, of course it was ok to shag someone else?? </p>\n\n<p>They are ALL TA, including the SIL. Block them, block them all.\nI feel for the kid, because she has lost a relationship with her Dad, and that sucks.</p>\n\n<p>As for you, move on, dont look back, and live your best life.</p>\n</div>",

During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. \n\nAbout 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to \u2018relieve\u2019 it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. \n\nI was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t. My ex\u2019s family treated me like their own, but my ex\u2019s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn\u2019t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. \n\nPeople thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn\u2019t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. \n\nFast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn\u2019t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. \n\nHowever, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn\u2019t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex\u2019s fault. He took a paternity test. \n\nThe poor baby girl was NEVER my ex\u2019s. The coworker apparently was dating this \u2018terrible\u2019 guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn\u2019t know who the child\u2019s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he\u2019d be the best father for her child. \n\nNow my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He\u2019s doing pretty bad now and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty like I should\u2019ve told him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A persons fertility level can vary hugely during their life. Things like stress and being unhealthy can really affect fertility. OP wasn\u2019t to know the exact reasons that she didn\u2019t get pregnant with her ex. Even if somehow she was to magically know that it was 100% due to the ex and there was no chance he was this little girls father, it wouldn\u2019t be good to get involved and potentially destroy the girls world \u2018just coz\u2019. </p>\n\n<p>I like how you talk about the other girl, sounds like you really care about her and her wellbeing. That\u2019s so nice to hear when she would represent a rift in your previous relationship, but you could see past that.</p>\n\n<p>I agree I think the ex is lashing out because he\u2019s hurt and trying to blame whoever he can. You put up with enough bs during your relationship, don\u2019t let him pile anything else on you. \nNTA, enjoy your baby with your new partner!</p>\n</div>",
