You\u2019ve done them a massive favour, they asked to stay with you in an apartment they knew was 1-bed and had the kitchen attached to the living room and they\u2019re complaining because they don\u2019t have any privacy? I have a solution for them: get their own place! It\u2019ll come with all the privacy they want. I reckon they\u2019re trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible for you so that you\u2019ll get fed up and offer them your bedroom.

It's a bucket list thing to tell people that family is more than blood and you should be accepted regardless of your sexuality. What follows is some mom talk, so stop reading if not interested....\n\n\n\n\nIt hurts to see what you consider your last family be so disrespectful of your space. It's time for a family sit down, preferably in your living room, to establish their timeline for finding a place by month end (or sooner if you need). Let them know that the environment you are all living in right now is no longer acceptable for any of you.
