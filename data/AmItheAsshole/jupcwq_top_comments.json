It never mattered... sometimes they would even let it slip that they knew what really happened, but that they just wanted to keep the peace.</p>\n\n<p>Now, explaining anything just makes me feel like everyone will think I\u2019m lying. Maybe it\u2019s just a holdover from when I was a kid, but hey.. if they don\u2019t know from my behavior that I wouldn\u2019t do [whatever], then they\u2019re probably not gonna believe me anyway so.. fuck it</p>\n</div>",
