Yes but any caring person would have told you 4 years ago. At least maybe you would have gotten comfortable to the idea of them having a relationship spectate from you and come to terms with her choice.  But now the feeling of hurt and betrayal from your brother, your ex and now your daughter is at the forefront of your mind. </p>\n\n<p>She played the game of, \u201cthis is how it is and you can\u2019t complain\u201d and lost. I don\u2019t think any parent ever owes their child to pay for their wedding and maybe you will regret not paying and not being there but she made her choice to lie to you and put them above you in this situation and she will have to learn to deal with the impact that has caused on the relationship between you two. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I am scorched earth when it comes to this but I wouldn\u2019t want to see my cheating ex and their affair partner at my daughters wedding either.</p>\n</div>",

Your feelings are valid.  However, the question you need to ask yourself is do you want to become estranged from your child because she formed a relationship with your estranged brother and her (blameless) cousins.  Like I said I don't blame you for being hurt.  But withdrawing financial support and refusing to come is likely to result in a permanent rift between you and your daughter.  Is this boundary worth that to you?\n\n\nEdit to reply since the thread is locked: Paying for the wedding is a cultural expectation so to my mind this is like threatening to cut off your child's college tuition because they are in contact with a relative from whom you are estranged.  I just dont think its appropriate to do that.  And attending your own child's wedding is pretty much a universal bare minimum expectation.  Where would I draw the line?  Well if she's actually trying to force reconciliation by disinviting me if I refuse to reconcile I'd probably draw it there.  But i wouldn't draw it at her simply choosing to invite someone whose presence she knows I find very upsetting.  Would I be hurt?  Sure.  Would I feel more distant from my child for a time after this?  Very likely.  Would I give a wedding toast that passive aggressively dwelled on the importance of fidelity and loyalty without ever actually calling out my brother by name? Almost definitely.  But I wouldn't be the one to make the move that severs the relationship.  A gross brother and a faithless ex aren't worth my child, even if my child is being selfish at the moment.",

Having to harbor such feelings of resentment and ostracizing yourself from your family to give place to the people who were actually at fault and hurt you, must have taken a toll on you for the last 25 years.

Not the right approach, but in itself it has good intentions.\n\nLastly, just an honest advice. Grudges, especially ones that have lasted for 25 years, take more energy from us than forgivness. I perfectly understand how much it must have hurt you at the time to be betrayed by both your girlfriend and your brother but maybe its the time to give a second chance. Both of them are probably much more different people now than what they were in their twenties. Unless they have never apologized to you or never accepted their mistake, then I guess it might be worth it to give it a try for yourself first and then for the rest of the family.

That\u2019s a perfectly reasonable boundary. I disagree with many commenters saying is been x years get over it - this is a big betrayal and not something to easily get over.\n\nI do however think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect your family to cut him out. You can\u2019t expect a parent to cut off their son at 20 for a (admittedly horrible!) act. You can expect them to not try to force reconciliation. You can expect their support of you and condemnation of his actions.\n\nI\u2019m assuming your daughter didn\u2019t go out of her way to form this relationship to hurt you - if your family regularly invites your brother and you regularly avoid attending, I\u2019m sure at many family events (thanksgiving, Christmas, birthday, etc). she has met your brother and formed an uncle/niece relationship. I understand that he hurt you, but he is her uncle and she\u2019s allowed to have a relationship with him, so long as she isn\u2019t forcing it on you.\nI would say, try to find some middle ground. It is her wedding, and she want to invite her family. If she was trying to seat you together or have him walk her down the aisle she would be the asshole. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole for inviting him. Many ex\u2019s have to see eachother at family events for the sake of their children. For example, imagine parents where one cheats on the other and they get divorced - they maybe have to see that ex and afair partner at their child\u2019s graduation, birthday, wedding, etc. It sucks! But your kid should come first. Find a reasonable way to enforce your boundary (ignore your brother, sit separate, etc), without hurting your child on her wedding day.\n\nAs for paying for the wedding without attending? Meh - I don\u2019t think any parent owes their child paying for the wedding. It is rude to use it as a way to influence her guest list. But I\u2019d say your attendance is much more important for your relationship with your daughter.",

So she goes behind your back to have a relationship with your brother. That's her right, she's an adult. What she doesn't have a right to do is to force you to see him, which is what she's doing here. AND she knew your hard boundary on it. SHE gave YOU the ultimatum, reconnect with your brother or you can't come to my wedding, an event I'm sure every father wants attend for his daughter. She didn't say it in those words, that would make her actually the asshole, but she knew your options were to either not go to the wedding or make nice with him. It's an emotional time for the father of the bride, do you want to miss that? Would you miss that chance? Let's test it by inviting the brother.
