My dad was making something with peppers, and would throw in a couple chilli peppers or something, but they\u2019re super spicy and really good. They look the exact same as the sweet peppers. My friends mom walks on in and grabs a pepper... it just so happened to be a spicy one... and she just also so happened to hate spice so much, she\u2019d put cinnamon in EVERYTHING to make it sweeter (don\u2019t ask why, I don\u2019t even know). Then later also wanted to feed my cat treats, and picked up a random tin container with cat paws on it... didn\u2019t ask if she could give the cat treats, didn\u2019t ask where the treats were, just guessed. She couldn\u2019t get the container open, and hands it to my mom to open. My mom broke the awful truth that they weren\u2019t treats, but in fact, my other cats ashes. You bet she stopped being nosy after that. My family and I thought it was really funny though, so it was all good.",

Like girl, you came unannounced, and never taught your kid manners. \nLess intense of a story, but one of my friends and her parents her over for dinner. My dad was making something with peppers, and would throw in a couple chilli peppers or something, but they\u2019re super spicy and really good. They look the exact same as the sweet peppers. My friends mom walks on in and grabs a pepper... it just so happened to be a spicy one... and she just also so happened to hate spice so much, she\u2019d put cinnamon in EVERYTHING to make it sweeter (don\u2019t ask why, I don\u2019t even know). Then later also wanted to feed my cat treats, and picked up a random tin container with cat paws on it... didn\u2019t ask if she could give the cat treats, didn\u2019t ask where the treats were, just guessed. She couldn\u2019t get the container open, and hands it to my mom to open. My mom broke the awful truth that they weren\u2019t treats, but in fact, my other cats ashes. You bet she stopped being nosy after that. My family and I thought it was really funny though, so it was all good.</p>\n</div>",

I find it instantly rude to just randomly show up at someones house unannounced, it\u2019s even more rude to chew someone out for not putting away pot cookies when said person had no idea a child would randomly be at their house. I also find it odd that your niece hasn\u2019t been taught to not just grab things without asking. Even when I was her age I wouldn\u2019t just grab other people\u2019s items/food without asking.</p>\n</div>",
