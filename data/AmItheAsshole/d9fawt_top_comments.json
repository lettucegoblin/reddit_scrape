Let me share a little story.\n\nMy parents divorced about 9 years ago. I was 12 at the time, and since the divorce was not a very smooth one, I actually suffered quite a lot. There was a time I did not see my father very often, and neither did my little brother (let\u2019s call him Sam) who is three years younger than me. \n\nSam has not spoken to his father for 2 years now.  In the years we did not see our father that often, our mother had free reign to mold our view of him to whatever she wanted it to be. She used to tell us how he was a terrible father, did a lot of things that hurt us all very much, and even made us send him messages stating we did not want to see him ever again.\n\nNote that we were quite a bit younger at the time, so we were pretty easily manipulated. Luckily I was old enough to see what my mother was doing after a while, but Sam never really got it. \n\nI just want you to realise that your son spending a lot of time with your ex might mean his perception of you might have changed, since it seems like you had a pretty rough divorce. While I do realise he is an adult and should act like one, being constantly manipulated and told how bad your father is may have some impact on your sons perception of you. I am not saying this is happening for sure, but it might explain some of your sons behaviout.\n\nIf this is what is happening you\u2019re NTA, but neither is your son - it would be your ex.",

Me at 22 is completely different than me now. On top of that, finding out about an affair then having your entire family dynamic change is going to have a huge impact on your life no matter how old you are. \n\nI also dealt with a similar situation. \n\nMy father cheated on my mother when I was young, then moved thousands of miles away and started a new family. \n\nMy mom remarried twice and my second stepfather was in my life up until I was 22, when my mother cheated on him. \n\nThe time was incredibly stressful for all of us and we all changed. My mother and I were never close but I was close to my stepfather, close enough to have him walk me down the isle someday. \n\nBut the divorce changed us all. \n\nI reconnected with my biological father, and started trying to heal some of the thing I went through.

A boy doesn\u2019t just choose a mostly absent biological father over the father that raised him arbitrarily.  There are of course 22 years of history between the two of you that are impossible to include in a reddit post.  He might be going through some sort of trauma or resentment from the recent biological revelations.  Or he could have a deeper seated damage to his relationship with you that goes back further in his childhood.  Or he could just be sort of an asshole himself (or just in a phase of his life where he\u2019s been surrounding himself with assholes and it\u2019s influencing him.)  Or this bio-dad is just genuinely a great guy.  Or bio-dad showed up in his life at the perfect moment to be a needed role model when you weren\u2019t there.  Or it could be a combination of these things; or it could be something completely different.  \n\nProblem is that you haven\u2019t actually asked the kid about it directly.  If you want to know what\u2019s really going on in his head, you OF COURSE have to have a real conversation and ask him first, you can\u2019t just assume you know his motivations.  Even worse, it sounds like you\u2019ve had this conversation but only wanted to focus on your emotional needs and didn\u2019t even bother to ask him why; instead you just \u201casked\u201d/told him to be a closer son like he used to be.  \n\n The fact you\u2019re coming here for validation over how you\u2019ve reacted to the parentage situation before you\u2019ve gotten the courage to have an emotionally vulnerable moment with your son is, to me, a major red flag that maybe you HAVEN\u2019T been having these important conversations throughout his life with him; moments where you ask his opinion and really listen and value his answers instead of teaching him why your opinion is the better one.  That\u2019s what \u201cdoing the work\u201d means on parenting.  Not food and shelter.  No child will be thankful for those basic necessities their parent sacrifices to provide, and that\u2019s the legal minimum requirements of childcare, not real parenting.  Real parenting happens in the moments in his childhood when your son needed you to be an emotionally vulnerable dad and not talk to him but instead just listen and empathize - were your vulnerable and available to your son in those moments?  Did you notice them as they happened? or did they sneak past you?\n\nSo if his genuine reason is because you\u2019ve had a strained relationship his entire adolescence  because he never felt like you took his opinions seriously, and he thinks you\u2019re sort of an asshole as a result, don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t react, just listen to his perspective and accept it fully.  His words have consequences, but of course, the words exchanged for the past 22 years that have been the foundation of your father-son relationship have consequences too.  I could be totally wrong here also, but it\u2019s just one more possibility for you to consider.",

Real parenting happens in the moments in his childhood when your son needed you to be an emotionally vulnerable dad and not talk to him but instead just listen and empathize - were your vulnerable and available to your son in those moments?  Did you notice them as they happened? or did they sneak past you?</p>\n\n<p>So if his genuine reason is because you\u2019ve had a strained relationship his entire adolescence  because he never felt like you took his opinions seriously, and he thinks you\u2019re sort of an asshole as a result, don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t react, just listen to his perspective and accept it fully.  His words have consequences, but of course, the words exchanged for the past 22 years that have been the foundation of your father-son relationship have consequences too.  I could be totally wrong here also, but it\u2019s just one more possibility for you to consider.</p>\n</div>",

That is okay. However, it&#39;s a dick move for him to be so cold and distant with you and make NO time for you because you raised him! You&#39;re the one who has been there for his ups and downs throughout his life. But I can see why it would upset him that you want to cut him out over it because I&#39;m sure he wants you to be supportive and happy that he is establishing a good relationship with his biological dad who can be an additional support person in his life. He may feel like your love for him was based solely on whether or not he was yours biologically, and that sucks for him.</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to be patient with your son. I hope you will be open minded and see this as an opportunity for him to have more people in his life that love him and support him. Please don&#39;t cut him out if you love him. Don&#39;t fight fire with fire.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "NAH.\n\nI was in a very similar situation to the kid in this story.  Maybe it would help to hear how things worked out for me.\n\nAt 14 my parents told me I was going to spend the weekend with a friend of the family \"Donny\" (not real name).  I had only met Donny a few times (maybe 5) in my life, usually Christmas or funerals.  Cool dude, I associated him showing up at Christmas as a sign I would get an extra gift, fingers crossed that this weekend we would go somewhere fun!  \n\nThe day Donny was going to pick me up, my parents sat me down and tried to have the \"sex talk\" with me.  After I explained that it wasn't necessary they told me that Donny was my biological father and that my Dad (We'll call him Ron) was actually my Step Dad who came into the picture when I was 18 months old.  Weird chat, not what I expected.  I'm a \"roll with the punches\" kinda guy so it didn't really upset me.\n\nI had a good time that weekend.  Met some cousins, went fishing, watched my dad (Donny) get drunk and high, drove a Ford f-250 dually home from the bar down old country roads (my first time driving on the street and my first time entering a bar) while Donny slept in the passenger seat.  He would wake up from time to time to remind me to watch the pot holes!  He dropped me off at an arcade one night and gave me $20 to spend on video games which was huge for me since I was raised kinda poor.  The thought of spending $20 at an arcade just seemed insane to me, I spent $5 and pocketed the remainder.  Overall it was a fun weekend.\n\nWhen I came home I still loved Ron but I felt like an imposter, I felt like I was in the wrong house with the wrong name and that I didn't deserve any of the time Ron gave me.  I felt a bit like a charity case.  I was worried that the time and attention Ron gave me was stealing from my younger sister and brother.  I felt pretty guilty.\n\nI considered changing my name.  It wasn't as a gesture to Donny or as an attack on Ron, I felt that my name wasn't my own and that I was using someone else's.  When I told people my name I felt a bit like I was lying since it wasn't an honest reflection of my paternal lineage.  I never told Ron I wanted to change my name.  When I told Donny he said he would pay the associated fees.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to do it and I never did.  I was 22 or 23 when I determined that I was Ron's son.  \n\nWhat really drove it home for me was this.  I am pretty critical and naturally pick things apart.  Every time I looked back on my childhood both pre and post 14, all the interactions with Ron with and without my sister and brother, I could never identify even a single case where I was treated as anything less than his son or any different than my siblings.  I was not an easy kid, Ron put in lots of time and effort that I'm sure was difficult for him.  Ron might not have been the one to get mom pregnant but in every other facet of my life he was my Dad.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NAH.</p>\n\n<p>I was in a very similar situation to the kid in this story.  Maybe it would help to hear how things worked out for me.</p>\n\n<p>At 14 my parents told me I was going to spend the weekend with a friend of the family &quot;Donny&quot; (not real name).  I had only met Donny a few times (maybe 5) in my life, usually Christmas or funerals.  Cool dude, I associated him showing up at Christmas as a sign I would get an extra gift, fingers crossed that this weekend we would go somewhere fun!  </p>\n\n<p>The day Donny was going to pick me up, my parents sat me down and tried to have the &quot;sex talk&quot; with me.  After I explained that it wasn&#39;t necessary they told me that Donny was my biological father and that my Dad (We&#39;ll call him Ron) was actually my Step Dad who came into the picture when I was 18 months old.  Weird chat, not what I expected.  I&#39;m a &quot;roll with the punches&quot; kinda guy so it didn&#39;t really upset me.</p>\n\n<p>I had a good time that weekend.  Met some cousins, went fishing, watched my dad (Donny) get drunk and high, drove a Ford f-250 dually home from the bar down old country roads (my first time driving on the street and my first time entering a bar) while Donny slept in the passenger seat.  He would wake up from time to time to remind me to watch the pot holes!  He dropped me off at an arcade one night and gave me $20 to spend on video games which was huge for me since I was raised kinda poor.  The thought of spending $20 at an arcade just seemed insane to me, I spent $5 and pocketed the remainder.  Overall it was a fun weekend.</p>\n\n<p>When I came home I still loved Ron but I felt like an imposter, I felt like I was in the wrong house with the wrong name and that I didn&#39;t deserve any of the time Ron gave me.  I felt a bit like a charity case.  I was worried that the time and attention Ron gave me was stealing from my younger sister and brother.  I felt pretty guilty.</p>\n\n<p>I considered changing my name.  It wasn&#39;t as a gesture to Donny or as an attack on Ron, I felt that my name wasn&#39;t my own and that I was using someone else&#39;s.  When I told people my name I felt a bit like I was lying since it wasn&#39;t an honest reflection of my paternal lineage.  I never told Ron I wanted to change my name.  When I told Donny he said he would pay the associated fees.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it and I never did.  I was 22 or 23 when I determined that I was Ron&#39;s son.  </p>\n\n<p>What really drove it home for me was this.  I am pretty critical and naturally pick things apart.  Every time I looked back on my childhood both pre and post 14, all the interactions with Ron with and without my sister and brother, I could never identify even a single case where I was treated as anything less than his son or any different than my siblings.  I was not an easy kid, Ron put in lots of time and effort that I&#39;m sure was difficult for him.  Ron might not have been the one to get mom pregnant but in every other facet of my life he was my Dad.  I couldn&#39;t have been raised by a more caring man.</p>\n\n<p>For reasons not important in this discussion I did have to legally change my name about 5 years later (turns out I didn&#39;t legally have Ron&#39;s last name after all)!

The \u201cnew father\u201d is definitely more attractive for sure, he doesn\u2019t bug you about your education, he doesn\u2019t get mad at you when you do stupid shit, he seems \u2018cool\u2019 like a friend and take you places that your \u2018old man\u2019 couldn\u2019t BECAUSE HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF TO RAISE YOU and didn\u2019t have the extra resources to do so.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is still in school and haven\u2019t had the chance of \u2018surviving\u2019 the real world via working to provide absolutely EVERYTHING for themselves, that person is still a kid. And kids are rebellious and irrational, and often think they know everything while hating on those who dare burst their bubble. \u201cBut if OP raised him right he wouldn\u2019t be this way!\u201d Technically true, but who can say for sure they WILL be a great parent when they have their first child? And frankly, how the kid develope is also dependent on the social setting, not only solely by their parents\u2019 guidance. Kids often will hide their interactions in school and such from their parents, whether to appear \u2018cool\u2019 or they feel ashamed and don\u2019t have the mental capacity to come out and talk heart to heart.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: school shooter\u2019s parents don\u2019t intend to raise school shooters in most cases, the kid probably thought a dad who doesn\u2019t constrict him while doing cool shit with him is better than the one who CARES about him.</p>\n\n<p>Also NTA</p>\n</div>",

On this post especially, I think it\u2019s reckless to hand down a verdict other than INFO.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  To be clear, I think that my example #1 is the least likely option because it\u2019s very rare to find someone this crappy.  They do exist though, so it\u2019s still a possibility.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Yeah, I empathize with OP and believe this experience is genuinely painful for him, but as someone who grew up in a similar scenario, I got some weird vibes off his post. Mostly OP's focus on his own perspective without ever mentioning, or even wondering about, his son's experience in all this. Makes me suspect this trend is reflected in real life. \n\nWhen a person does not stop to wonder what is driving their loved one's concerning behavior, it is a massive red flag to me. It is a sign that the person doesn't care about their loved one's actual being, and would prefer to focus on how their loved one's well being affects THEM. Interestingly, a major point of contention between my mom and I was how close I was with my father. She always felt as though it was \"unfair\" and the entire topic enraged her. She has never once asked me why I trusted my dad more than her. She just blamed me for doing so. \n\nHope you see this OP. I have no doubt that you love your son and are genuinely hurt by this outcome. If you want to repair your relationship with him, I think you need to ASK him what is going on. If you are not open to introspection and making some changes in accordance with what he has to say to you, if you think this is his \"fault\" and he should be the one to fix it--well, that is exactly why he is more interested in having a relationship with his bio dad than with you.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, I empathize with OP and believe this experience is genuinely painful for him, but as someone who grew up in a similar scenario, I got some weird vibes off his post. Mostly OP&#39;s focus on his own perspective without ever mentioning, or even wondering about, his son&#39;s experience in all this. Makes me suspect this trend is reflected in real life. </p>\n\n<p>When a person does not stop to wonder what is driving their loved one&#39;s concerning behavior, it is a massive red flag to me. It is a sign that the person doesn&#39;t care about their loved one&#39;s actual being, and would prefer to focus on how their loved one&#39;s well being affects THEM. Interestingly, a major point of contention between my mom and I was how close I was with my father. She always felt as though it was &quot;unfair&quot; and the entire topic enraged her. She has never once asked me why I trusted my dad more than her. She just blamed me for doing so. </p>\n\n<p>Hope you see this OP. I have no doubt that you love your son and are genuinely hurt by this outcome. If you want to repair your relationship with him, I think you need to ASK him what is going on. If you are not open to introspection and making some changes in accordance with what he has to say to you, if you think this is his &quot;fault&quot; and he should be the one to fix it--well, that is exactly why he is more interested in having a relationship with his bio dad than with you.</p>\n</div>",

No, of course not, because he would still be *your dad.* He raised you, he supported you, he's the one you turned to when you needed help, advice, or love.\n\n\nOP's point is that, if the son can dismiss him so easily even after 22 years of father-son bonding, there likely wasn't much of a relationship there to begin with. Normal people don't just ditch a relationship where there's love and trust, just because the DNA suddenly doesn't match up.\n\nEdit: I wasn't trying to say OP is bad, or did something wrong. I apologize, since it was worded badly. I'm saying I feel like there's missing info here, because relationships don't typically go from \"great\" to \"I'm taking my bio dad's name, peace out.\" Either son is a total jerk, or has deep resentment that OP is unaware of, or it's way more complicated than all of that; we don't know, because OP doesn't know. I just think there's more to the story than \"We found out his bio dad exists, two years yadda yadda, and now he wants to take the other guy's name.

Some people self reflect and try to do better and others just become adults who are assholes. So there could be a lot missing here, or just as if not more likely, the kid could just be acting like a selfish asshole and not realize how his actions are affecting his father emotionally.</p>\n</div>",

Right now his father has no real power over him anymore because Ops son can say \"You're not my real dad\".  His son might be feeling sort of \"free\" in knowing he has power over both his parents and now including a new one.\n\n* Ops son might actually feel guilty about his dad raising him unknowingly as his own son.  He might be feeling that it's his fault his parents are divorced.  That his dad might not love him the way he did anymore now that his dad knows the truth, but trying to simply \"play the part\" of his dad so HE can still have control.\n\n* Lastly ops son just might feel sorry for his bio dad who may have never known he existed.  He might feel as though he owes his biological dad a connection that he was robbed of.  That his biological dad was actually more innocent in this manner than the man who raised him.\n\nThe problem OPs son is going to have moving forward is that all those emotions and thoughts are making him miss the most important part of all this.  For 22 years he was being raised by a man who treated him like a son and still believes he was his son.  That the man he called father for 22 years, good and bad times, was their for him and wants to be going forward.\n\nI feel sorry for OP, but I understand what might be going on in his sons head.

That his dad might not love him the way he did anymore now that his dad knows the truth, but trying to simply &quot;play the part&quot; of his dad so HE can still have control.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lastly ops son just might feel sorry for his bio dad who may have never known he existed.  He might feel as though he owes his biological dad a connection that he was robbed of.  That his biological dad was actually more innocent in this manner than the man who raised him.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem OPs son is going to have moving forward is that all those emotions and thoughts are making him miss the most important part of all this.  For 22 years he was being raised by a man who treated him like a son and still believes he was his son.  That the man he called father for 22 years, good and bad times, was their for him and wants to be going forward.</p>\n\n<p>I feel sorry for OP, but I understand what might be going on in his sons head.  Just hope ops son figures this out sooner rather than later or he will regret this decision and it will hit him like a ton of bricks when he has his own children.</p>\n</div>",
