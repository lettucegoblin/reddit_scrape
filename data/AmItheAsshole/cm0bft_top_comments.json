In fact, I am under the impression that he would probably have died with the machine still holding the money had this not happened. And considering that he didn't stop people from leaving with 50 bucks, him clinging to all the money also didn't seem to be the intent.

Are you honestly saying \u201cOP is TA for not allowing a stranger to take $500 of her grandmother\u2019s money, $100 of her money, and $100 of her friends money, because they put a couple quarters in a novelty machine without even asking if it was ok even though a normal person might assume the actual friends of OP had permission and they should get permission too, and the complete stranger friend of a friend is NTA for scooping money off the ground like they are fucking golem, thinking they fucking hit it big even though they are at a party at a friend of a friends house not a casino, and then **threatening to sue them for the money and call the cops**\u201d\n\nSeriously. In what WORLD can going to a friend of a friends house for a party and then threatening to sue them and call the cops on them in their own house be considered NTA behavior. What are people smoking here?\n\nI obviously think OP is NTA. Say ESH if you want, but anyone voting YTA is, themselves, TA. \n\nAnd anybody who doesn\u2019t see the difference between giving a friend $50 and giving a stranger $700 obviously does not socialize very often. I liked the analogy another commenter gave of the difference between finding a $5 in the couch and being told \u2018you know what? Finders keepers, it\u2019s yours\u2019 and finding a $100 in the couch and threatening to sue when asked to give it back.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It floors me, absolutely blows my mind the YTA votes here. Do you people even know what YTA means? Are you honestly saying \u201cOP is TA for not allowing a stranger to take $500 of her grandmother\u2019s money, $100 of her money, and $100 of her friends money, because they put a couple quarters in a novelty machine without even asking if it was ok even though a normal person might assume the actual friends of OP had permission and they should get permission too, and the complete stranger friend of a friend is NTA for scooping money off the ground like they are fucking golem, thinking they fucking hit it big even though they are at a party at a friend of a friends house not a casino, and then <strong>threatening to sue them for the money and call the cops</strong>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Seriously. In what WORLD can going to a friend of a friends house for a party and then threatening to sue them and call the cops on them in their own house be considered NTA behavior. What are people smoking here?</p>\n\n<p>I obviously think OP is NTA. Say ESH if you want, but anyone voting YTA is, themselves, TA. </p>\n\n<p>And anybody who doesn\u2019t see the difference between giving a friend $50 and giving a stranger $700 obviously does not socialize very often. I liked the analogy another commenter gave of the difference between finding a $5 in the couch and being told \u2018you know what? Finders keepers, it\u2019s yours\u2019 and finding a $100 in the couch and threatening to sue when asked to give it back. Precedence means nothing compared to context, and the context here is the difference between friend and stranger and the difference between small sums of money and $700.</p>\n</div>",

But, no, based on the story, you&#39;re NTA because it&#39;s your house, not a casino. </p>\n\n<p>Okay, let&#39;s look at it another way. Say guest came over and played a round of Wheel of Fortune on a novelty video game that you have from the 80s, and the guest beat out two other NPCs to make it to the final round, and won a red convertible by correctly identifying the word in the final round. NPC Vanna White stands in front of a video game shiney red car. You think you actually have to provide the car for the guest??? What if the game took quarters, like an old school arcade? Like a fucking pin ball? What then?? No. You don&#39;t owe them a red convertible, that&#39;s nonsense. But still, you should probably grow up a bit, cause your attitude is shitty.</p>\n</div>",
