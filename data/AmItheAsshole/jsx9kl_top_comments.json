Imagine the worst case scenario: Shanaya gives the password to a relative that uses it to plan a terrorist attack or buy drugs on the darkweb or download illegal pornography. That network traffic comes from your home, the FBI / DHS / DEA / ATF etc. busts down your door, shoots your dog or worse, takes all your computers and you end up in an insane legal battle to try to prove your innocence.\n\nSo at a minimum this has to stop. If you want to continue giving just Shanaya access then there's better ways to accomplish that:\n\nLow tech solution: Change the password; enter it for Shanaya as needed but don't actually tell her what it is.\n\nPros: Easy. Cons: Not that hard to figure out what the password is, and does nothing to stop Shanaya from using it for non-school activities.\n\nMedium tech solution: Change the password. Then create a list of the MAC addresses of any whitelisted devices on your router and block access to all but the whitelisted devices. Add all of your household's devices and Shanaya's computer.\n\nPros: Better network security overall. Cons: A bit tedious to identify every device in your home that needs WiFi access (every phone, printer, smart device, computer, TV, etc). Also doesn't stop Shanaya from using your network on her device after school hours.\n\nHighest tech solution: Change the password. Then make a totally new guest network. Figure out a way to create a whitelist that only lets Shanaya's computer on the guest network and has a separate password and lets you set time limits for access. Block all domains that aren't whitelisted (those needed for her schoolwork). These features may or may not be available on your specific router so you might need a new router. There might be ways to add this functionality to a router that doesn't have that baked in but that's beyond me.\n\nPros: Shanaya doesn't get access to your other devices, as they won't be on the guest network. Shanaya can share the password, but it only works for her computer even if she does. She can only go to websites that you approve. Finally you can set it to work only during school hours. Cons: Complex to setup, might need new networking equipment, could be difficult to manage the network moving forward if you don't know what you are doing.",

I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.\n\nI asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.\n\nMy daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected.
