Let\u2019s assume  22.5k total cost for semester and he has 15 credits then each credit cost 1500.   If he has a 3 credit class that costs 4500.   If he got an a. I pay 100%.  If he got an a-  I pay 98% he pays 2%. A B+. Is a 90/10 split etc.   each class is calculated to determine final split of cost.   My son is similar to me when I was his age and needed am incentive to study and so does he.   He has a 3.4 gpa with this deal.   Don\u2019t worry he still enjoys school and joins clubs etc.   He does have summer internships which pay him well but he doesn\u2019t have to work during school.  I didn\u2019t do this while he attended a community college for his AS and his GPA wasn\u2019t as good.</p>\n</div>",

My dad rolled in the next day screaming at them AND THEY CHANGED THE CLASSES. The next day, I stopped by because blackboard was giving me information that I was not expecting. They told me what happened and I asked to be reenrolled in my original classes. Apparently some of them had since filled up and they couldn't do it. I was really upset and they explained that my dad was just so scary. And I get it, he was. But I asked why they hadn't called the police (I'd been trying to get help about my dad but no one was taking me seriously) and they just could not answer. I was like 'so you let a man who REALLY SCARED you come in here and threaten all of you and you were SO SCARED that you did what he wanted which was BREAK THE LAW (FERPA is a thing THANK GOD) and you couldn't even call the police afterward? And now you're mad at me for another adult's actions? Did he even prove he was related to me? How did he show actual proof he was given permission from ME that he could do that? Can I change someone else's classes?' \n\nIt ended up with me re-enrolled and him banned from campus, but it was bewildering for my dad and the first time I REALLY saw the professional consequences for his continued interference.

He was very insistent on wanting to send me congratulatory flowers as a way to get my work contact info, so we gave him the contact info a friend at a tech company in that city. So now those in the know get the fun of hearing all about how he orchestrated me having this job at a place I&#39;ve never worked at in a city I&#39;ve never lived in. It&#39;s pretty hilarious.</p>\n</div>",
