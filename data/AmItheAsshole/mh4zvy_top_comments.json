Because she\u2019s been in the bedroom for hours now, watching youtube, refusing to talk to me about what\u2019s happened. A few minutes ago, one of the cats started meowing and scratching to get into the room. Within seconds of him doing that, she ran over to the door and kicked it really hard and screamed \u201cThis is all your fault. Fuck off.\u201d\n\nIt scared the shit out of the cat and he hid under the couch. I opened the door and asked her what her deal was, that it could have hurt the cat, and she said \u201cGood. Fuck the cat.\u201d\n\nSo I told her to get out of the house and go find somewhere to stay for a while. She tried to cry her way out of the situation, but I told her I had enough. I\u2019m done. She had every opportunity to talk to me, and now she\u2019s screaming at the cats and kicking doors and scaring them. I tried to listen and offered help, but she wanted none of it. Too late.\n\nAs she was leaving I told her she can call me when she\u2019s calmed down and willing to talk. I\u2019m just so drained at this point. I tried.\n\nI gave her a chance to talk before all of this, and she insisted there was nothing to talk about. I may not have handled it the most mature/healthy way, sure, but I tried. Maybe this can be fixed, maybe not. I had hope a few hours ago, now I just...whatever.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry.\n\nI think I\u2019m done replying for now. Just so much going on. So much to think about. Too many trollish comments and messages, too many people coming up with conspiracy theories, too many people who can\u2019t read or bother to check my comments.

I know you said that she slept all night, but what looks like sleep may not be it.\n\nFor the longest time I thought it was my cats that were waking me up at night. However, once the last of them had passed over the rainbow bridge and I was still having this issue I knew it was something different. I *thought* I was sleeping all night, however, I actually wasn't. I tried all sorts of sleep tests, etc. I figured out what was my issue (my mattress was so old and with the arthritis I've developed I kept waking up from the pain without realizing I was waking up.)\n\nNext time ask your wife if you can observe her *sleeping*. See if she has sleep apnea, or some other sleeping problem that could possibly be disturbing her sleep. Sometimes small almost imperceptible gasps could be her breathing has stopped during her sleep and that can disturb the sleep cycle. See about getting a sleep study done to rule out any problems or issues. Yeah, I know she says she physically gets up to let the cats our or something, but that may be some sort of sleep/dream/barely awake state. I've had moments where I felt like someone was staring at me. It felt very real but obviously wasn't.\n\nAlso, this whole \"sneaking around\" to prove one's wife is lying seems to be really prevalent. I don't understand why spouses just can't be honest and say, \"Fine. I'll stay up to see what's going on\" rather than sneaking around like this. It feels like a lie and I've seen this before many times on this sub. Still think NTA, but actions like this just reek of dishonesty. That's why your wife is responding the way she is, because this really feels really dishonest and like you've tricked her. Instead of talking through what the problem might be you tricked her. She's lost some trust in you. Hell, I would too. My husband and I don't do things like this. We believe each other and then investigate to see what's really going on.",

She\u2019s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she\u2019s frustrated every night that she \u201chas to get up and open the door for the cats\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep making noises\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep jumping on her.\u201d It got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. I told her I\u2019ve never seem or heard any of this, but she claims I sleep through it all.\n\nShe kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something.\n\nOne morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren\u2019t adding up, so I decided to run a test.\n\nI waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened.\n\nSure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it.\n\nI told her, \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?\u201d She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole.\n\nI did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up.\n\nSo, am I an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My 20 year old cat did constantly wake me, to do things for her (like touch the food in her food bowl, or turn on the faucet to drink running water, at 2am) and in order to kinda like shift responsibility to a non person worked out very well. \nI think that the cats need to be out of the room while you sleep and all cats needs should be met, even their princess need for fresh running water. </p>\n\n<p>I think after you consider these things then you can consider why she might be \u201clying\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t assume right away she was. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on from a dead sleep at 4am I think it\u2019s unreasonable for her to.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Well done for protecting your cats and your boundaries. It sounds like there may be some kind of trauma response happening here for your wife, especially since you mention her challenges with forming friendships and past abuse. It may sound strange, but perhaps she is jealous of the care you have for the cats and perceives you as caring more for them that for her? \n\nI have had some conflicts with my husband about our two cats and two dogs. he is extremely protective of the cats and resentful of the dogs. more specifically of their neediness and energy vs the cats relaxed, aloof nature that suits him. He has a physical reaction to the dogs when they bark like nails on a chalkboard and hates when they make a fuss of him for attention, and ESPECIALLY hates me letting them on our bed, whereas I have a hard time with his snapping at them and want to soothe them, and I love encouraging their affectionate natures (particularly the mother as she was deserted while pregnant with our other dog).\n\nI grew up with all kinds of pets and he didn't. We initially got the cats \"for me\" to help with my mental health, and when we were at a shelter, one of them \\*chose\\* him, and she had a brother. My husband only wanted one cat, but \"couldn't separate blood\" so left it to me to decide, and we got both. (In hindsight I am so glad we did, I had no real feelings for him at first and he was a very challenging kitten who seemed to struggle with having been separated from their mother while she was referred to as a \"turn key cat\" and as an adult he is the sweetest, gentlest giant fluff of a cat I've ever met and even helped raised my dog's puppies). My husband \\*hated\\* the kitten phase when they were needy and unruly, but after they matured around a year (we got them at 5 months old), they have increasingly become the actual lights of his life. His favourite thing in the world is getting their food because he loves the feeling of taking care of them. \n\nHe has been slower to adjust to the dogs, and went from not really caring about animals,  to being a self-described cat guy. But I catch him having sweet moments with the dogs, and would even help me out with my side gig as a dog walker/sitter and was great with them. He just isn't used to animals, I only recently found out he has a fish once, but otherwise never any animals. His mom likes cats, but his dad seems to have a hatred or phobia of pets (I suspect he has OCD in particular about cleanliness) and actively avoids all animals, and has passed some of this onto my husband. Don't even get me started on what happened when we moved cross country by u haul and stopped in to stay with them.\n\nSo it's a work in progress for us. It can be really hard. the dogs changed my whole life for the better, before them I unexpectedly ended up with a hospice dog that shifted my entire focus in life; then when she passed away, I fostered our pregnant dog to do some good in hospice dog's name and help with my grief. and I fell totally in love like I swore I wouldn't.\n\nWhat helps me a lot is attending CoDependents Anonymous meetings. The name may sound scary, but it really is about helping with dysfunctional relationships and working toward healthy boundaries and fulfilling relationships. If you ever want to come to a meeting, I would be happy to share the info for my meeting with you.\n\nIt sounds like you've taken some really healthy steps and I commend you for it. I can see why staying up all night to prove your suspicions may feel extreme and unfair and why she would get upset. But I also understand how crazy-making feeling gaslit can be. I agree that this may be part of some kind of mental illness for her that she may or may not be doing deliberately, but either way, it sounds like she needs some help. Like you said, that's up to her, and all you can control is you own behavior and I commend your courage and wisdom to know what you can do and make what I imagine was a tough call.",

When she talks about you lying about going to sleep so you can spy on her, reframe that as \"I didn't mean to upset you, I just wanted to get an idea of the cat's behaviour myself so that I could address it. If they're jumping on you in the night and howling maybe I could do something to address that if I could figure out why they were being so noisy, you know? I kept notes just because I didn't want to fall asleep and not remember, especially if they were being noisy lots of times I didn't want to try and remember that all in my head, and again the better I understand when they're being noisy and why, the more I can do to address it and help you.\"\n\nRemain super super calm, don't engage with her if she's throwing out accusations or ultimatums, you can keep going back to \"I can see you're really upset by all this, and I want to make things better for you, so to do that I'm trying to find out what the problem is. Can you help me understand what's going on?\". Try and be as collaborative as possible, even if she's not cooperating. Maybe you could try \"okay maybe last night was a one off where the cats were behaving (IGNORING the fact she lied), I really want to understand why they're behaving badly, what do you think is the best way I could monitor them? Maybe we could both stay up together if you want, and watch some movies or something? I know you don't want me filming you, maybe I could record audio in the hallway/living room where they're hanging out? \". Keep trying to move the conversation to her providing solutions, rather than ultimatums. \n\nIt might be she sticks to her ultimatum and says \"no I don't care about you monitoring them, you should be able to take my word for it and you should just pick me over the cats, if I say you should get rid of them that should be enough!\". I would probably come back gently with \"and I absolutely will if it comes to it. I know you love these cats and it must be really upsetting you a lot if you want to get rid of them, but if something in their behaviour has changed suddenly it might mean that they're ill. I'm sure you just want to go back to having a good night's sleep, so if we can work out what's going on with the cats then there might be a really easy fix. Image if we gave them away and it just turned out they had a stomach bug or something, wouldn't that be sad? \"\n\nNow obviously, there IS nothing wrong with the cats, but I think it's in your benefit not to put her into a corner here. The less she feels attacked (even if you're not attacking her) the more likely she's going to a. open up with what the real problem is, or b. be willing to explore options for resolving this situation. It might not be solved in one conversation, it might be a case of slowly, with her on board, trying to \"monitor the cats\", then moving on to gently try and explore other options like speaking to a doctor, couple's counselling etc etc. I probably wouldn't jump straight in on your first conversation with counselling and seeing the doctor, you can always circle back to that in a few days /weeks if you feel you need to.\n\nIf you're getting stuck in a loop I would also maybe gently ask \"hey, were you serious the other day when you said you would leave me? I know you're sleep is obviously a big issue, and I'll do whatever I can to help with the cats when we've figured out what's wrong with them, but is there something else going on here? It just feels like, maybe you wouldn't leave over the cats if everything else was good between us, is there something I'm missing here? I just really want to make things better for you, whatever it is \"\n\nJust my two cents anyway, obviously you know your wife better than I do! All the best OP",

It might not be solved in one conversation, it might be a case of slowly, with her on board, trying to &quot;monitor the cats&quot;, then moving on to gently try and explore other options like speaking to a doctor, couple&#39;s counselling etc etc. I probably wouldn&#39;t jump straight in on your first conversation with counselling and seeing the doctor, you can always circle back to that in a few days /weeks if you feel you need to.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re getting stuck in a loop I would also maybe gently ask &quot;hey, were you serious the other day when you said you would leave me? I know you&#39;re sleep is obviously a big issue, and I&#39;ll do whatever I can to help with the cats when we&#39;ve figured out what&#39;s wrong with them, but is there something else going on here? It just feels like, maybe you wouldn&#39;t leave over the cats if everything else was good between us, is there something I&#39;m missing here? I just really want to make things better for you, whatever it is &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Just my two cents anyway, obviously you know your wife better than I do! All the best OP</p>\n</div>",

Manipulation abuse is the worst because after a while you start questioning your own sanity and ability to make decisions. You get to the point where you start questioning their motive everytime they say or do ANYTHING (because, let's be real, there's ALWAYS a notice behind everything a manipulate abuser does.) Then you start thinking your a paranoid asshole because what decent person would do that? It's the easiest to gaslight because, on paper, it doesn't look like the abuser did anything wrong. They just told some white lies here and there, maybe just exaggerated a bit.  A lot of people use manipulation abuse as a type of psychological torture too. They run a little slow and \"accidentally\" make you late to every appointment. They find little sounds or idiosyncrasies that annoy and suddenly it's something they repeat all the time. Any time you have a great accomplishment then something is going to come up with them and you're going to need to redirect all attention onto them. Any time you set a concrete boundary they figure out a way to get you to let in just a little so that they can then convince you that you contradicted yourself and therefore that boundary doesn't exist. It gets to the point where you're always on edge and your energy is always drained and you have no idea why you're always so exhausted and upset. After all, they were just late a couple of times, just made some annoying noises here and there, just told a little white lie or two. But that's not what they're really doing. What they're really doing is manipulating every situation to be in their favor. They're finding every psychological button you have and pushing it as often as possible.

Her husband claiming to have stayed up all night to watch her is much less concrete and easily dismissible as him just lying.

Not a wink of sleep!\" And it turns out she slept for like six hours and genuinely truly believed that she didn't get any sleep at all that night. She was so mad at Dr. Winter for \"lying\" to her even when presented with evidence that she never returned to his clinic.\n\nThe brain plays tricks on people all the time, especially when it comes to dreams, memories, and lack of sleep.

All of us have narcissistic moments and traits, but for most it's minimal and we have enough self awareness and empathy to usually catch ourselves behaving that way and stop and/or apologize.\n\nSomeone farther down the spectrum, someone we would consider a narcissist, worse, a toxic narcissist.  Sometimes it's a reflexive response to hide and protect the fragile ego they try so hard to keep covered up.  A defense mechanism stemming from deeper issues.  Sometimes it's calculated and thought out and they know exactly what they're doing.  I've had the good fortune of having dated 2 of them >_>.\n\nOne was just kind of the run of the mill angry, over-sensitive toxic narcissist.  He mostly just reflexively reacted with anger and negging and gaslighting.  The other was a full blown sociopathic narcissist.  Sounds like a dramatic label, I know, but I'm not exaggerating.  It's a long story but suffice it to say he's a self serving monster with zero sense of empathy or remorse.  After 5 years I found out everything I knew about him was a lie, he was that good.  He knew exactly what he was doing, how to play everyone around him, how to manipulate and isolate me.  He was very calm and calculated and planned all of his elaborate lies.  Even after I blew the lid off of his sham publicly (a sham that hurt and used multiple people, not just me) and people believed it (he literally left town once the truth came out, it was pretty obvious he was guilty)...some people still forgave him and accepted him back as a friend.  He was THAT good.\n\nAnyway, just trying to kind of explain where I'm coming from, that I know what you're going through.  Because I went through those same mental battles.  I have been where you are and you sound a lot like me.  A little insecure, highly tuned to how you make the people around you feel, quick to apologize and feel bad if you've rocked the boat, wanting to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Empathy, compassion, and wanting to see the good in people are admirable and good traits...but sadly they make us easy targets for people like that.\n\nI don't know you or your SO or your relationship, but the best advice I can give you is trust your gut and look out for yourself.  It sounds like you already know what's going on, how you're being treated, that it's wrong.  Don't spend anymore time letting your mental health dwindle away at the hands of someone who doesn't care about it.  If your instincts are telling you something is wrong, *listen*.  Being highly empathetic is a double edged sword.  We've got good instincts about people and can pick up their vibes more easily...but we're so sensitive to how they feel and worry about how we might make them feel that we suppress those instincts for their sake, whether they deserve it or not.\n\nSpeak to a therapist to help you get some third party objective insight.  I'm not trying to tell you you're def with a narcissist that's hurting you, I'm not trying to be that Reddit cliche of crying out red flag and insisting you leave.  I don't know nearly enough about you to make any of those judgement calls.  You do though, you do know.  So again, the best advice I can give is trust your own gut and don't be afraid to put your wellbeing first if you're being mistreated.\n\nFeel free to DM if you need a little moral support.  If that's really the situation you're in and you decide you want to act on it, I know how hard it is to muster up the nerve to call them out and then walk away.  I know I couldn't have done it alone.  It took a good friend finally catching me letting my guard down and talking about how bad it was and seeing through the whole facade and supporting me and backing me up when I finally made my move and got out.\n\nStay safe, happy, and healthy :).",

There was often blowback if you have anxiety because it means something different--can't work due to anxiety (my dad's case)? Nope, it's because you're lazy. Depressed? Shake it off, don't take meds; if you do, you're weak. \n\nMy dad suffers from anxiety in many ways, and hasn't really been able to work for years because of it--it became debilitating to the point where he'd suddenly faint and have amnesia for a few hours (saw it happen, and it scared the crap out of me). Other times, it would be like he had symptoms of stroke or TIA, but everything would be fine. One day, I visited my mom's parents (may they rest in peace), and Grandpa went off on how Dad had lost another job working overnight because he just didn't want to work and that he is lazy (he's not--Dad always had been the hardest working guys I've ever known; turns out, working overnights didn't agree with him and it triggered even more severe anxiety). It's people like my grandfather that make it hard to even discuss meds in many cases, and it's still hard to get rid of that stigma. \n\nI remember even when I was growing up that having \"mental illness\" meant that the person was crazy and they should be institutionalized. If they weren't hearing voices, had multiple personality disorder, or huge things like that, then they just need to suck it up, deal, and get over whatever was bothering them. \n\nIt could be that OP's wife had heard something similar while growing up and to this day has a difficult time discussing it, hence, her reaction. TBH, I'd likely react in a similar fashion if not getting enough restful sleep (anyone who has ever lived with a newborn should know this feeling).",

        "body": "TLDR, it's kind of hard to answer your question but I also initially felt ready to just walk off into the sunset with my dog and never be in a relationship again.  But I wound up with someone I trust entirely pretty much the moment I got out of the abusive situation.  Though I would say rushing into a relationship after a toxic one is probably ill advised, lol.  I think I just kind of really lucked out and good things just fell into place without my intending to move forward that way.  Maybe it just comes down to finding the right person that helps you feel secure again.  And therapy doesn't hurt either :p.\n\nIt's the absolute worst.  I think it was my time with the first one that kind of primed me for the second.  I was with the first one for about a year with a couple of break ups/make ups during that time.  He was the textbook love bomber.  Huge gestures that had you convinced he loved you and showed it enough to forgive the awful shit.  Took a good couple months to shake him after I finally ended it.  Kept contacting me with apologies and kind words and when that didn't work got nasty and insulting to try to play on my insecurity (to be taken advantage of), then threats, then silence for a few days then back to apologize and starting the cycle over.  It all messed with my head enough that when the second came along I constantly second guessed myself.\n\nAny time I felt something was off about him, something was wrong, I thought maybe it's just in my head.  Maybe I'm just projecting my issues from the last guy.  Ignored my instincts over and over telling myself I had to be able to trust, couldn't let my past cloud my judgement, etc.  Even had a therapist ask me what my instincts were telling me, I think she was suspicious, but I just kept squashing those doubts down.  That's why I stressed so much in the comment above about listening to your gut.  I ignored mine and I suffered for it.\n\n>Can I ask how long it took you to trust people again? I feel like my brain is permanently fucked from the experience.\n\nI feel like mine's permanently fucked too.  I have some major hang ups with sex now.  He often pressured and pushed and guilted and manipulated me into it when I didn't want to.  As time went on I never wanted to, but I did just to appease him so he'd leave me alone for a while.  It's tough to wrap my head around it, he didn't physically force me...but he also didn't give a fuck when I just laid there still and stiff as bored, often with tears involved.  And now sex doesn't feel like an intimate wag to connect with someone you care about, it's like I've lost the sense of connecting it with love and closeness.  I think that for me is my biggest issue now, some CPTSD issues, emotional flashback type stuff that flares up occasionally, but the sex issue is the most constant and prevent for me.\n\nTbh I think I mostly trust people still.  I'm with a great guy and we have a beautiful 3.5yo daughter together.  I've been out of the abusive situation for about 4.5 years.  So yeeaahhh, I got together with someone reeaallyy fast after getting out.  Which I probably should not have, told myself I wasn't going to.  But tbh he's the friend who got me out of it.  I was in a really bad, really dark place when he reached out to me (just as a friend, we hadn't talked in ages).  It doesn't feel like an overstatement to say he saved my life.  He did some digging and found social media I had been blocked from that I never knew existed and that's what lead to uncovering the lies.  I called the douche narc to tell him I knew everything and kick him out because I was afraid to do it in person.  My friend was with me when I made that call and let me crash there while the douche cleared out of my home.\n\nAnyway, we'd known each other for about 12 years at that point, my sister was (and still is) married to a close friend of his.  So we had a connection and knew each other and I think that helped the trust come more easily for me.  And he was there for the messy end of it all so knowing he already knew what I'd been through and that I was kind of fucked up from it helped.  I didn't have to worry about trying to explain it and whatnot.  I was riding this initial high of feeling like I'd beat the fucker and broke free...and well one thing lead to another and we became more than friends pretty damn fast, lol.  And then against some crazy odds (hormone disorder that often causes infertility) our daughter happened by surprise which kind of fast tracked our relationship, lol.  And thankfully it just got stronger and we found ourselves happily ready to commit for the long haul.  We've got our struggles and they largely stem from my issues following all of that, but trust and faith in each other hasn't been an issue.\n\nI don't think that's the norm for most in abusive situations like that though, I think I kind of just lucked out.  So tbh I wouldn't actually change my past at all.  Awful as it was and as hard as the resulting issues are, I wouldn't have ended up with him and I wouldn't have my daughter.  And I wouldn't give that up for anything in the world.\n\nLord I'm rambly and typing a lot today, I'm sorry for the walls of text, lol.  Adderall (by prescription, lol) and caffeine kicked in while reading and typing here and my brain kind of went hyper focus mode on it, lmao.  Now I've gotta try to redirect that focus to some housework XD.",
