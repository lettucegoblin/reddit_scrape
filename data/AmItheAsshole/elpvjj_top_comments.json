The 1st year is so unbelievably brutal with twins, even if you have a supportive spouse you feel like you're drowning. My husband and I were together 13 years before our twins, best friends, high school sweethearts, never fought, and we contemplated divorce many times that 1st year. They're 16 months and we still get into it sometimes, but it's gotten closer to normal.\n\nIt is SO hard. You need to sit down and figure out how to divvy up responsibilities and figure out your expectations from each other. With one baby one partner can do baby stuff and the other can do house stuff if they just aren't confident or happy being a primary caregiver, when you have 2 that's out the window. Figure it out now, eventually you'll either be a sahm or back to work and him not helping is going to be even more stressful. If you can't talk it out get into family therapy asap.",

        "body": "Wow, I didn\u2019t realize this was such a common thing. My ex did this too. Not the cheating, but locking himself in the bathroom for hours watching porn (and also doing a lot of cocaine). Sometimes, he\u2019d try to get me involved by dragging me into our bedroom and locking the door. He didn\u2019t care if our child was hungry, crying, or needed anything (even worse, he\u2019d complain that the noise of the child was irritating to him as if that\u2019s all that mattered), he would just lock the door, pull his dick out, and turn on some porn and I was expected to be grateful for his attention. If I refused, he\u2019d get upset and go lock himself in the bathroom alone. When I got mad about the way he acted, he\u2019d gaslight me and make me feel like I\u2019m crazy for not understanding his needs. I was the bad guy for not giving him enough attention because my child needed me. He\u2019d always guilt trip me for not putting his needs above everyone else\u2019s. It was seriously crazy and I don\u2019t know why I put up with it for so long. He never cared about our child one bit and he has another child from before we met of whom he also lost custody when he was a baby.\n\nThese types of people only care about themselves. I guess that\u2019s why these guys are exes or soon to be exes. I left my ex just a few months ago after 12 years of abuse and my kid knows all the horrible stuff he did and still thinks he\u2019s great. I only hope one day they\u2019ll see him for what he really is. Nothing I can say will make that happen but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll reveal himself in time or my kid will understand it more when they\u2019re older. Some people are just not meant to be parents.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow, I didn\u2019t realize this was such a common thing. My ex did this too. Not the cheating, but locking himself in the bathroom for hours watching porn (and also doing a lot of cocaine). Sometimes, he\u2019d try to get me involved by dragging me into our bedroom and locking the door. He didn\u2019t care if our child was hungry, crying, or needed anything (even worse, he\u2019d complain that the noise of the child was irritating to him as if that\u2019s all that mattered), he would just lock the door, pull his dick out, and turn on some porn and I was expected to be grateful for his attention. If I refused, he\u2019d get upset and go lock himself in the bathroom alone. When I got mad about the way he acted, he\u2019d gaslight me and make me feel like I\u2019m crazy for not understanding his needs. I was the bad guy for not giving him enough attention because my child needed me. He\u2019d always guilt trip me for not putting his needs above everyone else\u2019s. It was seriously crazy and I don\u2019t know why I put up with it for so long. He never cared about our child one bit and he has another child from before we met of whom he also lost custody when he was a baby.</p>\n\n<p>These types of people only care about themselves. I guess that\u2019s why these guys are exes or soon to be exes. I left my ex just a few months ago after 12 years of abuse and my kid knows all the horrible stuff he did and still thinks he\u2019s great. I only hope one day they\u2019ll see him for what he really is. Nothing I can say will make that happen but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll reveal himself in time or my kid will understand it more when they\u2019re older.

During that time he was the sole breadwinner and we were childless (except the dog and 2 cats), so I earned my keep by doing all the housework. But then when I started working again, the balance never shifted. We had a fair few fights about it. Fast forward a few years and he will clean and help out, but usually I have to specifically tell him what to do even when it seems obvious. \n\nHonestly, it is easier for me to just do it myself. I have him take our 2 year old to play out of the way (I have 3 part time jobs, 2 of which include working with children and I still stay home with my son on weekends and one or two days a week) so that I get a break from toddler duty and can listen to my podcasts while he cleans.\n\nWe currently live in a huge remodeled Amish house (3000 square feet if you include the basement) with 2 dogs, 2 cats, and our son.

If you want some down time you have to squeeze that in there too, and the colic nights plus the times they just don't want to sleep when you do.  You can't leave them to play and take a nap if you are on your own. I mean, you could but clearly shouldn't.  All kids are different, but ours did 6hour nights around 6months.

It made a huge difference to my wife's sanity, postpartum, and the quality of our relationship.  \nI worked 12 hour continental shifts while my wife stayed home with each of our kids.  She would end up sleep deprived so I would do my best to get up during the night at least once and give her time to herself.  Lots of husband's don't though.  The ones who babysit their own kids I guess.\nSome kids get colic or other things too.  It all just builds up over time until you feel worn to the bone.
