This went on for the whole 20 years they were married now my mom always feels like our home is never clean enough and gets major anxiety about people coming over because she fears that people will judge our home like my grandparents once did. I&#39;m here to say it doesn&#39;t get better until you properly stand up for yourself and leave i&#39;m sorry but they will never accept you and they will continue talking you down and icing you out.

My mother was a young med school graduate and highly educated while my grandmother got married after only completing the 12th grade. \n\nIt wasn't even 3 days after the wedding that my grandmother's true side started to appear and from then on all hell broke loose. My mother had my brother and me almost back to back and was forced to leave her job because no one would take care of us and maids almost always sexually abuse children. Something my mother didn't want us to go through. \n\nShe woke up early in the morning, and before eating anything for herself, she made lunch for my aunts and prepared breakfast for my grandparents and uncles, and their spouses. And yet, every single time they nitpicked something, \"We didn't want eggs today.\" \"I asked for tea.\" \"This food is undercooked.\" She was also in charge of cleaning the house, despite there being maids. \n\nMy mother put up with all of this because she thought they would recognize and appreciate her if she worked hard enough. And let her, my brother, and I become part of the family. In doing this she sacrificed her mental health and suffered from depression for 8 long years. And this affected my brother and I as well, since she sometimes got so fed up she would beat my brother. \n\nI have memories of being woken up in the night with my hair pulled by her, not knowing what was going on or why it was happening. I remember dreading having to see my grandparents because I knew they'd just start shit. Eventually, we moved to another country, my mother began to put herself back together and learn how to overcome her depression and how to deal with her in-laws. \n\nI have memories of being woken up in the night with my hair being pulled by her, not knowing what was going on or why it was happening.

You have a duty as a married couple to figure out how to work things out or our vows mean nothing. \n\nHOWEVER, my heart breaks for you OP because your husband is not treating you the way a husband should. A husband should always support his wife and have her back. He's acting like he doesn't even want to be around, and he's treating you like a separate being apart from his family. When you guys got married, you two formed a covenant for YOUR family with him. I don't even understand why he married you if he's going to act like he doesn't even want you to be around your in-laws. \n\nI'm sorry, but if I was in your shoes this would be a real big deal-breaker for me. I would still say that you guys need to go through some couples therapy together, but if that doesn't help, or he refuses counseling, I don't think you should subject yourself to this type of behavior from people who are supposed to be your family too. You don't deserve that OP and if he's treating you like that now, when you're still newlyweds basically, he's not going to change. \n\nI also don't understand why he acting like you quietly leaving the vacation and going home was juvenile and selfish, when obviously they didn't want you there anway? I wouldn't say what he's doing is gaslighting you, but he's not giving you a fair chance to express your feelings. You're wrong for listening in on their conversation, but you're also wrong for obliging to how they felt and leaving? How does that make sense?",

He did nothing but talk bad about me to everyone in his life. He had his family hating me. He would talk to other girls about leaving me and dating them instead, then tell me about it in extreme detail. And when I would get upset, he'd go on to everyone about how jealous and controlling I am because I don't want him talking to these other girls. He went to college the semester before me so by the time I got there literally everyone around him hated me. I never even met these people. I spent the whole semester isolated in the dorm room and afraid to interact with anyone. Then when he dumped me, he got the girl he was cheating on me with to hate me. Which I eventually realized is exactly what he did to the girl he dated before me. He had me and everyone else at school absolutely HATING her. Not surprisingly, he's done it to every girl he's been with since. Honestly these aren't even the worst things he did or said, but it's just so embarrassing all the red flags I ignored, I can't even begin to go into all of it. But once I noticed the narcissism and manipulation, it was unbelievable watching it all unfold in front of my eyes. While in the relationship, I was just so close to it and couldn't see it. I was probably an easy target because I lived with alcoholic parents and had no self esteem and always beat myself up for everything. Even years after he broke up with me, I still thought it was all my fault. I thought if I was better and tried harder and wasn't so \"jealous and controlling\" that he might have stayed. Then eventually he started talking to me again and trying to get back together with me. It was then that I started noticing how shitty he made me feel every single time I talked to him and how horribly he talked about everyone else, always painting himself as some kind of hero for being \"so nice\" to people that don't deserve it. It was when he started telling everyone he knew that I was drinking myself to death because I couldn't stand to be apart from him (I was struggling with addiction at the time) and actually proceeded to send me screenshots of these texts that he was sending out, that I finally snapped. It was like everything fell into place in my mind. I told him I didn't want to see him or date him and I was done. He then started hanging out with my old friend group (people that he always talked bad about and said he hated) and posting it all over social media to get back at me. So yeah, a real gem of a guy. Sorry for the rant, reading all this just made it come back to me big time. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAs for the OP, definitely NTA. I think leaving was the right thing to do. The next step should be divorce and finding a guy that doesn't talk crap behind their back. That's the kind of thing that will only get worse.",

If the other spouses are made to feel welcome, she should have been too. What's worse is OP's husband declaring she pushed herself into being invited in front of the rest of the family.

But Mother of Christ on a Donkey, the church FUCKED me UP about sex. I actually used to apologize to partners because I firmly believed I was somehow physically defective and was incapable of have an orgasm. Which did not happen until I was 26 fucking years old.
