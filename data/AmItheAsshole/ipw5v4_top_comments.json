The Principal is a walnut for not just giving the stupidest punishment to a clearly ill seven year old but not sending her to the nurse. And I&#39;m sorry but her Father is also a walnut for siding with the principal! If it was my Father (and late Grandma) they&#39;d would have done what you did.  Also kudos to your daughter for trying to do the right thing, you never know, one of her classmates could have been triggered and started throwing up themselves. Please give her all the hugs from us all and we&#39;re on your side. Good job Mom for being there for her.</p>\n</div>",

Both the adult and paediatric doctors reported the school for neglect too (they asked me when the injury happened, and weren&#39;t impressed when I said lunchtime and that the teacher told me I was fine) </p>\n\n<p>Turns out I had a virus, and was fine over all. When my parents told school the next day, the school were like &quot;Oops. We had 20-odd other kids to deal with&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, my parents were furious and I changed school a year later (after another incident, but we had been waiting for a spot in the other school).</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "When I was in the second grade I was playing on the field with friends at recess. I know we were playing some game but I don\u2019t remember which on. My friend fell to the ground so I ran over to see what\u2019s up, he was laughing. So as I joke I sat on him for a second , then got off and sat next to him. The teacher came RUNNING over and sent me to the principal, I was supper confused. The teacher explained to the principal that I sat on my friend to suffocate him and wouldn\u2019t get off. I was super confused because that\u2019s not what happened. I got suspended for the day and my mom was PISSED but no one would believe me because \u201cthe teacher saw it and if I said otherwise I was calling the teacher a lier!\u201d\n\nFast forward 20 years and my own son is in the second grade. He gets himself into a lot of trouble but one thing is does NOT do is lie. We have an agreement that if he tells me the truth he will not be in trouble, but if he lies, he gets double the punishment. He also just told the truth by default, even if it meant telling him himself lol. Anyways, one day he\u2019s out to recess and his friend went to kick this ball but missed the ball and ending up kicking my son in the stomach. By some miracle my son caught this kids foot and flipped him upside down. Here\u2019s where it goes murky, the teacher said he got down on the ground, sat on the kid and grabbed his neck trying to suffocate the kid, but my son says he was on the ground trying to lift his friend up. I knew my son was telling the truth but the principal called him a liar and said he\u2019s not only a liar but he\u2019s calling the teacher a liar. I was PISSED. They suspended my son for 2 days, and for those 2 days we had nothing but fun. Pizza, ice cream, Redbox movies, candy, the whole Shabang. And I promised to my son that as long as he keeps telling the truth, I will ALWAYS believe him.",

Any other time I would have told her to knock it off, but just that once I made an exception.</p>\n</div>",

While I think it's helpful for an adult to have one in case you lost it/forgot it, it can make for a dangerous situation for a child to not have their own medical devices and have control over when they use them. \n\nI also high-key hated the school rule I had in high school (10 years ago so unsure if this is still a thing), but it was that students weren't allowed to bring painkillers (Aleve, Aspirin, Tylenol, etc.) and we could only get it from the nurse. We didn't even have a full-time nurse. We all broke that rule.\n\nKids aren't stupid and likely know what they need in a medical situation (if they don't, their parents are doing them a disservice). Let them bring and have access to their medical devices and let an adult have one, too, just in case. \n\nIn the case of OP and the vomiting child, how the heck did the teacher not understand that's what she was doing? I've seen the vomit run many a time, and there's no mistaking. Also, that teacher is an idiot if they want that vomit smell in their classroom all day. That lingers.

However, teachers are still held to that if they do something wrong even though most aren't officially trained.  CPR/first aid isn't needed for teaching.  At best I've had a full school seminar with the school nurse saying 'here's an epi pen', but not actually training where you are trained to use it and allowed to simulate use on a dummy.  So because teachers aren't officially trained to use an epi pen they can't be sued for not using one, but because they are said to have to care for students they can be sued if they use one and do it incorrectly.\n\nEdit to add: Yes I would still give an epi pen to a child.  Please stop sending me messages accusing me of murdering my students.  I just wanted to clarify that Good Samaritan is much more complex than people were saying.",
