That being said, while your *information* was correct, your *approach* to correcting her (and her admittedly incredibly harmful TikTok) was wrong, and might only get her to double down and repeat her actions, especially if other people are saying that she did something great. Nobody wants to listen to a person they feel is attacking them at a personal level, and that is exactly what you did. Let me repeat that:\n\n***Nobody wants to listen to a person they feel are attacking them at a personal level, and that is exactly what you did.***\n\nTalk to your parents and get them to back you up when you tell the principal that you will agree to apologize for saying this: \"you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.\"\n\nLanguage and phrasing is important - earlier I got a comment deleted because I unwittingly put the word \"that\" in front of the name that a redditor had used which ended up being perceived as an insult. In my case, it was just a common name that these days is at times used as an insult, but \"dumbass\" is one hundred percent just an insult and you know better. \n\nIf you want ignorant people to be less ignorant, you have to first remember that ***people don't know what they don't know*** unless told otherwise and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. If you had approached her from a compassionate stance, say, \"I know you meant well, but you went about it the wrong way: those fish aren't able to survive in saltwater. However, even if you released them into freshwater, you will just end up hurting all the other fish that live there.\" Explaining why without being nasty is liable to do more good and get her and other people who are ignorant about such issues to pay more attention and not make those mistakes again. After all, at one point, you were once a person who did not know about those issues until you learned about them. At least pretend to give her and the others the benefit of the doubt. Yes, she may have just done it for the TikTok and clout, but then again, she really may have meant well but didn\u2019t know any better. Telling her in a rude way may lead to her not listening to you and thus repeat her actions; explaining in a kind manner would more likely get her to actually listen and rethink her future behavior.",

Let me repeat that:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Nobody wants to listen to a person they feel are attacking them at a personal level, and that is exactly what you did.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Talk to your parents and get them to back you up when you tell the principal that you will agree to apologize for saying this: &quot;you realize you&#39;re actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Language and phrasing is important - earlier I got a comment deleted because I unwittingly put the word &quot;that&quot; in front of the name that a redditor had used which ended up being perceived as an insult. In my case, it was just a common name that these days is at times used as an insult, but &quot;dumbass&quot; is one hundred percent just an insult and you know better. </p>\n\n<p>If you want ignorant people to be less ignorant, you have to first remember that <strong><em>people don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know</em></strong> unless told otherwise and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. If you had approached her from a compassionate stance, say, &quot;I know you meant well, but you went about it the wrong way: those fish aren&#39;t able to survive in saltwater. However, even if you released them into freshwater, you will just end up hurting all the other fish that live there.&quot; Explaining why without being nasty is liable to do more good and get her and other people who are ignorant about such issues to pay more attention and not make those mistakes again. After all, at one point, you were once a person who did not know about those issues until you learned about them. At least pretend to give her and the others the benefit of the doubt. Yes, she may have just done it for the TikTok and clout, but then again, she really may have meant well but didn\u2019t know any better. Telling her in a rude way may lead to her not listening to you and thus repeat her actions; explaining in a kind manner would more likely get her to actually listen and rethink her future behavior.</p>\n</div>",

You aren't a bully, you are a thoughtful person. Your knowledge and care are far more important than this girl wanting to feel like she has done something good (and more importantly tell everyone about it) regardless of the actual rightness of her actions; which in this case were murderous and wrong. I think you should try and get your parents to understand your position. You will have to recognize that calling her a dumbass was wrong (it wasn't but you will need to concede this point to further your case. This is how the world works when you are an adult, it sucks but you need to do it), but say it was a reaction to how genuinely hurt you were to learn about this terrible act.

You aren&#39;t a bully, you are a thoughtful person. Your knowledge and care are far more important than this girl wanting to feel like she has done something good (and more importantly tell everyone about it) regardless of the actual rightness of her actions; which in this case were murderous and wrong. I think you should try and get your parents to understand your position. You will have to recognize that calling her a dumbass was wrong (it wasn&#39;t but you will need to concede this point to further your case. This is how the world works when you are an adult, it sucks but you need to do it), but say it was a reaction to how genuinely hurt you were to learn about this terrible act.

I would say the ideal confrontation is you ask to talk with them privately, convey how serious you take the topic of fish and wildlife, explain how severely misguided they are, and then maybe explain how they can actually help animals.  I know this sounds like a very HR way of handling it but there's a reason they do it like this and there's a lot of social research behind it.  And in the event they brush everything you just said off you break off the friendship. Overall I still don't think your position is wrong but I can see why your facing consequences.",

I genuinely find it alarming that so many people are telling this kid that it\u2019s perfectly fine to speak to someone that way in a setting like a school where there are explicit rules and behavioral standards that specifically say otherwise. I\u2019m picturing how this exact scenario would likely unfold for OP if it had happened at a workplace instead of a school, and I don\u2019t think OP would enjoy the result there either. The school is trying to teach kids how to successfully navigate public spaces and work spaces, and one fairly standard thing that we expect from other people is that they won\u2019t insert themselves into other people\u2019s conversations to announce that one of those people is a dumbass. It\u2019s not like OP had to choose between staying silent or calling this girl names.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>\u201cSchools are meant to teach. They not only teach information, but how to be better people. ESH.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Yes, exactly this! I genuinely find it alarming that so many people are telling this kid that it\u2019s perfectly fine to speak to someone that way in a setting like a school where there are explicit rules and behavioral standards that specifically say otherwise. I\u2019m picturing how this exact scenario would likely unfold for OP if it had happened at a workplace instead of a school, and I don\u2019t think OP would enjoy the result there either. The school is trying to teach kids how to successfully navigate public spaces and work spaces, and one fairly standard thing that we expect from other people is that they won\u2019t insert themselves into other people\u2019s conversations to announce that one of those people is a dumbass. It\u2019s not like OP had to choose between staying silent or calling this girl names.

You have classes with different schedules in college, and people eat around them when they can. There might be certain times of day when they&#39;re serving lunch, but it&#39;s not a scheduled thing like seems to be described here. This reads like middle or high school to me.</p>\n\n<p>So all the people in here hating on her for trying to get &quot;clout&quot; are, I think, ignoring the fact that these girls are trying to fit in in the social media age.

It also rallies smaller donations for that reason and because they might want to feel associated with something that a person or organization they admire supports. Yes, there is \"greenwashing\" going on and plenty of it, but solid organizations guard against being used as props, and should be suspicious of large sources of funding that seem to fall out of the sky.",
