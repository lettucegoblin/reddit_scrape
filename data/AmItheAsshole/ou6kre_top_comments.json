Bea keeps calling me out on it though and she's very condescending about it, she keeps saying i am just having a phase and she keeps offering me bites of her lunch that contain cheese and meat, and when i refuse she just goes \"oh come on, its vegan i promise!\" *winkwink*. Its very childish and annoying and even other people asked her to tone it down, but she insists shes just joking. \n\nLast week she brought a homemade cake to the office for her birthday, and when she put a slice down in front of me i politely thanked her but i said i cant eat that. She said the cake is vegan and she made it specifically so i could eat it, but knowing her very loose definition of vegan i asked a few questions about the ingredients and she didnt check any of them for milk or eggs, so I thanked her again but refused the slice.

Some brands may use egg white so check.\n\nFlour can also be problematic in that some flours can have L-cysteine (animal hair) but in the UK (at least pre Brexit) needed to be specified on the packaging either as L-cysteine or E920.

        "body": "Somehow I had missed this story! Thank you for introducing me to it!\n\nWhen I was a child, my family lived in the very tippy top of Minnesota. My dad was... a special man. He loved to do anything and everything and learn on the way. He was good at it, too- he built most of our house, did all the plumbing, the electrical stuff, built the garage, he did our auto work, and built our computers back in the early 90's, he even dug his own sewage system/drainfield (I helped dig lol) and set it up and it all worked out pretty well, lucky for our family!\n\n One of his hobbies was making maple syrup. We didn't have enough maples on our property, but most land up there isn't owned by anyone, so he had found a massive maple grove a few miles away that we used without issue. I was the youngest of three girls, and a total daddy's girl, so I was his worker bee- my sister's weren't interested, but I wanted to do anything he did! He taught me how to treat the trees with care so they could be used again, and set taps by myself after he would hand-drill the holes. I recall the taste of that icy cold sap, it was incredibly delicious. The only thing better was sap that was about a third of the way boiled or so- still watery-thin, but turning slightly brown and sweeter than sap. That is still the most delicious thing I can name to this day. I'll probably never get another chance to try that hot delicious slightly-boiled stuff again, but it was amazing, especially on a chilly day keeping an eye on the outside boiler. It took like three days I think, to boil off. Dad used an old cut-out hot water heater for the pot boiler.\n\nAnyway, back then I used to think everyone's dad made syrup every year. I had NO idea you could buy it! I recall when I first realized as a kid- I saw a label on the bottle at someone's house, and said \"they made such pretty labels for thier bottles\"! They were a bit confused lol.\n\nIt was also another few months before I also realized that people's dads are NOT all plumbers/electricians/homebuilders/mechanics/computer builders (dad was a self-taught skilled programmer) wrapped up in one, and that most people just HIRE those people- and that a plumber cannot also do electrical work. This fact was discovered at a friend's house- they told me they had to have the water off all day while waiting for someone to come fix the burst broken pipe that the next day. I confusedly asked \"Why do you have to wait? Why doesn't your dad fix it?\" (He was home) they were... a bit confused at first by my question. I guess I thought dads just came pre-programmed with all that knowledge \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Clearing agents either form a scummy skin or absorb the junk and fall out of the liquid as a precipitate. In either case, mechanical removal is possible. In skins, you just skin off the top layer until the skin no longer forms. In precipitates, you can either filter the liquid or drain the tank above the precipitate level and then discard the remaining sludge from the bottom of the container.\n\nThe issue is that eventually with this philosophy of listing everything you end up not just supplying a list of what is in the final product but a list of everything used in the process.  Coffee doesn\u2019t have to list what it was filtered through: disposable paper, reusable plastic, and reusable metal filters exist.  Could someone object to their coffee being filtered through a nylon filter? Sure. Could they argue there\u2019s a chance that there might be trace amounts of some chemical in there? Sure. But the same is true of paper filters and the chemicals used to treat paper, and metal filters can in theory Leah minute amounts of ions. All are basically undetectable unless the filter is defective. Coffee goes through so many processing steps that you\u2019d need a multi-page document to say what they all are, and then you\u2019d be bogged down in technical notation about things like various stainless steel alloys used in various points.\n\nNow the FDA/USDA and Canada\u2019s equivalent can rule that best practice for processes involves not using some methods. For example, commercial processes avoid using wood when there is a functional equivalent that is metal or plastic. Metal and plastic aren\u2019t absorbent like wood and thus reduce risks. In other cases, like cheese baking and whisky aging, this absorbent nature is key to the process and there isn\u2019t a valid alternative.

It\u2019s fairly easy to add gelatin and then coagulate it out again and in doing so the gelatin will stick to a number of things in the raw mix. This gets you solid gelatin filled with impurities and a cleaner liquid on top. Separate the two and you can use the solid gelatin as animal feed and sell the cleaned liquid to humans.\n\nThere are other options, like mechanical filtering or chemical precipitation, but those aren\u2019t fit for certain application in the same way that gelatin isn\u2019t fit for all applications.  There are also non-animal substitutes that can do similar things to gelatin, but using them is often somewhat different. Pectins are a decent direct replacement, but they\u2019re not perfect.\n\nAlso note that in the US, there are protected and unprotected labeling terms. Protected terms like \u201corganic\u201d cannot be used unless the product meets a government standard, while unprotected terms like \u201call-natural\u201d have no legally defined meaning. The only way to fight against an unprotected term is to sue for deceptive marketing practice and win, which is a time-consuming and expensive task.",
