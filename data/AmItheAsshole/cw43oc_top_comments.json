The OP was having a gathering for family and friends. Your family and friends should not be putting you in a position where you may need to replace their expensive items. Before bringing or wearing something expensive (and unnecessary) you should check with the host on whether they want to take responsibility for that item being there. Or if you don't, then if something happens to it (unless someone purposely destroys it and the destroyer is he one held responsible) you can't reasonably expect someone to pay for you to replace it. A reasonable amount to pay to replace a shirt, no matter how nice, is $250 max. It doesn't matter if I accidentally bump into you with red wine, it's a dick move to expect your family/friends to pay exorbitant amounts because you have expensive tastes. If you want to wear clothes that are so much more expensive and fragile than what is normal then you are accepting the risk of that decision. Seriously, don't even put your family and friends in that position. Accidents do happen. And yes, I would refuse to pay that much to replace a shirt even if I was at fault for an accident unless informed prior to anything happening that she was wearing an expensive/fragile garment.

Seems like she has worked hard for the things she has and probably in her career appearance matters. Also someone who hasn't been around children wouldn't know how much babies puke. You should have warned her about what could happen. In the end if your child ruins something it's up to you to pay for it even if it's not directly your fault. For instance if your baby puked in an Uber you would still be expected to pay for it.\n\nShe's an asshole about the way she reacted but if my shirt was ruined I would also be upset.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are replying that it's common knowledge that babies puke. And while that might be true many people who haven't interacted with them might not expect them to puke ALL the time. I'm an only child and while I've had baby cousins I don't remember them puking on anyone. I always thought that babies puked right after feeding or if their tummy is upset. But now thanks to reddit I know better and will avoid holding babies.",

I am German and here, this only counts if your child is 7 or older and if you have neglected your duties in overseeing them (for example not looking after them at all while they burnt something down). There are insurances that pay if you got one that covers smaller children (we have one), but legally you're not on the hook. Reasoning is that children under 7 are not an extension of their parents, but their own person who is not old enough to be liable for any wrongdoing.\nExample: one of my kids accidentally knocked a pedestrian off her feet when he fell from his bike. She was elderly and needed stitches. Our insurance paid for her because we wanted them to and because we had the insurance, but by law here in Germany, her own health insurance would have had to cover it (but was glad to take our insurance's money).\n\nTo make a mother pay out of pocket for an outrageously expensive piece of clothing because a BABY spit on it is so absurd.",
