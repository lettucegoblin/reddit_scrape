I was a freelancer for 10 years before that and also made very good money - so i can afford things like a big apartment and so on and so forth.\n\nI stopped talking about the money i earn, including to family because it causes envy and lots of revulsion - in my case mostly from the husbands or boyfriends of my female friends or male relatives. They dont get how a woman can earn this much money (scandalous!!!) bc they compare themselves and 99% of them earn 2/3 of what i earn at best.\n\nEven though i find it ridiculous and shameful for them, i kinda get it.\n\nLets face it: Salary is not something that is fair. A nurse, kindergarden-teacher etc. earn much less, but their jobs are at least as important or stressful as mine. The reasons why i earn this much, is bc in the industry i work in there is big money and specialized people earn lots of money. Good for me! Yes, i earned this through hard work and education and even more hard work - but do i earn it more than my sister who is a very skilled kindergarden-teacher or a nurse? Of course not.\n\nAnd those people who get aggitated are comparing themselves with you (and in your case your young age), remember what they earned then and what they earn now and start feeling bad about themselves and find it unfair. Its their problem that they cant take a step back and see the big picture, but you can in the future prevent these kind of conflicts or people having bad feelings if you just dont specifically talk about the exact amount.\n\nAs i said: you are not responsible for the feelings of other people, due to your success - but if you want a peaceful life: Dont give out the exact amount, stay vague and say: i earn quite well for my age or i earn good and put money aside or whatever.\n\n(Unless you want to annoy someone - then go ahead. Who asks, gets the answer they deserve) ;)\n\nPS: english is not my native language.\n\nPPS: i just saw that you are female. Young, female AND sucessful that is even more scandalous!!!!! ;) good for you - you rock!\n\nEdit: Wow guys, thanks for the awards! That is really lovely and kind! <3",

You continue to smile as you go to get a refill, utterly ignoring his subsequent explosion.  Don sunglasses as you walk out of frame.  -Fin-</p>\n</div>",

They always hired me bc i had a good name and reputation and they were always more than satisfied with the results of my work. But every time i billed them i got a snide remark. \n\nThe best one was one guy who asked me: \"Dont you have a boyfriend? Why do you need so much money?\" \n\nMe: I have a boyfriend, he's a freelancer too and earns half of what i earn so i need to feed him.\n\nHe: Must be emasculating for him, i wonder why he does that to himself...\n\nMe: Yeah, thats me. Emasculating as many men as possible on my way to world dominance.\n\nOf course that was the first and last job i did for that company, i immediately blacklisted them. They kept calling me for years afterwards for projects, but i was always \"busy\" and \"booked out\" already.\n\nAhhh, the world as a female in business. Fun. Fun. Fun.\n\nDont get me wrong: Not all men are like that. And i like men. But woah, there are so many misogynistic a-holes to deal with. It seems to get better with the \"younger\" generation - or maybe that is just because i have so much seniority now, that they respect me. But i want to have hope.
