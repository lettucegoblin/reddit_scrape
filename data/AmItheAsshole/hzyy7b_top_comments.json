You might find yourself at home in the subreddit r/justnofamily (or r/raisedbyborderlines or r/raisedbynarcissists if your parents are not just enablers of that bullshit, but active participants in that type of abuse, which by the way black-and-white splitting of your kids into golden child and scapegoat totally qualifies for)\n\n- it could have been solved easily by your sister culling the list herself for a very good and impersonal reason (\u201esorry, we need to cut the list as a pandemic is going on, but we\u2018d appreciate celebrating with you after this is over, maybe at our first or second anniversary?\u201c) but she decided to go the utterly degrading, humiliating, personal route of making people jump through hoops, lick her wedding pumps and crawl up her ass. That\u2018s peak bridezilla.\n\n- If culling the list herself was not an option, she could have always asked for a new RSVP with \u201eplease take into account whether you\u2018re willing to travel during a global pandemic\u201c, that would have weeded out a lot of the guests without making anyone feel bad. Then again she seems to be exactly the type of person who would take any type of \u201esorry, can\u2018t make it/sorry, won\u2018t risk my health and life for you\u201c as a major slight that has to be corrected by utterly destroying the person who did this to her fragile ego or removing and discarding them from her social life entirely (again, if that\u2018s a pattern this qualifies as pathological and she should, but with her inflated sense of self never will, see a trained specialist about it).\n\n- again, your parents backing her up and then threatening you is so majorly fucked up that I beg you to just distance yourself from the whole crazy lot of them\n\n- nobody except your parents and the grooms\u2019s parents will come because nobody will think a wedding is worth the hassle of 500 word application essays. This will cause a whole other meltdown in your sister and her inflated ego, so maybe bask in that imagination for the time being until it\u2018s clear that this is how this bullshit will play out (I bet she\u2018ll then postpone the wedding once more, only digging her grave deeper because for the third invite, it\u2018ll be obvious she\u2018s just doing it for the attention and fake praise of as many people as possible). Going to your bridezilla sister\u2018s wedding is not the honour she thinks it is and she\u2018ll delightfully (for you) brake with her face if she doesn\u2018t get her shit straight this hot minute. It\u2018ll be a great show to watch. Try to disentangle yourself emotionally from this bullshit and just watch the implosion from a safe, enjoyable distance.\n\n\noptions for dealing with the essay in maliciously compliant or just justifiedly malicious ways (that *will* cause the whole thing to go full nuclear, so don\u2019t do it if you want your family to stay the dysfunctional way it is because you can\u2019t take even more drama) include:\n\n- \u201ebecause you made me\u201c/\u201ebecause our parents are threatening me if I don\u2018t fill this lunatic Bullshit out\u201c or \u201ebridezilla\u201c over and over until you reach the word mark\n\n- \u201eI don\u2018t know why I should go, but maybe you explain to me why I should come given that you have proven to be [lenghty paragraph about her inflated ego, the pandemic, her abusive bullshit...]\u201c\n\n- make sure that your equally lunatic mom *does not* write that essay for you, because she *will* try to pull that bullshit to \u201esave face\u201c.\n\n- an honest essay answering the question \u201edo you really think anyone is dumb enough to jump through your hoops for the fake \u201ehonour\u201c of being at your overpriced, money-grabbing wedding that they have to pay travel costs and gifts and dresses and overnight stays for themselves and whatnot, risking their lives travelling in the midst of a lethal global pandemic just to entertain your false idea of being the most important person in the world?\u201c instead\n\n- just submit a detailed list of your expenses. She won\u2019t be budged by that too much because she feels entitled to everyone spending a shitload of money on her and making her feel special and mighty, but it might make her just upset enough to blow your family up even more. *If* (big if!) you wanna go full nuclear, might at least mess around with them assholes a bit, huh?\n\n- turn the question around and ask her in that essay why she doesn\u2018t value your (or anybodies\u2018) attendance if she\u2018s making people jump through hoops, just showing them they\u2018re all replaceable. \n\n- Write an essay on what you\u2018re going to do with the money you\u2018re not spending on her wedding now\n\n- Hand in your work CV as a prank and if confronted say \u201eyou asked people to apply so that\u2018s what I did\u201c\n\n- Lorem impsum the shit out of that essay\n\n- copy and Paste the most cringeworthy r/relationships post (or the most applicable answer to your situation from that sub) you can remember in there, or copy and paste some links to ridiculous bridezilla stories in there. I think there\u2018s even a r/bridezilla sub, but r/relationships and r/AITA have plenty as well! \n\n- Just write that you\u2018ll save yourself the hassle for her next wedding in ten years because that\u2018s what usually happens to people with inflated egos like hers (then to fill the word mark give some examples on why you think so, related to that wedding planning, but wish her well with her future husband who\u2018s likely her same flavour of crazy or too much of a doormat to save himself from bridezilla)\n\n\nGood luck, and if you\u2018re fed up with the entire lot, have some fun messing with them for good.",

In fact, I'd wager that (in your eyes, at least) they are all merely disposable photo props in your ongoing Bridezilla quest for the 'pErFeCt wEdDiNg dAy!!!!!'

'Oh yes, my life will be forever changed by watching my sister traipse around like a pampered show poodle in a ring, believing that she is somehow 'deserving' of all the same attention and fanfare of a sentient orange in a toupee winning the presidential election!'  Seriously- thousands of girls around the world get married EVERY DAY.

After all, I'm surely not the only person being roped into this event by threat of emotional blackmail, right?  I mean, mom and dad promised, \"if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big f\\*cking trouble with all our relatives, so just write the essays.\"  So I guess this is just a part of being in our 'family'- having to brown nose a 'diva' rather than being given automatic assurance that I have a spot in my sister's wedding and life.  After all, you're insisting that *everyone* prances in your little pony show, despite not having enough room for us all, so I'm guessing I'm not the only one who will end up resenting and avoiding you following the event.

The nerve!</p>\n\n<p>I actually <em>would</em> write the essay.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a bet going with other family and friends, who also agree you\u2019re embarrassing yourself.  They\u2019re all outdoing themselves to write the most over-the-top, flowery, kiss-ass load of horse crap possible for their essays, and we\u2019re betting on whether you\u2019re actually vain enough to believe it and invite them.  So yeah, I need to go to the wedding so I can settle up on the bets from the other attendees.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And if you really want to guild the lily, the second essay can imply that the betting pool has gotten quite large, and as her sibling and official wedding bookie, you might be willing to cut her in if she\u2019d (wink wink) <em>look the other way</em> on some key invites.  I mean, what could be better than demanding that your family &amp; friends stroke your ego to \u2018earn\u2019 wedding re-invites AND getting a big payday from scamming them, too, amirite!?  There could be an even bigger betting pool/payday involved for her if she would agree to publish all the essays, and force the wedding attendees to vote on the \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d ones.

I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.\n\nAnyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they\u2019re cutting capacity by half. As a result she\u2019s sending out \u201cre-invites\u201d that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she\u2019s asking all guests to submit 500-word \u201cessays\u201d to two questions. The gist is that they\u2019ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people\u2019s enthusiasm. People who don\u2019t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.\n\nI just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren\u2019t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like \u201dwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us?\u201d So she\u2019s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. \n\nAnyways I told her in advance I\u2019m not writing 1000 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She\u2019s said that to keep things fair if I don\u2019t fill out the RSVP correctly I won\u2019t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big fucking trouble so just write the essays. \n\nAITA if I stay stubborn on this?

It&#39;s phenomenal how selfish this is.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly I&#39;d probably get the same Heat from my family if I didn&#39;t go to my sister&#39;s wedding if she has one, but I wouldn&#39;t go. I wouldn&#39;t play into this at all it&#39;s nonsense. I would also say don&#39;t send a gift either. Call me old-fashioned but I thought the premise of why you gave newlyweds gifts because they are starting a new life and probably can&#39;t afford lots of stuff, so more established people help them out. This doesn&#39;t sound like the case given that you are being asked to grovel to attend their destination wedding.</p>\n</div>",

But It is their wedding &amp; if that is what they have their hearts set on, then more power to them. I will just not be there unfortunately.</p>\n</div>",
