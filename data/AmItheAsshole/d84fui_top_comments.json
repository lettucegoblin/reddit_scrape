I'm not a father but if someone I love would push me away like that for what would seem like no reason for me and not even tell me why, I would feel heartbroken and yes, upset too so I think your reaction here is not only reasonable but also very human and I don't think any father who loves their child and wants to support and help their child on this planet would have reacted any other way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for you acting distant: I won't assume you're doing thins because you're being petty as it is just as likely you're acting out because you're deeply hurt by idk... your own goddamn child not trusting you (but hey, apparently everyone on this sub automatically magically knows why you're being distant because it can only be explained by pettiness, right?) and I will side with what a lot of people are saying here... if your child doesn't trust you there must be some sort of reason and in this case the best thing you could do is to be closer to him and be more caring rather than be more distant... if you really care about improving the relationship with your child that's what you'll do and if you're just being petty and childish - dude, just drop it, you're being a bad example to your kid and are most likely hurting him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally my main point: nobody on this entire sub can tell you whether you are an asshole or not solely based on what little information you provided, myself included because what you posted is  lacks context, this could just be a teen being difficult and lashing out out of the blue or it could be a result of a long lasting issue of which you (or anyone else for that matter) could have been the cause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMO you should talk to your wife and ask if you are the problem in this scenario or if there's any way you can help or support your son in this, she talked to your kid so she should have more context.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the people jumping to conclusions and shitting on you calling you an asshole: shame on you guys, if you wanna  play witch hunts go to another sub.",

He&#39;s a hormone raging teenager, this can bring on episodes of extreme mood changes &amp; it could just be one of those. It could be mental health, it could be over a falling out with a friend, it could be anything. But whether he&#39;s told you or your wife, at least he&#39;s told one of you &amp; may have asked for them to respect his privacy.\nHe may find his mum more emotionally available, e.g. sympathetic/empathetic so yeah, he opened up to his mum. That&#39;s no insult to you, but you being distant is just enforcing that he can&#39;t go to you with whatever is upsetting him. Just be kind &amp; sympathetic, even though you don&#39;t know what is wrong.\nAnd calmly &amp; tactfully tell your wife your feelings on being kept out of the loop with what&#39;s going on with your son.</p>\n</div>",

How does that in any way contradict my comment? \n\nBecause you suggest the wife's the asshole for not doing \"enough\" to satisfy OP's curiosity, when that has nothing to do with the question, in my eyes. \n\nNowhere has OP stated that he's upset because his wife didn't do enough to alleviate his concerns (without telling the whole thing), but he has clearly stated that he's upset that his son has confided in his wife over him (title). \n\nWhether you choose to infer that he simply wanted to be reassured by his wife is up to you, but since his post says nothing about voicing such concerns to her and doesn't even write such concerns here, I'm working from the assumption that he's less upset about that and more about not being the parent who knows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I never said that he's upset with only his wife, and being upset with  the wife is not mutually exclusive from being upset with the situation  in general, which is what OP is talking about. \n\nAnd OP being upset about the situation, while understandable, isn't the wife's fault or the son's fault (IMO), yet he's taking it out on both of them, and from his post he seems to have done so, knowingly, since he admits that he hasn't been \"fully ignoring\" them. Maybe we simply disagree on how to read his statement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Also, being upset with the situation in general, which can include being  both worried and annoyed, tends to make people distant sometimes. \n\nYou choose to interpret it as concern for his son's well-being, I choose to interpret it as being angry about not being the one his son confides in. Only OP knows which it is, and he might not even be sure. But if he *is* concerned, I still maintain he's showing it in an asshole way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  By \"pressing it\" I'm referring to whatever dynamic that's been going on  with the family since yesterday. I suppose it could be true that OP has  literally been completely and utterly silent about this matter from the  point where his son was upset up until the wife getting mad, but I would  assume that some words were spoken on OP's end before she reacted by  getting upset. \n\nThere's nothing suggesting that OP brought up the subject again and that caused her get angry. There's just as big a likelihood that OP took his wife's words of \"dropping it\" to a more extreme conclusion and decided to drop all subjects and only gave one word answers, until his wife had enough and called him on it.\n\nRegardless, I think he acted immature and I don't think it's the wife's fault or the son's. I believe that if he really wants to have his son's confidence, that's between him and his son, and trying to weasel the info out of his wife is probably going to do the exact opposite.",
