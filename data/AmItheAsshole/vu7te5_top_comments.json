Actually, no, even a 12 year would be more understanding. \n\nFirst of all, he lacks understanding for your workload and behaves like a f\\*cking puppy, instead of supporting you and trying to make this period as easy as possible. I am willing to bet if roles were reversed, he'd act as if he's Atlas carrying the world on his back. \n\nSecond of all, you sure you want a partner who is so ready to take revenge?

        "body": "So this is a manipulation tactic called [DARVO (Deny Attack Reverse Victim Offender)](https://www.banyantherapy.com/darvo/). It\u2019s something that manipulative people and abusers commonly use when they are called out for doing something wrong to someone. It goes like this: \n\n1.\t **Deny**. After being called out on their bad behavior an abuser may deny that they did what they did, or if they do admit to doing the behavior they will say that it was justified. They do this by either claiming that the victim is remembering what happened wrong, claim that the victim is lying, or that their victim *deserved* what happened because of something the victim did. \n2.\t**Attack**. The abuser attacks/questions the victim\u2019s reaction to the abuser\u2019s behavior. \n3.\t**Reverse**. The abuser shifts the focus of the conversation from what the abuser *did* to how the victim *reacted* to what they abuser did. \n4.\t**Victim**. The abuser will now claim to be the victim in the scenario. \n5.\t**Offender**. The victim is now \u201cthe bad guy\u201d and fells that they have to justify their reaction to the abuser\u2019s behavior, and that they must console the abuser\u2019s feelings. \n\nYour story is a pretty clear example of DARVO:\n\n-\tDeny: \u201ctil my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time.\u201d\n-\tAttack: \u201cHe kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling\u201d\n-\tReverse Victim & Offender: \u201cthat I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it\u201c\n\n>\tAnd that **I deserve what he did** since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks\u2026 **his way of \u201cteaching me a lesson\u201d** was not right.\n\nThis attitude of you \u201cdeserving\u201d to be punished is textbook red flag abuser mentality. **It is not normal or healthy for one partner to \u201cpunish\u201d the other in a relationship**.

It can be disappointing cuz I love spending time with her but I'm so proud of what she's doing and support how hard she's working. Your husband only cares about himself. This type of behavior won't get better the longer you're together, and as I said if he's willing to jeopardize your future over something like this then I'd be rethinking the relationship. You deserve better. If the tables were turned I doubt you would be this mean and vengeful.\n\nETA: absolutely 100000% NTA",

I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.\n\n\n\nThe day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.\n\n\nBefore I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. \n\nThey didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.\n\n\nI went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of \"teaching me a lesson\" was not right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I ordered books to study for the LSAT and they were delivered while I was at school so he refused delivery. He denied it and said it must have been delivered to the wrong house, which does happen a lot in our area since it's rural and maps frequently gets people lost. I had the books delivered to work and enrolled in a prep course. He tried to tell me I couldn't stay up late studying because I had to go to bed when he did. I stayed up late studying anyway. Then he tried to tell me that I had to get up when he did and when I wouldn't, he started slamming the Keurig on the counter in the mornings. I slowly started moving things out and avoided going home and then he accused me of cheating. I also missed a lot of events so I could study or work and he would lie to his family and friends about why I wasn't there. There were other ways he tried to isolate and manipulate me as well. Needless to say, we didn't live together for very long and I'm so glad I ran as fast as I could because I was able to follow my goals to become an attorney and I have an amazing life partner who supports me and my aspirations even after moving in together.",

        "body": "Yes, there is. Abusers go through four basic steps: Find out exactly what you want, pretend to be exactly what you want, get you as deeply committed as possible so you'll have trouble backing out when you start seeing red flags, then gradually start finding out what they can get away with in terms of taking power over your life.\n\nYou can block them at steps 1 and 3 so that you never have to deal with escaping from them at step 4.\n\nStep 1: An important way to protect yourself from ever getting into a relationship with an abuser in the first place is to get to know as much about people as you can in contexts where they can't pretend to be exactly what you want. This means contexts where you're not the only audience or necessarily the most important audience they're speaking to, and contexts where they don't yet know much about what you want from them. If doing online dating, look for dating sites that have more lengthy and informative profiles that are visible to everyone; avoid situations where you're immediately getting to know a person via private, one-to-one conversations alone. You need to verify at a very early stage who this person is with other people, not just who they are with you.\n\nStep 3: Delay anything that tends to make you feel committed (and thus less able to heed red flags) to give yourself the best possible opportunity to spot any red flags while you still feel very able to heed them. What makes you personally feel committed can vary, but you probably have a good idea of what your personal commitment-triggers are. Possibilities include meeting in person, kissing, having sex, divulging deep secrets, discussing a long-term future together, etc. Whatever makes it harder for you personally to heed red flags and decide that a person isn't right for you, don't do those things until you've first had a thorough look around to make sure there are no red flags. And if you did step 1 correctly, that look around should not start out with you giving them lots of information about what you hope to see and them making sure that's what you do see.",

Abusers go through four basic steps: Find out exactly what you want, pretend to be exactly what you want, get you as deeply committed as possible so you&#39;ll have trouble backing out when you start seeing red flags, then gradually start finding out what they can get away with in terms of taking power over your life.</p>\n\n<p>You can block them at steps 1 and 3 so that you never have to deal with escaping from them at step 4.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: An important way to protect yourself from ever getting into a relationship with an abuser in the first place is to get to know as much about people as you can in contexts where they can&#39;t pretend to be exactly what you want. This means contexts where you&#39;re not the only audience or necessarily the most important audience they&#39;re speaking to, and contexts where they don&#39;t yet know much about what you want from them. If doing online dating, look for dating sites that have more lengthy and informative profiles that are visible to everyone; avoid situations where you&#39;re immediately getting to know a person via private, one-to-one conversations alone. You need to verify at a very early stage who this person is with other people, not just who they are with you.</p>\n\n<p>Step 3: Delay anything that tends to make you feel committed (and thus less able to heed red flags) to give yourself the best possible opportunity to spot any red flags while you still feel very able to heed them. What makes you personally feel committed can vary, but you probably have a good idea of what your personal commitment-triggers are. Possibilities include meeting in person, kissing, having sex, divulging deep secrets, discussing a long-term future together, etc. Whatever makes it harder for you personally to heed red flags and decide that a person isn&#39;t right for you, don&#39;t do those things until you&#39;ve first had a thorough look around to make sure there are no red flags. And if you did step 1 correctly, that look around should not start out with you giving them lots of information about what you hope to see and them making sure that&#39;s what you do see.</p>\n</div>",

What I have done is drilled the warning signs of abusive relationships into my godchildren and younger cousins and every young person who feels comfortable with the conversation.
