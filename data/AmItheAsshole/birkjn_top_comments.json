I haven't read every reply to your post yet, so sorry if this is a duplicate of someone else's advice / observations.\n\nYou mention that you have an 80+ hour work week and that your wife has stated concerns that she feels you are losing attraction towards her, has been generally rude, mean, insulting, etc., and now has subjected you to a \"faithfulness\" test, which you passed because you are NTA in that area of your married life as well.\n\nI think all of this behavior is completely related, and comes from deep-seated insecurities your wife has that her pregnancy is making worse.  The loyalty test suggested by her friend may have been less of a \"mind your own business\" violation, and more of the friend finding a way to get your wife to see that her suspicions were baseless. You don't mention how long the friend has been around in you and your wife's life, but I just have a gut feeling that the friend knew you would pass the test, and suggested it in order to clearly prove to your wife her suspicions were untrue.\n\nOf course, I could be 100% wrong, because I don't know any of you in real life. But on the off chance that what I am saying makes sense, you might want to consider that your wife is struggling with depression / poor self-esteem that her pregnancy (with the weight gain, dramatic body shape changes, and lots and lots of hormones) is exacerbating. \n\nNow, like some others have commented, pregnancy and hormones does not equal a free pass for such terrible behavior on the part of your wife, but does give you some insight into what might be driving it.  You must decide if you can offer forgiveness to your for such a transgression.  Personally, I hope that you can. If so, you probably shouldn't kick your pregnant wife to the curb.  If you are finding all of this to be unforgivable at this point, you should still try to continue to support her during her pregnancy with your daughter, even if you need some distance to sort everything out.\n\nMan, this is a crappy situation that you are in, and I truly hope you are able to work things out in a positive fashion. I wish you the very best of luck with everything and truly hope you two can move beyond this in time. Good luck!",

Was she like this before getting pregnant or is this truly out of the blue like you imply?\n\nHormones can make people act crazy, but there's no excuse for her being cruel to you. Getting irritated more easily is one thing while pregnant, constantly lashing out and being malicious is another. \n\nI totally get why you feel betrayed and hurt by her stupid test. I don't know if jumping straight to kicking her out is the answer, though. If pregnancy has made her personality do a 180, she should talk to her OB doctor about it and how to better handle it. If she was always sneaky and insecure and harsh, then that might be a different case. Frankly, I think you need couples counseling either way.

Was she like this before getting pregnant or is this truly out of the blue like you imply?</p>\n\n<p>Hormones can make people act crazy, but there&#39;s no excuse for her being cruel to you. Getting irritated more easily is one thing while pregnant, constantly lashing out and being malicious is another. </p>\n\n<p>I totally get why you feel betrayed and hurt by her stupid test. I don&#39;t know if jumping straight to kicking her out is the answer, though. If pregnancy has made her personality do a 180, she should talk to her OB doctor about it and how to better handle it. If she was always sneaky and insecure and harsh, then that might be a different case. Frankly, I think you need couples counseling either way. She is not acknowledging how terrible her behavior is, and she needs to. If you love her and believe that this is not her true personality, therapy is the first stop.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "You know, this definitely hits home with an experience I had. About a few years ago, back when that KiK app was popular, around that time I dated this girl named Brittany. \n\nThe first 3 months we're so awesome and I legit thought this girl would've easily been someone I saw a future with. Now I know the time was short, but I knew her for a while before we even dated. She legit showed no signs of what typical females are like today, not at all. \n\nAnyways, back to the story. About three months into the relationship, I one day get a random message from a girl on KiK. So I simply talked to her and all was cool, until she relentlessly made advances on me. Asked me to send her pics and shit like that. I sent her a regular picture of me and she asked for a nude. This is when I broke it to her that I was seeing someone. I told her she was pretty and she could pretty much have any guy. So after that, this random chick stopped talking. \n\nLater that night, Brittany called me and blew the fuck up on me, and I already knew what it was, just because it seemed like an obvious setup. So I let Brittany get her words out and she said don't talk to me and we're done and all that shit. Because I admittedly only complimented the girl. It wasn't me advancing on the girl, I simply thought it would be a nice thing to say. That girl was besties with Brittany. \n\nIronically, Brittany was also best friends with another girl, who was my best friends girlfriend. My buddies girlfriend told me that she was talking to some guy in jail. I knew this way before this all happened, but I never said anything because I thought this guy was her honest friend, but I realized something was off because Brittany never mentioned him, ever. I also didn't say anything because I wanted to use this info just in case of something like this, so I did. \n\nThe next day she again goes off on me because I didn't say much after we argued and I thought I'd give her her own space. I told her, \"since you're here testing my loyalty with your friend, who's your friend in jail you never talked about?\" I said, \"yeah, seems the script has flipped on you huh?\" \n\nI went off on her ass and then she automatically starts apologizing profusely and asking if we can try again, even asked how I knew this and all. I just said that it didn't matter and we are done and I don't want shit to do with you. \n\nAbout 3 months ago, she messaged me trying to talk to me again and I told her that I'm happily taken and to go fuck herself. \n\nYou are not the asshole dude. Not at all. These tests can understandably be done if the guy has TRULY done something to create distrust. You don't just get to put people on trial for no fucking reason, and the irony is that everyone who does this shit, in fact cheats themselves. I call it how I see it because that's what it was everytime.",

If you're that adamant about wanting her to leave and she doesn't leave after being asked, get a lawyer. That is assuming you want to take it to court. I assume from your wording however that you're just looking for a break. Though I could be wrong.\n\n Outside of that everyone sighting tenant laws could be slightly silly depending on the state you live in. Specifically because you own your house. You're not a tenant your its owner. I'm going to assume this for the moment based on you working 80-hour work weeks. You're literally working to people's Jobs worth of time. That's what most CEOs in Fortune 500 companies work. On top of that you're making her food? I'm going to assume then that you're probably not a CEO as it would be easier to simply buy her food she knows she likes. So either Blue Collar work or simple low level desk work. Which, if true, would logically imply that you have no time or energy left over to want to fight with this woman. As you said you \"just want peace\". All that being said I can easily understand why you feel the way you do and why you're wanting out. If only for a little while anyway.\n\n Anyway if I were you I would look at my cheap options first. Simple separation, one of you going to live with a friend or family member, couples therapy, or hell even just send her to therapy. If those aren't enough then I would look up owner and tenant laws for your state. Keep marriage in mind as if this leads to divorce in most places in the US you'll have to adhere to aforementioned gender slanted laws.\n\n Sorry you're going through this and sorry you're married to someone who doesn't appreciate that you work like a slave to keep a roof over their head and \"disgusting\" food in their stomach. I wish you all the best with your future child and happiness.",

If only for a little while anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway if I were you I would look at my cheap options first. Simple separation, one of you going to live with a friend or family member, couples therapy, or hell even just send her to therapy. If those aren&#39;t enough then I would look up owner and tenant laws for your state. Keep marriage in mind as if this leads to divorce in most places in the US you&#39;ll have to adhere to aforementioned gender slanted laws.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry you&#39;re going through this and sorry you&#39;re married to someone who doesn&#39;t appreciate that you work like a slave to keep a roof over their head and &quot;disgusting&quot; food in their stomach. I wish you all the best with your future child and happiness.</p>\n</div>",

The wife definitely deserves to be punished but isn't kicking her out a little too harsh? \n\nI guess my main question, how bad exactly is  the loyalty test? For me its not on the same level as cheating or physical abuse.  If I had to quantify the level of \"badness\" I'd say Cheating, Physical Abuse, and consistent emotional/verbal abuse is a 10/10. Whereas a one time loyalty test is a 7/10. 10/10 would qualify for kicking person out. I think a 7/10 requires therapy but not necessarily kicking the person out.",

        "body": "> some time apart might be helpful.\n\nYes, some time apart might be helpful. However,\n\n> I'm definitely not talking about divorce\n\n*You* might not be talking about divorce, but *she* will be thinking about it. Yes, she was an AH to you, that is not in question. However, she is currently pregnant and will interpret it as you leaving her while she is most vulnerable. \n\nFrom your original post, you describe how she doesn\u2019t like your cooking, but will eat it all anyway, which frustrates you. She is being honest when she says that she is hungry, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s eating it, regardless of if she *likes* it. She\u2019s growing a human inside of her, she\u2019s going to be hungry and *needs* to eat more food because of the energy expenditure. Remember: Everything she consumes and all of the stresses she undergoes while pregnant **will** effect your unborn child. If she doesn\u2019t eat, there will be ramifications due to lack of nutrients. Similarly, if she is kicked out of her home and forced to move, while already being emotionally distressed, you can *bet your ass* it will effect your child. And then to be invited to live with her husband who threw her out again while still being vulnerable, as if *he has to come save her*? Hell no she won\u2019t be coming back if she has an ounce of self-respect. That\u2019s a fucked-up power play you want to do to her. Never mess up, or you\u2019re out on your ass (disregarding context, because she will do so, not because it is the morally *right* way to react or internalize wrongdoings).\n\nNow, here\u2019s the thing: I *completely* understand why you are frustrated. She is being ungrateful towards your efforts with cooking, and then outright tests your commitment to her by setting up an undercover bust with her \u201cbest\u201d friend. That\u2019s fucked. But there are two separate things you are focusing on here, and you **need** to acknowledge that. \n\nThe food thing is a mild thing that can be addressed: Tell her that it hurts your feelings when she claims your food is disgusting, but leaves none for you to eat. She should know to apologize when she is being overly emotional and reactive. She should be granted slack if she apologizes for her behavior and tries to fix it. \n\nI\u2019ve left this out until now, but feel free to check my post history. My most recent post is from yesterday. I posted on r/babybumps because I am 4 months pregnant, and whenever I cook, the food comes out *wrong*. Everything else tastes great. That part is neither here nor there. However, when I posted that, I was having a complete breakdown because *I wanted tacos*! Moreover, I wanted *my* tacos, not my husband\u2019s, not Taco Bell. My. Tacos. And they came out *wrong*. I was absolutely distraught, and worse, an hour earlier, I yelled at my husband for trying to help me clean in the kitchen (hungry and being a jerk, see below). Then, I go into the kitchen to eat strawberries that I bought *yesterday*, and there was a lining of mold that couldn\u2019t be seen through the package. I couldn\u2019t eat anything I wanted and I was being a total dick to the one person who always cares about me. Instead of yelling at my husband (like I did a month ago before a similar ending happened), I took my happy ass to the grocery store and bought myself a bunch of different things that could potentially make me less angry and dickish. When I got home (and again before bed because I\u2019m anxious and get very guilty very easily), I apologized for how I had been behaving, and explained where my head was at. I acknowledged that being mad at him for helping me clean was wrong, and that I was being a jerk about dinner and strawberries.\n\nThe point of my story is that I have been working on controlling my emotions, or at least being honest and apologetic about the ones I can\u2019t seem to control. Being pregnant has made me ridiculously short-tempered (especially when I\u2019m hungry, something you might also want to consider that could be influencing her behavior), and I am insanely quick to cry and catastrophize. My husband, bless him, has gotten angry a few times, sometimes because of my emotions, other times because of his. However, what he has *never* done, and would *never* consider doing is kicking me out. Not before talking about it and explaining the stakes. Your wife **needs** to know that her behavior is pushing you away. \n\nYou also **need** to know that she is experiencing the most terrifying thing she can go through. We might live in a time where mother and infant mortality is low, but death during childbirth still happens, and in the US at *extraordinary* rates. Pregnancy is painful and miserable for some, and overall not horrible for others. Pregnancy is also considered to be one of the most traumatic experiences most women go through. She is coming from a place of fear \u2014 her entire body autonomy is *gone*. Regardless of if the pregnancy was planned and intentional, she still lost more body autonomy than she imagined. She can\u2019t eat what she wants, drink what she wants, or do what she wants. Logically, she can still eat *most* of what she wants, drink *most* of what she wants, and do *most* of what she wants, but everything she is exposed to tells her what she *can\u2019t* do. What she is doing that is hurting the unborn child. People are stopping her, telling her what he is doing wrong and why she is going to be awful. Did you know that pregnant women are allowed caffeine in small amounts? Not many people do. I\u2019ve had people *take my drink from out of my hands and throw it in the trash* because \u201ccaffeine will make you go into labor!\u201d Or \u201ccaffeine will stunt the babies growth!\u201d \n\nAnyways, the point of my rant here is that with the food, try to cut her *some* slack, while making sure she apologizes for things that she should be doing better (not telling you how awful your cooking is, and instead thanking you for your effort and help). Every time I\u2019ve had a weird freak out while pregnant, I apologize to my husband and tell him why I did what I did (so he can see my point-of-view, **not** to make him apologize or to scapegoat; I\u2019m acknowledging what I am doing and what led me to do it, so I can be better in the future). That has helped me freak out less, because I can see when I am reacting in a way that I have previously acknowledged as wrong. It has also helped me to notice the good things my husband does, and to appreciate his contributions. Finally, it makes it so that my next freak out isn\u2019t so basic; you go from freaking out about not having your favorite sushi anymore to freaking out because you can\u2019t stop the pain in your back. My freak outs become ones that are more normal and less extreme.\n\nFor the cheating set-up: This shit is far more serious. She should be acknowledging when she is acting overly emotional, as I said above, but there is no way that just acknowledging it will make you feel any better. You need to have a face-to-face discussion with her, and she needs to understand where she hurt you and why. Be prepared; she probably acted this way because she is insecure about herself now \u2014 she feels like an unlovable whale, and can\u2019t fathom you *not* cheating. Regardless, she should have never gone that far. She needs to know that she should have talked her feelings out with you, not formulated schemes with her \u201cbestie\u201d. You should stand your ground here, and explain why she fucked up.\n\nHowever, as I said earlier, if you kick your pregnant wife out, she will divorce you. If you really feel you need a break, **you need to be the one to take a break**. Like it or not, as husband and wife, you share everything. That is her house too. Kicking her out will remove any safety she feels in your relationship or even in that house. It will never be a home to her again, only a place housing the man who couldn\u2019t be bothered to see a therapist/tell the OBGYN about these increased symptoms. She will only see you as baby-daddy who kicked her to the curb when the going got rough.\n\nIf you\u2019re fine with divorce, then by all means, kick her out. But don\u2019t expect the divorce or the childcare to be easy. You\u2019ll have to go to court and set up schedules for who gets the kid when, and what of the things in \u201cyour house\u201d are actually hers. If you kick her out, she will have legal ground to sue you on, as you didn\u2019t abide by eviction laws (if you are in the US). And good luck getting custody when courts favor the mother, and you kicked the mother out to figure everything out for herself and the thing growing inside of her that just ruined her marriage. Like Jesus, kicking her out will ruin your relationship with her for the rest of your life. \n\nI know I could never trust my husband again if he did that to me. I\u2019d sure as shit never move back in with him. I\u2019d happily give him 50/50 custody because he\u2019s a great father-figure and I couldn\u2019t take his kid from him, but that\u2019s *me*. I don\u2019t know your wife, but you\u2019re giving her legal high ground.",

However, she is currently pregnant and will interpret it as you leaving her while she is most vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>From your original post, you describe how she doesn\u2019t like your cooking, but will eat it all anyway, which frustrates you. She is being honest when she says that she is hungry, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s eating it, regardless of if she <em>likes</em> it. She\u2019s growing a human inside of her, she\u2019s going to be hungry and <em>needs</em> to eat more food because of the energy expenditure. Remember: Everything she consumes and all of the stresses she undergoes while pregnant <strong>will</strong> effect your unborn child. If she doesn\u2019t eat, there will be ramifications due to lack of nutrients. Similarly, if she is kicked out of her home and forced to move, while already being emotionally distressed, you can <em>bet your ass</em> it will effect your child. And then to be invited to live with her husband who threw her out again while still being vulnerable, as if <em>he has to come save her</em>? Hell no she won\u2019t be coming back if she has an ounce of self-respect. That\u2019s a fucked-up power play you want to do to her. Never mess up, or you\u2019re out on your ass (disregarding context, because she will do so, not because it is the morally <em>right</em> way to react or internalize wrongdoings).</p>\n\n<p>Now, here\u2019s the thing: I <em>completely</em> understand why you are frustrated. She is being ungrateful towards your efforts with cooking, and then outright tests your commitment to her by setting up an undercover bust with her \u201cbest\u201d friend. That\u2019s fucked. But there are two separate things you are focusing on here, and you <strong>need</strong> to acknowledge that. </p>\n\n<p>The food thing is a mild thing that can be addressed: Tell her that it hurts your feelings when she claims your food is disgusting, but leaves none for you to eat. She should know to apologize when she is being overly emotional and reactive. She should be granted slack if she apologizes for her behavior and tries to fix it. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve left this out until now, but feel free to check my post history. My most recent post is from yesterday. I posted on <a href=\"/r/babybumps\">r/babybumps</a> because I am 4 months pregnant, and whenever I cook, the food comes out <em>wrong</em>. Everything else tastes great. That part is neither here nor there. However, when I posted that, I was having a complete breakdown because <em>I wanted tacos</em>! Moreover, I wanted <em>my</em> tacos, not my husband\u2019s, not Taco Bell. My. Tacos. And they came out <em>wrong</em>. I was absolutely distraught, and worse, an hour earlier, I yelled at my husband for trying to help me clean in the kitchen (hungry and being a jerk, see below). Then, I go into the kitchen to eat strawberries that I bought <em>yesterday</em>, and there was a lining of mold that couldn\u2019t be seen through the package. I couldn\u2019t eat anything I wanted and I was being a total dick to the one person who always cares about me. Instead of yelling at my husband (like I did a month ago before a similar ending happened), I took my happy ass to the grocery store and bought myself a bunch of different things that could potentially make me less angry and dickish. When I got home (and again before bed because I\u2019m anxious and get very guilty very easily), I apologized for how I had been behaving, and explained where my head was at. I acknowledged that being mad at him for helping me clean was wrong, and that I was being a jerk about dinner and strawberries.</p>\n\n<p>The point of my story is that I have been working on controlling my emotions, or at least being honest and apologetic about the ones I can\u2019t seem to control. Being pregnant has made me ridiculously short-tempered (especially when I\u2019m hungry, something you might also want to consider that could be influencing her behavior), and I am insanely quick to cry and catastrophize. My husband, bless him, has gotten angry a few times, sometimes because of my emotions, other times because of his. However, what he has <em>never</em> done, and would <em>never</em> consider doing is kicking me out. Not before talking about it and explaining the stakes. Your wife <strong>needs</strong> to know that her behavior is pushing you away. </p>\n\n<p>You also <strong>need</strong> to know that she is experiencing the most terrifying thing she can go through. We might live in a time where mother and infant mortality is low, but death during childbirth still happens, and in the US at <em>extraordinary</em> rates. Pregnancy is painful and miserable for some, and overall not horrible for others. Pregnancy is also considered to be one of the most traumatic experiences most women go through. She is coming from a place of fear \u2014 her entire body autonomy is <em>gone</em>. Regardless of if the pregnancy was planned and intentional, she still lost more body autonomy than she imagined. She can\u2019t eat what she wants, drink what she wants, or do what she wants. Logically, she can still eat <em>most</em> of what she wants, drink <em>most</em> of what she wants, and do <em>most</em> of what she wants, but everything she is exposed to tells her what she <em>can\u2019t</em> do. What she is doing that is hurting the unborn child. People are stopping her, telling her what he is doing wrong and why she is going to be awful. Did you know that pregnant women are allowed caffeine in small amounts? Not many people do. I\u2019ve had people <em>take my drink from out of my hands and throw it in the trash</em> because \u201ccaffeine will make you go into labor!\u201d Or \u201ccaffeine will stunt the babies growth!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the point of my rant here is that with the food, try to cut her <em>some</em> slack, while making sure she apologizes for things that she should be doing better (not telling you how awful your cooking is, and instead thanking you for your effort and help). Every time I\u2019ve had a weird freak out while pregnant, I apologize to my husband and tell him why I did what I did (so he can see my point-of-view, <strong>not</strong> to make him apologize or to scapegoat; I\u2019m acknowledging what I am doing and what led me to do it, so I can be better in the future). That has helped me freak out less, because I can see when I am reacting in a way that I have previously acknowledged as wrong. It has also helped me to notice the good things my husband does, and to appreciate his contributions. Finally, it makes it so that my next freak out isn\u2019t so basic; you go from freaking out about not having your favorite sushi anymore to freaking out because you can\u2019t stop the pain in your back. My freak outs become ones that are more normal and less extreme.</p>\n\n<p>For the cheating set-up: This shit is far more serious. She should be acknowledging when she is acting overly emotional, as I said above, but there is no way that just acknowledging it will make you feel any better. You need to have a face-to-face discussion with her, and she needs to understand where she hurt you and why. Be prepared; she probably acted this way because she is insecure about herself now \u2014 she feels like an unlovable whale, and can\u2019t fathom you <em>not</em> cheating. Regardless, she should have never gone that far. She needs to know that she should have talked her feelings out with you, not formulated schemes with her \u201cbestie\u201d. You should stand your ground here, and explain why she fucked up.</p>\n\n<p>However, as I said earlier, if you kick your pregnant wife out, she will divorce you. If you really feel you need a break, <strong>you need to be the one to take a break</strong>. Like it or not, as husband and wife, you share everything. That is her house too. Kicking her out will remove any safety she feels in your relationship or even in that house. It will never be a home to her again, only a place housing the man who couldn\u2019t be bothered to see a therapist/tell the OBGYN about these increased symptoms. She will only see you as baby-daddy who kicked her to the curb when the going got rough.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re fine with divorce, then by all means, kick her out. But don\u2019t expect the divorce or the childcare to be easy. You\u2019ll have to go to court and set up schedules for who gets the kid when, and what of the things in \u201cyour house\u201d are actually hers. If you kick her out, she will have legal ground to sue you on, as you didn\u2019t abide by eviction laws (if you are in the US). And good luck getting custody when courts favor the mother, and you kicked the mother out to figure everything out for herself and the thing growing inside of her that just ruined her marriage. Like Jesus, kicking her out will ruin your relationship with her for the rest of your life. </p>\n\n<p>I know I could never trust my husband again if he did that to me. I\u2019d sure as shit never move back in with him. I\u2019d happily give him 50/50 custody because he\u2019s a great father-figure and I couldn\u2019t take his kid from him, but that\u2019s <em>me</em>. I don\u2019t know your wife, but you\u2019re giving her legal high ground.</p>\n</div>",

They are real mental changes you can\u2019t control. It literally changes the brain and how it thinks. Bringing up hormones is just to make sure it factors into the equation. Was this person wonderful before being pregnant? Have they been pregnant before and acted similar? Nobody is saying OP is an asshole for feeling that way. Some of us just can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s a trial in the relationship that can be weathered and then fixed after the hormones are no longer a factor. It\u2019s not about excuses. It\u2019s about logistics and long term happiness. If the woman was a shitty person before too then the story is totally different. That\u2019s why it gets brought up. Nobody is invalidating the victim\u2019s feelings.\n\nMy mother has BPD. She\u2019s insufferable. I finally had to learn that she was a toxic influence in my life regardless of the reasons why. Understanding the reasons why only helped me to not harbor resentment for her. She can\u2019t help it. Doesn\u2019t mean I need to put up with it though and I had to almost completely cut her out of my life for many years because of it. Pregnancy hormones are thankfully not a permanent condition. That\u2019s why many people are asking if maybe this is something where OP can sit her down and tell her to get her shit together instead of going straight to kicking her out. That\u2019s all. People react differently too. One mother might only get cravings while another just despised the world around her for 9 months. It\u2019s up to OP what he\u2019s willing to tolerate obviously but he\u2019s here for perspective in the first place. I just wish people would stop bitching and moaning about how this sub gives pregnant women a free pass to be terrible people. That\u2019s such a gross misrepresentation. It\u2019s a total straw man argument to act like bringing up pregnancy hormones as a variable in the equation is the same as giving the woman a free pass to be a piece of shit.",

Because I never acted on the horrendous bullshit my hormones were working in my brain, because YOU KNOW when it's you, or some gross doppelganger thinking of brand new ways to fuck your shit up. \n\nOn the other hand I had a friend whose wife adopted some seriously destructive behavior during her pregnancy, her words were truly ruining their relationship, after some rough months and my friend threatening with divorce she gave in and they visited a therapist. Things really improved for them after that. \n\n \n\nExcusing your idiotic behavior with your hormones its exactly the same as when drunk people do stupid shit and say it was the alcohol acting, nah man, it's you who is making those choices.",

It's super easy for everyone on the internet to say \"leave her immediately.\" Being pregnant isn't an excuse, but it does make you irritable, insecure, and all kinds of emotional. \n\nI will tell you that the first year is super, super hard. I'm almost 6 months into the first year. If she was not like this pre-pregnancy, give a little grace. Get therapy started and help to work toward things being balanced. I'll also tell you that the hormones don't go away right when you have the baby. It can take months to feel in control of your emotions again. If you have the option, I'd try to cut down on the 80 hours a week. I know it's not plausible for a lot of people but constantly being at home with a baby is HARD WORK. Don't even get me started on if the baby has any issues (colic, reflux, milk allergy,etc) Sleep deprivation makes you irrational. Getting self care time for yourself and for your wife away from the baby is a must. Remember that it's a requirement to take care of yourself so that you can both be good parents.",

I've been on others that made me incredibly pleasant and I felt like I was seeing the world through rose colored glasses. After getting off of everything, depression I'd struggled with for years went away.
