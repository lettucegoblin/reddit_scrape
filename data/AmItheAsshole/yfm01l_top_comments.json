Now you know her true sentiments about you. If she was a true friend, the only thing that should have been coming out of her mouth is how grateful she is to have such an incredible friend do that for her during this chapter of her life. Instead, she highlighted the worst about what happened to you and used it as a basis of comparison as if she\u2019s better than you. Carol is the MVP here for bringing it up with you. 15 years of friendship and you have finally seen her true self. She probably has been doing this to you all along, just nothing egregious enough where you got wind of it.</p>\n</div>",

But the only \"snake\" in this situation is the woman who would take THOUSANDS of dollars from someone who thinks they are helping them live a cherished dream, and then go and talk shit about that person behind their fucking back!\n\nCarol showed honesty and integrity by showing you what Alyessa wrote to her. And far more empathy to you than Alyessa did.\n\nMaybe Alyessas words came from a place of fear. But if that is the case, than you own up to your fucking mistake and apologize for nuking your friendship when you fuck up. Not downplay it as a \"joke\" between \"desperate infertile women\". Jesus Herbert Fucking Christ. \n\nMy endometriosis has made me infertile. Trying to get pregnant was literally killing me, because I was bleeding so much from my unregulated periods after going off of BC. Clomid did nothing for me, and after being on it for 6 months, I never ovulated once. Having to choose my life and wellbeing over the dream of being a mom wrecked me. But I'm lucky. My husband loved me through my grief, and we are in a place now where we, and most importantly I, am OK with being child free. The grief still lingers, but hubby helps me through it. \n\nOP, you are not broken. You are not unlovable. You will find someone who cherishes you for the amazing person you are, for the joy and light and love you have to offer to the world. You will find others, like Carol, who respect you too much to let such gross insults to you go by without repercussions. It was not Carol's place to punish Alyessa, but it was her place as your friend to give you the full story of just how ungrateful Alyessa is and to let you deal with her from there. \n\nIt is better to be alone, and be in sincere company with yourself, than to surround yourself with vipers, and end up alone in a crowd who will watch with bated breath to see you suffer in front of them. \n\nBut you are not alone. You have my love, and the care of others like us. You have Carol. And you have an internal strength that you are just barely learning to harness. Blessed be sister.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well said! And OP...  Carol KNOWS how she meant it. That&#39;s why she is digging in her heels. If it was harmless, she would have kept it to herself and wouldn&#39;t  be doubling down. &quot;When you are wrong, you apologize instead of argue&quot; is a lesson for L and her husband... I hope beyond hope one of y&#39;alls &quot;friends&quot; sends them this thread, and we can tell them what you are too polite to. L AND HUSBAND ARE TOO EMOTIONALLY STUNTED AND OBSESSED WITH OBTAINING A CHILD TO BE PRESENT, GIVING PARENTS. Everything else aside, you have now been show that your loan/gift is inappropriate, as funding a child for self centered narcissistic assholes isn&#39;t a wise move. They are harrowing your heart and harassing you for money. A restraining order should be mentioned if requests escalate or continue endlessly. NTA.</p>\n\n<p>And OP... My heart goes to you, a woman who so values motherhood and the growth of a little one to share hope with another and want to help that spark of joy into the world, without being possessive of it. You would have, and could still make a wonderful parent. You are an amazing person. Stand strong on the backs of the good people of Reddit.... we got you!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Let things settle down a while, then earmark a portion of that $1 for a lovely gift,  extraordinary meal or nice weekend away for or with your kind friend Carol. Rewarding her integrity could bring you some closure on this nonsense, and remind your &quot;friend&quot; group that karma does not work in mysterious ways.</p>\n</div>",
