So much so that I already have 2 different cousins hooked on these cameras who set them up around the house, one is a cop so he just likes the security and the other is a father of a toddler so its always nice to have some peace of mind.\n\nThe cameras are sold at Home Depot for $35 each and come with a 16gb Micro SD card. You can buy them without the SD card on amazon for like $25. If you do not have an SD card, the camera records I believe 15 seconds of motion every time it is detected and stores it in a cloud for either 1 or 2 weeks. This is nice if no one is home, so if there is motion you can determine easiky what it was. But once it detects motion and records the clip, I think it wont record again for 30min or 1hr.\n\nIf you put in an SD card, it is always recording and you can view the footage on the app. This is best all the time as sometimes you need more than 15 seconds of footage to see what caused motion. The app also alerts you when it detects motion so you dont have to sift thru hours of video to find something interesting.\n\nPlus the cameras have amazing night vision, but the audio recording is like 4/10. The camera just plugs in to a wall outlet so no special wiring. The stand is magnetic so you can mount it on the side of anything, even non magnetic stuff as it comes with a sticky metal plate to mount anywhere if you wish. Plus the best part is there is no monthly fee, there isnt even an option for one. You just buy a 32 or 64gb SD card and that is plenty to record for a long time. It is super easy to set up, just download the app on your phone, set up a free account, plug in your camera, and scan the QR code off your phone screen with your camera. Instantly connected to wifi and ready to view footage. I would say it takes 3 minutes to set this camera up, and most of that time would be spent downloading the app and unboxing the camera.\n\nFor anyone that wants a cheap camera that is extremely easy to set up, I do not think there is a better product out there than Wyze. I mean fuck, if they made the camera housing aluminum and improved audio quality, i bet it would have no trouble selling for even 4x the cost.",
