My husband sometimes calls Carl his \"nicotine\" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. \n\nWe planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after mg husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.\n\nMy husband said we should just share one room snd I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would takethe bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him i didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull \"Carl is a widower\" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to gonhome. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.\n\nThey got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Carl should have slept on the floor (did this hotel not have rollaways?)\n\nI'm thinking that given how she described that Carl did not have the money to pay for a room and they did not have the money to pay for a room for him, that they likely booked the room for only two people, her and her husband.

I was going for hyperbole but it was 5. 5 incredibly camp but not ready to come out guys. </p>\n\n<p>One very closeted gay friend kissed me and I was momentarily confused, I quite liked him, maybe he wasn&#39;t gay but then he came up for air he said &quot;Oh, I knew it would work with you&quot;. End of my confusion. </p>\n\n<p>It got so that if one of the &quot;all my friends are girls I just get on better with them&quot; guys went in for a drunken kiss I used to say, &quot;I mean we could, but it won&#39;t make the obvious go away, it&#39;ll just delay it, so let&#39;s not&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And then I had a teary drunk gay friend crying on my shoulder for the rest of the night. Fun times.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I thought I would marry someone that did come out to me. We never dated properly, but everyone thought we were, and he sure happily lead me along for nearly a decade with nothing intimate, but plenty of flirtations and small things that made me think there was something there. The gaslighting and other emotional manipulation sure did a number on me too. \n\nI may have been the only person they were entirely out to; no clue. I couldn't shake my feelings for them even though they were secretly starting to see a few men, and I may have been the only one who knew about these relationships as I was this person's best friend for those years and I know he wasn\u2019t out to his parent or our larger group of mutual friends. \n\nEventually, it got way too emotionally manipulative in ways that didn't involve his sexuality, and I ultimately got out of that friendship. I guess I wasn't vulnerable enough or the one he was willing to fake it with. When we did date for a whopping 3 months, he was *ashamed* and *embarrassed* to be seen with me in public. Not just around friends, anywhere. Wouldn't even hold my hand in a dark movie theatre and chewed me out for wanting to. When he dumped me, he went back to the flirtations and whatnot previously.\n\nWhen our friendship was on the cusp of falling apart, he met a very recent (around three months) widow who had lost her husband. He asked me how I felt about him starting to see her. I was hurt as I foolishly still had feelings for him and internally questioned why *not* me, confused as he is gay, and concerned for her as I doubt he told her, knew I wouldn't tell her, or she didn't care as there is a religious aspect to their relationship that deals with \"saving\" or \"hiding\" from God. \n\nI saw it as him preying on a very vulnerable person and using them as a cover for their sexuality and faith which is what I said to him. Didn't get much of a reaction out of him and didn't expect one. He's a charming guy, reasonably attractive, everyone likes him, and many people of both sexes wanted to be with him. Anyway, they got married maybe a year after they met. I still have no clue if she knows, they have four children together, and I can only imagine what will happen if/when he wakes up one day tired of living a lie. I am *glad* this was not my fate. \n\nTo try and answer your *why me,* from my experience, I genuinely feel anyone who does this is taking an opportunity for them to hide. It's selfish and sad behaviour borne out of a global society that is not yet fully accepting of gay people. Some places are better than others, but even in North America, where it is arguably better for gay folks than most places, people still stay in the closet. People who feel like they must hurt others by lying or manipulating to protect themselves. I don't condone it, but I get it to a degree. \n\nAs difficult as this time is for you, take heart in knowing you made the right choice for you and that you can only have better days from here forward. Understand that it wasn't really about you if that makes sense. You were the collateral damage in someone's selfish attempt to hide from themselves, no matter how much they loved you because they don't like who they are at the core. It\u2019s sad, and all I feel for my former friend now is pity.",

The gaslighting and other emotional manipulation sure did a number on me too. </p>\n\n<p>I may have been the only person they were entirely out to; no clue. I couldn&#39;t shake my feelings for them even though they were secretly starting to see a few men, and I may have been the only one who knew about these relationships as I was this person&#39;s best friend for those years and I know he wasn\u2019t out to his parent or our larger group of mutual friends. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, it got way too emotionally manipulative in ways that didn&#39;t involve his sexuality, and I ultimately got out of that friendship. I guess I wasn&#39;t vulnerable enough or the one he was willing to fake it with. When we did date for a whopping 3 months, he was <em>ashamed</em> and <em>embarrassed</em> to be seen with me in public. Not just around friends, anywhere. Wouldn&#39;t even hold my hand in a dark movie theatre and chewed me out for wanting to. When he dumped me, he went back to the flirtations and whatnot previously.</p>\n\n<p>When our friendship was on the cusp of falling apart, he met a very recent (around three months) widow who had lost her husband. He asked me how I felt about him starting to see her. I was hurt as I foolishly still had feelings for him and internally questioned why <em>not</em> me, confused as he is gay, and concerned for her as I doubt he told her, knew I wouldn&#39;t tell her, or she didn&#39;t care as there is a religious aspect to their relationship that deals with &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;hiding&quot; from God. </p>\n\n<p>I saw it as him preying on a very vulnerable person and using them as a cover for their sexuality and faith which is what I said to him. Didn&#39;t get much of a reaction out of him and didn&#39;t expect one. He&#39;s a charming guy, reasonably attractive, everyone likes him, and many people of both sexes wanted to be with him. Anyway, they got married maybe a year after they met. I still have no clue if she knows, they have four children together, and I can only imagine what will happen if/when he wakes up one day tired of living a lie. I am <em>glad</em> this was not my fate. </p>\n\n<p>To try and answer your <em>why me,</em> from my experience, I genuinely feel anyone who does this is taking an opportunity for them to hide. It&#39;s selfish and sad behaviour borne out of a global society that is not yet fully accepting of gay people. Some places are better than others, but even in North America, where it is arguably better for gay folks than most places, people still stay in the closet. People who feel like they must hurt others by lying or manipulating to protect themselves. I don&#39;t condone it, but I get it to a degree. </p>\n\n<p>As difficult as this time is for you, take heart in knowing you made the right choice for you and that you can only have better days from here forward. Understand that it wasn&#39;t really about you if that makes sense. You were the collateral damage in someone&#39;s selfish attempt to hide from themselves, no matter how much they loved you because they don&#39;t like who they are at the core. It\u2019s sad, and all I feel for my former friend now is pity.</p>\n</div>",
