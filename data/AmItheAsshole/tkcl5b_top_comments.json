Op put a huge amount of money, time, and love into cultivating these plants. Niece had helped OP care for these plants many times and is old enough to realize that what she did was theft and destruction of property. SIL is the biggest AH in this no doubt. She saw dollar signs as soon as OP asked her and her daughter to plant sit and realized she could make some quick money. Niece could have texted OP or called and asked for permission to trim plants and take cuttings. She never did because she also KNEW what they were doing was wrong. I think the screaming at a teenager until she cried was too far but I can see how absolutely furious she was and for good reason.</p>\n</div>",

I am so sorry you lost a lot of prized possessions that way - and they absolutely sounds like they did it maliciously. You said you&#39;d give &quot;some cuttings&quot; - you didn&#39;t give them permission to do the damage they did. I&#39;m sure you also meant some cuttings by your hand - not theirs. They took those plants and sold it - didn&#39;t even try and keep it for Jenny. I&#39;d definitely agree with cutting them out and going N/C - family also means not abusing privileges.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: also, def take them to small claims court and tell them they owe you every cent from selling those beauties. If they don&#39;t, proceed with legalities if possible where you are</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s not so much about them making money off my work as...the disrespect. I love growing plants and want to share that with other people. They want to turn my plants into profit. If it were about the money, I&#39;d charge for them myself. I don&#39;t know how to put it in words, exactly, but it sucks when you&#39;re doing something out of...love, not for the people, but the plants...and all someone else sees is dollar signs. I wouldn&#39;t even be so offended if they planted those starts and then sold the fruit! Or something they made out of the fruit! But turning my kind gesture into a money-making opportunity stinks!</p>\n</div>",
