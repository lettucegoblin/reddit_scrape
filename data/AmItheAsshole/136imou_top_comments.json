My wife needed to take our son to an appt nd I needed to WFH today so my MIL came to watch after our daughter.\n\nMy daughter needed to use the bathroom, and I was going to excuse myself from my online meeting but my MIL said she had it. A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.\n\nI said to her, \"You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?\" \n\nShe told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out. She did leave, and about ten minutes layer my wife called me and said her mom was furious with me and said I was terrible to her and made her leave without any reason. After explaining, my wife is on my side. \n\nAITA for defending my daughter's \"real\" vagina?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now your rear is a little raised and from the angle plus the seat under you your cheeks are a little \u201cspread\u201d. Not like super wide but at least for me they\u2019re apart. \n\nNow wipe from the taint across the booty hole. You maybe need two swipes but usually I only need one. Sit up and with a fresh piece of tp, reach between your thighs and wipe your vulva front to back as well. \n\nYou should be pretty clean. I like to use a gentle TP spray (it\u2019s water, a bit of witch hazel and aloe gel, homemade) after a bm in public because I\u2019m kinda weird but you should be fine without. \n\nIf you wanna use only one piece of tp, you can wipe the vulva first, then use the paper on your booty. My cousin does it that way (she taught me this method, we both were not taught properly as kids) but for me the idea of wipe urine on my butt is kinda sketch. I dunno why. \n\nI think if I could do it all in one swipe it wouldn\u2019t bother me but needing to change positions makes it kinda gross to use a damp piece. But if it works for you I do not judge.\n\nETA: first of all thanks for rewards, second I have NO idea why I said I use TP spray in **public** because I use it any time I think I need it, public or private. I\u2019m not gonna change it though because it\u2019s been there and commented on. And I think changing it and making other comments look foolish would be mean.",

I wipe my vulva front to back. I might carry through to wipe my taint if it feels relevant. Usually I have not taken very much paper for this, so I just let it fall into the toilet.</p>\n\n<p>I take new paper for my rear. I use my left hand for this, partly so I still have a more clean right hand in case I want to wipe my vulva again.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I comfortably twist and arch my back for better reach, and wipe up (front to back) from my taint (perineum). I personally take enough paper for this to fold and use again. I wipe until there&#39;s no poo left.</p>\n\n<p>I saw something above about damp toilet paper. It can be easier for me to wipe my rear with toilet paper damp from urine or water. I wipe away the dampness afterward with dry paper.</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add: the amount of paper that gets you clean is the right amount of paper.</p>\n</div>",
