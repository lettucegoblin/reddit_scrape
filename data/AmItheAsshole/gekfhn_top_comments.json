These are public records that (depending on the state) can be downloaded online or can be copied for a minimal fee at any courthouse in that jurisdiction.\n\n4.)Basically, you need a copy of your grandmother's will/trust/testamentary documents ASAP.  Immediately.\n\n5.)If, after analyzing the terms of the trust and/or will (or other testamentary vehicle), you determine your parents have stolen your money, you have some big decisions to make.  You can initiate a beneficiary clawback action against your sister AND a trustee/executor-misconduct action against your parent(s) -- the latter is the prime mechanism for getting the money back.

Get what compensation you can so that you have more financial leeway as you move forward.</p>\n\n<p>Healing meaning, you will need to process this incredible betrayal (sounds dramatic, but thats what it is).  Therapy may be in order.  And I won&#39;t tell you what healing will look like for you, but as you come first, that includes your emotional well being. Something your parents did not give a fck about.\nBuild new boundries, create a support system with people who value you as much as you value them.  </p>\n\n<p>Please continue to update when you can.  But if you are unable to, thats alright.  Because from now on OP, you come first.</p>\n</div>",

Or would they give you a \u201cyou knew the consequences, especially after your sister, you made your bed now lie in it alone\u201d attitude? It seems they just automatically expect you to be more mature and reasonable. \n\nYou are the only person in your home who seems to understand that actions have consequences, so unfortunately it\u2019s up to you to teach them what that means. Your sister clearly doesn\u2019t understand (and why would she? Your parents taught her she could do whatever and their threats would fall flat and she\u2019d still get what she wants) and your parents are under the insane impression that they can take a college fund from one kid to give to the other, and there won\u2019t be any consequences for them. That\u2019s crazy absurd that they thought they could do that, hide it from you, and then blame you for being upset when you inevitably find out?

In my view, if one of the points was that you can\u2019t have the money if you got pregnant, then it seems to me that you or at least you and your cousins are entitled to your sister\u2019s share.

They didn't even have much to give him for college but every penny they put away in his name was going to be his to start a life in the future. My mom used her money (only about a thousand dollars) to take care of me, before going to college, working as much as she could, and my grandparents had to make sacrifices for me. A lot of stuff for me was gifts from other people or hand-me-downs, and from the sounds of it I was a lot sicker and my mom in much worse shape than you nephew and sister so I don't think \"medical expenses\" is an excuse either. \n\nYou can absolutely help take care of a grandchild from a teenage pregnancy without stealing 70-100k+ dollars from one of your siblings. End of discussion. And if she spent all of her own college fund up on her child? That means she doesn't get to college to be a pixar animator. She gets to get a job and work through college and take out loans to do so like hundreds over other people all over the country have to. \n\nWhen she found out they did this to you she should have been screaming mad and told you so you would know until you know, right at the time youre supposed to be picking out colleges to fucking go to. But she didn't, because she thinks she, and by extension her child, deserve it more than you. There is a middle ground between \"accepting being homeless\" and \"100k dollars belonging to your sister also being used for your own personal education and child and car\". She doesn't care. As far as she is concerned you deserve the debt, but not HER. \n\nYour family needs to do several things before you even consider letting them back into your life: 1. tell the whole family what they did 2. agree to take out loans on your behalf 3. tell you personally why they thought it was okay to personally fuck you over while other family members are present and why they felt you somehow deserved student loans to shoulder the burden for your sister and nephew, and 4. your sister can fucking pay you back for the car. I don't care if she needs to take out another loan or cant move out as fast, when you accept stolen money to buy your sorry ass a car, you should refuse. She didn't. She may not have know about the college, but she knew about the car. Therefore, she owes you money for the car back. She can at least take fucking responsibility for that. \n\nAnd even THEN you would be fully in the right to never want to speak to them again. I cannot fucking believe their behavior. JFC. I cannot fathom how heartless they would have to be to do this. I would never, ever believe they loved me ever again if they did this to me.",
