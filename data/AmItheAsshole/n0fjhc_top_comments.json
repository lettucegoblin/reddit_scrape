I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.</p>\n</div>",

Your husband can of course have a relationship with his mother and family but you and your child never have to be in her presence. Can you even see about getting a restraining order against her after what she did at the funeral? She is a monster and when your child is older she will do everything to twist things against you and fill their head with how you treated her or lies about your baby\u2019s passing.

This is 100% your decision but you should put major consideration into your husband\u2019s feelings.  </p>\n\n<p>After the child is born perhaps you can do a trial period where you meet your MIL in public places (infrequently and only when you feel that your mental health is strong enough to survive another hateful scene should it arise) so that she can meet and spend time with your child.  If her behavior and attitude truly changes, you can start to give her a little more length to her leash.</p>\n\n<p>I won\u2019t judge you if you don\u2019t take this course of action but it may show your husband that you\u2019re willing to dip your toes in the muddy waters that your mother in law created because it\u2019s important to him.</p>\n</div>",

Your MIL's actions have made her entirely unredeemable.\n\nGrieving people can do some messed up stuff that is completely out of character. Some of those things may be forgivable. Verbally abusing a mother at her child's funeral is not one of those things.\n\nYour husband's family is vile. Instead of supporting the people who just lost their CHILD (the people the most deeply affected by this horrific tragedy that nobody should have to endure), they jumped on the bandwagon to call you selfish for not acknowledging their pain as equal to yours. Losing any loved one is an awful, painful thing. Losing your child is the worst pain I can imagine surviving. Anyone not you or your husband who attempts to equate their own pain and grief with yours at the loss of YOUR child is a disgusting human, and quite simply wrong.\n\nYour MIL never showed the slightest interest in \"apologizing\" until she found out about your pregnancy... Read that again. Your MIL is only interested in \"apologizing\" and \"moving past this\" because she wants access to your kid, not because she believes she was actually wrong in her past behavior.\n\nYour MIL's actions are not the actions of someone who is horrified at their own past behavior and truly remorseful.  If she were truly remorseful, she would reach out privately, own her actions without any excuses, give you the space to decide whether or not you could ever forgive her enough to have her in your life in any capacity, and accept that you are not obligated to forgive her or allow her in your life ever again. She is doing none of this.\n\nYour MIL is attempting to orchestrate a situation where you cannot win. Her \"apology\" dinner is self-serving and performative. She wants to be SEEN as being apologetic, without any true remorse. Putting her \"apology\" out in public view is a calculated tactic to attempt make you look like the bad guy for not accepting her demand.\n\nTrue remorse accepts that our actions have consequences, and respects the needs and feelings of the person we have wronged over our own desires. A reasonable consequence to her monstrous actions is to never be allowed contact to you or any children you may have.  MIL has no interest in taking responsibility for her behavior and the immeasurable pain she caused you. She only wants to be SEEN \"apologizing\" so you \"move past it\" and allow her access to your child.  \n\nThe person who caused harm does not get to dictate when or if they are forgiven. They do not get to dictate a timeline on how long the aggrieved party is hurt. Everyone who is pushing for you to \"move past this\" and \"forgive\" is the worst kind of wrong.\n\nYou could even prove that MIL is only interested in access to your child.  The next time a member of your husband's family tries to push the issue, tell them that you will entertain the possibility of allowing MIL to have her apology dinner in 5-10 years, if she can respect your need for space to heal and does not attempt to contact you, or have anyone else contact you on her behalf during that time.  After all, if MIL is sooooooooo sorry for the hurt she caused, then she should be more than willing to do ANYTHING to fix it.\n\nSpoiler: everyone will lose their minds.\n\nShe wants you to \"get over it\" on her timeline so she gets to be grandma.\n\nEven if MIL had never behaved monstrously toward you at your son's funeral and thereafter, she still stomped your boundaries and questioned your every choice for your son when he was living. Is that really the type of person that you and your husband would want in your lives as you are preparing to bring another child into this world?\n\nYou and your husband owe MIL nothing. She is not owed (nor does she deserve) to be in your lives or the lives of your children.  Full stop.\n\nMy heart aches for you in ways that are hard to quantify... I know your husband is conflicted because nothing about this situation is easy. I think you should show him this thread and have an honest discussion about your feelings... Particularly, I think it's important to discuss why your MIL's desire to have access to your child carries more weight than your need to remain no-contact with someone who publicly abused you during the most excruciatingly painful time of your life.\n\nI'm so sorry for everything you've been through.

First, you need to talk to your husband about MILs previous treatment of you, her outburst at the funeral, and how this treatment will continue the moment you accept her for show \"apology\". point out to him that she only felt a need to apologize the moment she heard about your pregnancy and saw something she could gain out of a relationship with you, hopefully, he will see it as well if he's already gone no contact for a while. say it as it is and warn him that this family dinner is a trap, the money she's offering will be held over your head later no matter how small the amount, this should be evident in her past actions that she will use that leverage to control your parenting as much as you let her. Remind him of her actions while your son was in the hospital, that all she cared about was picking fights and battling for power over what happened to YOUR son. you and your husbands' feelings don't mean shit to her and that may be hard to show your husband because well, it's his mom which is why I recommend a controlled environment like couples counseling to make sure he listens to your entire point and sees your perspective. knowing how she blew up at the funeral she will most likely use the passing of your son as leverage against you as well, this apology is 100% bullshit and so she most likely feels every word she told you, passive aggressively bringing it up when she wants to take control of your parenting and undermine your decisions will probably become a common occurrence when she's allowed to contact you again. my \"grandmother\" was a lot like this woman and your husband needs to understand that his mom would not AT ALL be a positive influence on your child. she will try to manipulate them to believe what she wants, will try to turn your own kid against you and will overall make parenting harder for the both of you. I recommend you convince your husband to reject the invitation and talk to him about everything as soon as possible, reason with him that the child would really benefit from no contact with MIL. if the family makes a stink about it ask if they would really forgive the person who made a scene at their child's funeral and to respect your wishes this once because while you still had contact with her, MIL never did. Mention to them that none of your relationship with her was really positive or healthy aside from the funeral incident she was just awful to you and you don't wish to further build a relationship like that especially when you're getting ready to deal with being a mom. You deserve better OP, and so does your child, it'll be hard for your husband at first cuz his side of the family will be upset with him but you need to try and convince him that its all for the better, because it is.

She tried to dictate your journey as a mother and is attempting to do the same again. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not going to harp on your husband, he\u2019s going through his own grief process and he did cut contact, so he is supportive. However, he seems to carry the family trait of taking the easier road of moving on without completing the hard work needed to do so in a healthy way. So this is really two separate issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You and hubby need therapy and time. Both of you need to be ready to move on, not just one. It sounds as if he understands, but is willing to relent due to weakness from grief. Hold your ground.</li>\n<li>Forgiveness means nothing without internal peace. You do not have peace with this woman. Tell them you aren\u2019t there yet, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be, but you\u2019ll reach out when you are and if you want to.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Everyone has an opinion on someone else\u2019s pain but no one is out there with you shootin in the gym or puttin money towards therapy. These other opinions, mine included, don\u2019t matter. However, you\u2019re NTA here, I can assure you. I grieve with you for your loss and rejoice with you on your new addition. I pray health and blessings and wish you peace and happiness \ud83e\udd70</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019ve yet to carry a child past 1st trimester and at my age, the likelihood of ever holding my own child in my arms is a fading dream. \n\nAs the stepmother of two older teenage boys with a narcissist biological mother, I anguish for them every time they interact with her. I\u2019ve picked them up from visits with her of them sobbing on the ride back to our home, but they have this sense of duty to her - as she has dictated to them. We have told them both that they are at the age where they can make the decision of where they will be, and they need to do what is best for them. This is the limit of what we can do without being accused of parental alienation. I\u2019m not sure how honest we will be with them once they are both adults, but we have urged them both to discuss their concerns in therapy - which they reject. We also are quick to point out when they are dating individuals with similar behaviors that those people are not who you want in their life. The older one is starting to make connections. \nThis will be a lifelong struggle for OP\u2019s husband. While I understand everyone feeling like she needs to issue ultimatums to him regarding this, it isn\u2019t that easy for him. He will absolutely feel the pull to return to his family because his formative years were normal to him. It is not going to be easy for him to reject their invitations out of hand. I hope though that OP can show him this thread so that he can see how disturbing his mother\u2019s wishes are to so many outsiders. Neither of you need to subject yourself to the conversation MIL wants to have. \nThat conversation is truly all about her, and it being so public will lend to both of you being the bad guy if you put any limitations on her access to your child. \nAll behavior has consequences. Her behaviors not only at the funeral but also during your child\u2019s care are unforgivable, and your reactions and continued feelings are incredibly valid and just. \nStay strong, and all my best wishes and prayers for a healthy pregnancy, delivery and child.  \n\n100% NTA",

I would never see or speak to this woman again and I certainly would not allow my child anywhere near her. What she said is unforgivable in my book. She is the worst of the worst, and the things she said cannot be unsaid. She has had time to apologise and she only wants to do so when she hears the news of a new child, if she wants to apologise to you, why hasn't she done so, why is she making a big song and dance over it, instead of just calling you and apologising? She wants everyone to feel bad for her that is why, she wants to have a big party and apologise and make you feel forced to accept. I would find it hard to be forgiving of anyone who said I should forgive her including your husband. You might get people saying oh she is your family but that just means she should be held to a higher standard, what she said isn't something that you just throw out into without consequences. Please look after yourself, don't allow anyone to pressure you into seeing, speaking too or accepting an apology from this woman. You and your baby don't need the stress. Perhaps talk to your doctor about this. I think honestly you need to have a conversation with your husband and lay it out for him that you and your child will never have a relationship with his mother and you don't want to hear anything about it from anyone ever again. If he can't accept that then I suggest couples counselling, grief counselling and if he won't maybe simply asking for space from this topic or just space from him in general, you and your baby need to come first, you need a partner and right now he isn't putting your needs first. I would also advise talking to a legal professional to discuss grandparents rights and conditions of a custody agreement that prevents her from seeing  your child that might put you more at ease. Your family should be making sure you enjoy the pregnancy, that you can relax as much as possible. If your inlaws cannot do that then perhaps it is time to reevaluate those individual relationships too. Congratulations and I hope you can enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.",

I didn't actually forgive him, as I was still in pretty big denial over the whole situation (after about a year or two, got stuck in anger for a good 15 years, and just recently hit the sadness phase).

        "body": "You hit the nail on the head. Narcissist parents view their children as extensions of themselves and any attempt at making a life separate from their parents and the parents wishes is seen as an act of defiance.\n\nThe reverse Oedipus complex you're talking about is called Jocasta complex and that's exactly what the Nmom is trying to do. As sick as it is, in the MIL's mind, OP's husband is cheating on her with OP. See emotional incest. This is where no physical sexual contact occurs but normal, healthy boundaries in a parent/child relationship are crossed.\n\n MIL is likely using her son as a surrogate spouse and son is fulfilling the emotional needs of the MIL that a SO should. This is even more likely if MIL is divorced from son's father or widowed. I know this because I experienced it for myself with my ex and his mother. She never tried to hide the fact that she hated me simply because we were together. It was obvious that she viewed me as the other woman and therefore competition. \n\nI studied all this after I left him because he refused to separate himself from her. More so couldn't because she wouldn't allow him to. She refused to accept that he was an adult free to make his own choices. When I figured out what was wrong with her, all her past behavior made a lot of sense. \n\nVictims of childhood abuse see the behavior as normal because it's all they know and even if they see that it's unhealthy and abnormal, it can take years to separate from their parent(s) because the child is taught and in a way gaslighted into doing what the parents want because they're taught that anything other than abiding by their wishes is disrespect. To make matters worse, often in toxic families, the family members are taught that loyalty to family, even above spouses is paramount and that anything else is unacceptable. In toxic families, everyone often has a role and this carries over into adulthood.\n\nSorry for rambling but I hope this helped explain what happens in families with narcissistic parents. I'm no Dr but I've studied this enough to understand that that's exactly what's happening in this scenario.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You hit the nail on the head. Narcissist parents view their children as extensions of themselves and any attempt at making a life separate from their parents and the parents wishes is seen as an act of defiance.</p>\n\n<p>The reverse Oedipus complex you&#39;re talking about is called Jocasta complex and that&#39;s exactly what the Nmom is trying to do. As sick as it is, in the MIL&#39;s mind, OP&#39;s husband is cheating on her with OP. See emotional incest. This is where no physical sexual contact occurs but normal, healthy boundaries in a parent/child relationship are crossed.</p>\n\n<p>MIL is likely using her son as a surrogate spouse and son is fulfilling the emotional needs of the MIL that a SO should. This is even more likely if MIL is divorced from son&#39;s father or widowed. I know this because I experienced it for myself with my ex and his mother. She never tried to hide the fact that she hated me simply because we were together. It was obvious that she viewed me as the other woman and therefore competition. </p>\n\n<p>I studied all this after I left him because he refused to separate himself from her.
