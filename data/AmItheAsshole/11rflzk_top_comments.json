You went to your supervisor and had an honest conversation about it, which was <em>necessary</em>. She made a call, one I fully agree with, and took the best action that would <em>let their supervisors decide the appropriate response</em>...which tells us all that their supervisors <em>did not approve</em> of their behavior. </p>\n\n<p>You did the right thing. Your supervisor did the right thing. They were <em>harassing</em> you and doing something called <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/03/we-need-to-retire-the-term-microaggressions\">microaggressions</a>, aka subtle acts of exclusion, which is typically seen for POC, but I think it also fits here (I linked an article that talks mainly about how the effects on POC are cumulative and think it might help you put the whole thing in perspective). I would have encouraged the same things as your supervisor and I think their supervisors did what they thought was right and appropriate for the situation.</p>\n\n<p>If C didn&#39;t want to lose out on his scholarship, he should have behaved appropriately for the department. Your friend is wrong. Those boys are wrong, and this wasn&#39;t a &quot;silly joke&quot; but very inappropriate for the program you&#39;re in, the larger world of business, and just public behavior in general. Good people don&#39;t need to put down other people.</p>\n</div>",

Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum, and choose to hang out with other people.\n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out four). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\". \n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I dont have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their \u201csilly joke\u201c. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It\u2019s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that. \n\nI now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship.

I knew her fairly well and she talked about just how difficult it was as a female scientist since the field was unbelievably sexist. She said several times that she would\u2019ve majored in another field had she known.</p>\n</div>",

I had done nothing to provoke her and we actually got along quite well in the beginning, she wasn't a cook but as time went on she insisted she be in the kitchen. Even though the restaurant was predominantly female, all the other cooks were male and I got along with all of them. She kept using her connection to the shift manager to push me out of the kitchen, made remarks ect., she even belittled me for how I was training my first-time trainee, took over and loudly complained about my inability to do so.\n\nOne day she insisted she be in the kitchen and share it with one of our coworkers who'd never been in the kitchen before, the only things she knew were the handful of things I had shown her on slow days. Praising her loudly, announcing how much better she was, all that. The kitchen was actually super behind, we were holding on a lot of orders. The other cook wanted to do dishes so the manager switched me and the other girl but the older coworker did not like that. She ended up trapping me in the walk in when I went to get more product to discuss my \"attitude\", although she wouldn't let me speak and just berated me the whole time. People came to get us out but she'd yell at them, we were in there so long we were holding on everything and she *still* didn't want to let me out until finally her aunt in law came and yelled at us. She then later tried to trap me in the parking lot but my friend was able to help me out of that\n\nI didn't report her because I knew potentially losing her job could directly impact her fight for full custody over her daughter, but the dishwasher did. She was reprimanded by the assistant general manager and even though she didn't lose her job, both she and her aunt were later fired by our boss after I quit. I'm super thankful to him as well. He was also one of the few people who tried to protect his girlfriend and I from the sexual harassment we were receiving from the rehired dishwasher. Everyone else found it funny or just said it was \"M being M\". Loved that guy he was ready to fight",
