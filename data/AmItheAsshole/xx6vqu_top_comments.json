Seriously, I need to go hug my kids because I wish I could hug so many of the people I see on this sub.

Now the trick is to stay resolved til you &amp; your therapist come up with a plan.<br/>\nYour 1st therapist might or might not be a fabulous fit/connection for you. Don\u2019t feel discouraged if that happens- it\u2019s not abnormal to have to change- took me 4 to get it sorted. I hope your 1st is a great fit bit don\u2019t stick with someone you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s \u201cclicking\u201d.<br/>\nBig hugs -stay strong</p>\n</div>",

Before I could ever consciously question it, I was pulled out of public school and was \u201chome schooled\u201d.I had no voice, no outside resources, nothing.

At that time is when I began to fall into a state of honest panic because I knew I wasn\u2019t normal in the sense of my home life and that it would cause me a lot of trouble if others found out, so I played happy child. \n\nAs I began to get close to finishing high school, I became violent as I realized that my childhood and way of living at home was very much not normal and was essentially cruel. I had a very messed up childhood and early adulthood, and while my parents have apologized to me and I have forgiven them, I have not forgotten and will not ever provide them a chance to treat me poorly ever again in any manner. \n\nI met my boyfriend within the first month of moving to my current state, I never told him much of my family life up until about 6 months of dating.

My boyfriend was present the entire time, and honestly I feel horrible for him hearing it sometimes. \n\nI am not a broken person, my heart certainly hurts for the little girl I was at times, but now I am bigger and older. Now I can protect that little girl. I can drive now, I\u2019m getting my associates degree this winter, I got into a good bachelors program too!

Why not save for other things, like for retirement or to accrue money for a future home to start a family in, should they want to do so, while being subject to far less interest and a far shorter mortgage period due to having far more money down? Even when that person *did* move out, their standard of living would be higher. And if they had kids while still living at home, how much easier is it to balance raising the kid with all the other responsibilities of working and maintaining a household when you have more than just two adults in the household? I've been in the top 5% income for my age fairly consistently since I was 23 years old and I probably would not have moved out until 30 if I had the option, because even without considering all the work that goes into basic maintenance for a homeowner--which anyone would rather split than shoulder alone--it genuinely would have benefited everyone involved more. Unfortunately, WFH wasn't a thing yet and I did not grow up in an area that had any jobs in my field, so it wasn't an option.\n\nThe \"move out as soon as possible\" cultural attitude is a very intentional, designed American cultural norm, and it doesn't withstand deconstruction unless you understand it for what it is.",
