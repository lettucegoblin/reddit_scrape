        "body": "NTA. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I can see why you wouldn't want a relationship with these people. I'm so sorry that you've been let down by the people that should be supporting you.  \n\nSupport is meant to go inwards--people on the outer rim of a tragedy will grieve, but decency dictates that they support those closer to the tragedy itself (excepting toxic relationships). Socially and morally speaking, your cousins should have put any potential desire/claims for your parents stuff to the side, because you and your sister deserve support. That isn't even touching on the violations and burglary, nor the fact that you only pressed charges because they already disregarded your request to leave your Dad's things alone. You and your sister are going through an incredibly difficult  time, and your family should be supporting you and making things easier. Instead, they've been colossal AHs.\n\nIf you want to try to repair your relationship with grandma.... Your grandma may feel conflicted because she sees the current situation only--where your cousins are facing felony charges and the law agrees with you and your sister; you guys have the advantage. In her eyes, the cousins are at a disadvantage and she is obligated to look out for the weaker party. I recommend that you remind her that you and sister are grieving your Dad's death and do not have the bandwidth to withstand cousin's harmful behavior. You don't have the bandwidth to gamble whether you'll be repaid or get important things back. Cousins might try to say something like 'all OP had to do was ask', but you literally did that--you asked, they disregarded it. You already tried that. You only resorted to the law because a family request wasn't enough for them. But don't focus on that. Just remind Grandma that your cousins violated your Dad's belongings, and failed in their duty to support his grieving children. Tell her you feel let down and hurt by family, and it hurts that she cares more subverting legal consequences than the serious harm they've done to family. Ask her why no one has tried to make this right, and ask why you're expected to radiate support and understanding outwards.",

There were antiques galore in that house but none of them were mine so I wasn\u2019t taking a thing. Cousins showed up on the third day and right after the funeral started asking what was \u201ctheirs\u201d. Got shut down by my parents and aunts and uncles immediately. Uncle and I had the only keys to the house after that and I stayed in the house for two weeks until the will could be read and items that were named got notes put on them and cash was dispensed to the grandchildren per my grandfather\u2019s wishes as he passed after my grandmother. One cousin threw an absolute fit because she got less and what her mom got wasn\u2019t what she wanted to inherit one day. I ended up with more because I was the one who moved there to care for them and my hubby (fianc\u00e9 then) was given a nicer ring (grandfather had been a jeweler) because he came around and helped out however he could. Death brings out the greed in people instead of grief a lot of times. Keep the charges against them, they stole not only from you and your sister but also from your parents and their memory.",

Which said brother took it upon himself shortly after her passing, not even 24 hours later to break into our apartment where the fire took place and start stealing things. Luckily I had a neighbor who knew my family and phoned me the moment they saw him. As I arrived he had a trash bag in hand filled with my mother's jewelry and another one in his car filled with most of her belongings and some of my own things that clearly had some cash value. His excuse was \"I was making sure no one broke in and stole all these things\" Even though the entire apartment was boarded up and he had to use a crow bar to break in.. still fills me with rage to this day.",

Then they went through the whole house, including *our* property, our bedrooms, *everything*, telling us, we want this, we want that, etc. Most of the things they were demanding we hand over were never even grandpa's to begin with. It was mostly stuff we brought with us when we moved in. \n\nWhen we explained this to the girlfriend she started screaming at us and telling us how selfish we were for trying to keep everything for ourselves, and how my uncle's father had just died and we were heartless for not giving him anything they wanted so he could grieve. \n\nUltimately they didn't get anything beyond the items that had been arranged for beforehand. So after the funeral, the girlfriend grabbed all the flowers off of his coffin and grave and took them home with her for her place. I kid you not.

Her mom died when she was 24, and great grandpa was apparently so in love with his 10 years older wife/cousin that he drank so much \"she had to pay the mortgage so the bank put the house in her name.\" Not her brother's. Or even her sister who was the oldest. Just her, the middle child.\n\nNo one knew this, least of all his NEW wife who was not Irish and NOT Catholic. (And less controversially, she was younger than his oldest daughter.) She was also from out of state... I guess great grandpa went on a trip there and convinced her he was rich. She has two more sons with him. And now, having found her long sought after sugar daddy, she moves her mom in from out of state and kicks my grandma out of the house SHE OWNS.\n\nFast forward 30 years, great grandpa dies and this gets found out. One of the sons comes to my grandparents house and demands my grandma sign the house over to his mom for $1. Not sure if she did or not, but I guess they JUST figured this out and my mom was witness to this. She couldn't believe her mother OWNED A HOUSE in the 1940s.\n\nBut yeah, this past year I started to doubt the story as it was told to me. I can't imagine a bank would just \"give\" the house to a single woman during WWII. I played with the idea that she got him drunk and had him sign it over, but with all the crazy shit I saw my grandma pull off, I really can't picture her doing that.\n\nNow I'm now wondering if great grandpa knew what his wife was and it was a situation like with you and your grandma. I seriously hope your future relatives will be telling the story 50-80 years later like I am now, haha.",

My MIL also told us before she died that there was an envelope with money in it for him at his aunt&#39;s house, but she claimed (after MIL died) not to know what she was talking about. OP is NTA.</p>\n</div>",

The great granddaughters had pieces set aside for them with their parents.  I gave them their jewelry at the wake.  Every female in the line got something nice.   And still I got shit over it.</p>\n</div>",

Nothing like having your favorite uncle bluntly tell you \u201cI know you\u2019re in the right, but she\u2019s your aunt B\u2019s mother and I gotta sleep sometimes and would rather do it inside the house. You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re married.\u201d\n\nLike\u2026 thanks? Lost my mom, now I love 9/10 members of my maternal family because I did not lay down and let the old bitch rob my house?\n\nAnyway, eventually she drove off what was left of her children, except her beloved youngest son who she pampered and spoiled his whole life. And then (this is all hearsay from my Aunt C who went all double agent, telling the rest of the family she\u2019d cut me off but still talking to me behind their backs and trying to get back some of my things.) she had a stroke and her Precious Baby Boy stuck her in a nursing home. \n\nIt got worse from there. She couldn\u2019t speak or feed herself, but from what doctors told Aunt C, she was fully \u201cthere\u201d and aware of everything. They called it locked on syndrome iirc. So her son (I know he\u2019s technically my uncle but I don\u2019t wanna admit to him) brought fast food to her room and claimed she was eating it. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t. And after roughly a month, she died of starvation. (I have SO many questions why the nursing home staff did not take any action, but knowing her son it was the absolute cheapest option she could find. I worked in a very high end nursing home and sometimes had to nag higher ups to check out clients, so I can imagine at a place like that it\u2019s be even worse.$ \n\nShe got hydration from an IV, but he refused to sign consent for a feeding tube so yeah\u2026 And since my mom (her doormat) was dead and she\u2019d pushed most of her kids and grandkids away, no one found out until after she was either dead or well on her way. (That part is unclear. Aunt C didn\u2019t know until she\u2019d already died, but we think maybe Aunt B visited her shortly before she died.)\n\nMy cousin T went to the funeral (I was in a whole new state and I doubt I would have gone anyway, there was nothing there for me.) and says it was open casket and horrific. She had always been a plump woman but apparently was skeletal and had bruises and crap showing through the mortuary cosmetics. Which is hard to do, btw. That stuff usually covers EVERYTHING. T and C both told me that they were glad they hadn\u2019t brought T\u2019s kids. And we were always a family that brought kids to say their goodbyes. \n\nIt\u2019s a horrible way to go. And selfishly, part of me was bitter that she died too horribly for me to enjoy her being dead at last. If she\u2019d gone less horribly I could say \u201cWell good, she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nBut even a horrible woman like her did not deserve to starve to death while locked into her own body.  \n\nUgh. Sorry for unloading. I\u2019m drunk and sad. You know, even with her dead my uncle hasn\u2019t contacted me? Apparently he ASKS people about me all the time, but he won\u2019t actually call me.

I completely understand how difficult this stuff is to talk about in real life, and sometimes the anonymity of the the internet offers you and opportunity to vent in a way you just can\u2019t normally. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy for years for the stuff my family put me through and it\u2019s so hard to describe it to people who haven\u2019t lived stuff like that because it\u2019s like: for one you get gaslit so much by family like that you begin to question if it really was that bad. And secondly people who have had good families just sometimes can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to believe that people can be so horrible to their own family. \n\nSo when you do hit someone who can understand it\u2019s like holy shit, lol. Here\u2019s someone who can actually get it. Even finding a therapist that gets it is hard sometimes to because they just don\u2019t understand how pervasive generational trauma really can be. Almost every abuser has a traumatic origin story. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you have kids, but I have a little boy and I am always so worried about giving him the childhood I didn\u2019t have and not becoming my grandparents or bio mom. Sometimes I feel so woefully ill-equipped. Like I just don\u2019t have the tool in my tool box for certain emotional jobs because I have no examples of healthy and functional ways to deal with situations. I\u2019m trying to learn and have been trying since before he came along, but life is always throwing out unforeseen challenges. Sorry if I\u2019m rambling here to haha, I\u2019m a bit tired and sad myself as well I guess and am trying to express I know where you\u2019re coming from and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been let down and hurt by your family.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Don\u2019t feel bad for unloading! I completely understand how difficult this stuff is to talk about in real life, and sometimes the anonymity of the the internet offers you and opportunity to vent in a way you just can\u2019t normally. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been in therapy for years for the stuff my family put me through and it\u2019s so hard to describe it to people who haven\u2019t lived stuff like that because it\u2019s like: for one you get gaslit so much by family like that you begin to question if it really was that bad. And secondly people who have had good families just sometimes can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to believe that people can be so horrible to their own family. </p>\n\n<p>So when you do hit someone who can understand it\u2019s like holy shit, lol. Here\u2019s someone who can actually get it. Even finding a therapist that gets it is hard sometimes to because they just don\u2019t understand how pervasive generational trauma really can be. Almost every abuser has a traumatic origin story. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know if you have kids, but I have a little boy and I am always so worried about giving him the childhood I didn\u2019t have and not becoming my grandparents or bio mom. Sometimes I feel so woefully ill-equipped.
