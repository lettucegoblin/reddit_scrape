I just don't trust that he understands that it would be wrong because he can't think like the rest of us, unless he's given straight forward directions. An example would be just taking out and bringing in our garbage cans. He always puts them back where the handle faces the wall. It's more work and no one that can think normally would place them like this. If he isn't told to, he won't check to see if both bins are filled with trash, if he should bring out the stuff that doesn't fit in the bins, etc.\n\nUnless you sit down and explain to him, he had no chance of working it out on his own. I believe the same thing is possible with your nephew. I get that he's autistic but that doesn't mean anything if in a fit of rage, he attacks your wife, your baby, or you if they don't find a way to make him understand what the situation is and his role is in your family. The kid isn't some monster, but his parents also want him to have as happy of a life as they can get for him. Everyone here is acting accordingly. Good luck to you all.",

I do not have the same level of autism or delayed development that is being described in your post. \n\nI have seen the way people placate arrested development and the way it is ignored by anyone who doesn't understand what is going on.\n\nYou already put yourself in an empathetic place the first time that you welcomed them into your home. At that moment in time it should have been a learning experience for the kid, no matter his developmental level. Now even if attempts were made to deal with the issue then it seems as if nothing was going to change and you decided to allow them to return. \n\nAn autistic child does not have the inability to understand their actions, nor do they have the inability to be empathetic towards others. It is within their capabilities but it is very hard to get the ball rolling and it must be done early in life depending on the severity of the autistic child. \n\nThis all being said you gave them the opportunity and it seems as if they even went so far as to enable the issue until it got out of hand. This is far too late, and only confuses the child.\n\nI can only speak from my experiences and understandings but any breakdowns I have experienced are from others telling me my actions are fine because they did not wish to deal with the confusion and potentially negative emotions that I would feel.\n\nAny intervention is better than waiting until the last moment, especially with a child that has arrested development of any kind not just autistic.\n\nYou're not the asshole here.

I do not have the same level of autism or delayed development that is being described in your post. </p>\n\n<p>I have seen the way people placate arrested development and the way it is ignored by anyone who doesn&#39;t understand what is going on.</p>\n\n<p>You already put yourself in an empathetic place the first time that you welcomed them into your home. At that moment in time it should have been a learning experience for the kid, no matter his developmental level. Now even if attempts were made to deal with the issue then it seems as if nothing was going to change and you decided to allow them to return. </p>\n\n<p>An autistic child does not have the inability to understand their actions, nor do they have the inability to be empathetic towards others. It is within their capabilities but it is very hard to get the ball rolling and it must be done early in life depending on the severity of the autistic child. </p>\n\n<p>This all being said you gave them the opportunity and it seems as if they even went so far as to enable the issue until it got out of hand. This is far too late, and only confuses the child.</p>\n\n<p>I can only speak from my experiences and understandings but any breakdowns I have experienced are from others telling me my actions are fine because they did not wish to deal with the confusion and potentially negative emotions that I would feel.</p>\n\n<p>Any intervention is better than waiting until the last moment, especially with a child that has arrested development of any kind not just autistic.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not the asshole here.

The person in question didn\u2019t particularly have violent tendencies only occasionally when something happened they didn\u2019t like so they would get frustrated and throw things. \nOthers could be overly affectionate and hug you really tight but then wouldn\u2019t let go one of the residents hugged me after I\u2019d come back from annual leave (I\u2019m 5\u20193) they were at least 6ft and as they were doing it I could feel myself being crushed and the more I tried to get them off the tighter they\u2019d hug, to the point I was being lifted slightly off the floor and I had to pull my alarm for assistance. Obviously it was a form of affection but for me personally it was terrifying, residents weren\u2019t usually allowed to act that way with staff but sometimes it was easier on everyone if you\u2019d give a quick hug so they wouldn\u2019t feel rejected and avoid an incident. \n\nYou are not an asshole for wanting to protect your family it\u2019s totally understandable even if your nephew doesn\u2019t show any violet tendencies people are unpredictable and it only takes a split second. Better to be safe than sorry if you ask me, but it also doesn\u2019t mean that your nephew has intent to hurt your child or wife. Maybe it might be worth explaining this better to his parents because they might have just seen their ass because you\u2019ve asked them to leave because of their son.

Obviously it was a form of affection but for me personally it was terrifying, residents weren\u2019t usually allowed to act that way with staff but sometimes it was easier on everyone if you\u2019d give a quick hug so they wouldn\u2019t feel rejected and avoid an incident. </p>\n\n<p>You are not an asshole for wanting to protect your family it\u2019s totally understandable even if your nephew doesn\u2019t show any violet tendencies people are unpredictable and it only takes a split second. Better to be safe than sorry if you ask me, but it also doesn\u2019t mean that your nephew has intent to hurt your child or wife. Maybe it might be worth explaining this better to his parents because they might have just seen their ass because you\u2019ve asked them to leave because of their son. People who are overly protective of their children (I\u2019m guessing they are I would be) often only hear the bad in what people say rather than hear them out.</p>\n</div>",

It would constantly seem like the world is against them. potentially feeling as though they can never catch a break. It is important to be compassionate with the parents. That being said you have absolutely no obligation to make yourselves uncomfortable just to be nice. Should this &#39;crush&#39; be allowed to develop it may also end up being dangerous for your son. If your nephew is genuinely jealous of the attention your wife gives your son and has the potential to melt down in such a way that requires restraint it is best to keep them apart as often as possible.

I have autism (high functioning), and I have had \"social meltdowns\" before (i.e. emotional breakdown relating to something social such as love, friendship etc).  I also know what it's like to *genuinely* not understand boundaries.  As a result, I often violate them and end up paying the social price.

So, if I like a girl, and she smiles at me, she's obviously into me. If she says \"no\", she's playing hard to get, and is also into me.  Basically, we can be delusional.  The sad thing is that your wife was probably super sweet to him, more so than most (if not all) girls he met, and he probably mistakenly took that as a sign of \"She must *really* like me! I have a chance with her!\", and any signs to stop that, well, you're preventing him from seeing his \"girlfriend\" who \"obviously\" likes him.\n\nWhile I've improved significantly over time, I still have great difficulty in social interactions and all the mishaps along the way took a *massive* toll in my self confidence and self esteem to the point where if anything socially bad happens to me (lose friends etc), I *always* assume it's my fault, unless someone can prove me wrong.\n\nThe reason I rambled on (we do this) is that, in addition to wanting to let you know that you're 100% in the right, I also wanted you, and other readers, to get an understanding of what it's like to be on his side, and get a bit of a glimpse of his thought process.  He's not a deranged person, but rather a real human being who was simply dealt the wrong cards in life and is doing all he can with what he has.\n\nEither way, hope it all works out, and the best of luck to your nephew - it's a tough road he's traveling on.",

She had this one adult patient, a young man in his 30s, with a severe form of autism but a very high sex drive. Obviously he had no sense of what's socially acceptable, so if he thought a woman looked pretty, he went ahead and wanted to touch her.

I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not all of them of course, but you can only do so much vetting.

So many places are awful. It\u2019s hard to see which ones aren\u2019t just sweeping stuff under the rugs when you come to visit. The workers CAN be good. But a vast majority seem to hate their job and are there for a pay check.</p>\n\n<p>A parent loves their child. It breaks their heart to know they can\u2019t take care of there son and would have to let a stranger, who doesn\u2019t seem to care, be responsible. I know this because my mom still cries about it.

We were in the waiting room in our hospital once and he kept talking how he likes me and he hasn't had sex ever, and then when I spoke to the doctor and exited through side doors he RAN after me. A huge ass man just thomping after you. Honestly got piss scared, I don't think I ever felt that threatened in my life.\n\nThe worst thing? He's got two relatives who call themselves his \"caretakers\", and both were drinking a beer across the street instead of actually being near him or keeping an eye on his actions. They only stopped him once we exited the building and they noticed he's being aggressive. Told me it's normal for people of that age to feel sexually frustrated and that I shouldn't be angry at him for not being able to control himself once he sees a girl he could consider to be his loved one. Like m8, I'm not angry at him specifically, but you two are absolutely useless. I hear they got threatened with legal actions after that, haven't seen them since.\n\nI mean I do feel bad for him, he's got autism+ the country was in war 20 years ago, so he's really traumatized from knowing it was hapenning around. He used to ride the bus at the same time with local kids when we were going to school, telling us stories about flying the plane in the army and being a general, it was obviously really hard for him to understand reality. But man it's not safe to let someone like that just walk around without someone keeping both him and people around him safe.",

        "body": "not too long ago there was a news article of an autistic man killing his mother over something small. The man in this story is a young adult man who can easily overpower a woman should he ever get the chance. I'm not saying he's evil because unfortunately I don't think he has the mental capacity to understand that it's wrong to declare someone your girlfriend who doesn't want that. But he also has sexual desires and doesn't have the moral compass to restrain himself. I know this from firsthand experience what ugly situations an autistic person can create because they want to satisfy their needs sexually. \n\nIt's unfortunate but I think the parents of this man handled the situation very badly the first time around and even worse the second time. They should have left the house when their son showed romantic interest in OP's wife. It's really terrible to their son and to OP's wife both that they let things progress to the point where the son felt like he could say outright that she's his girlfriend. He's not gonna get over that easily, it's gonna take a long time and a lot of patience on his caretakers' part. However keeping him away would have helped recover from those feeling but they brought him along the second time. And then their response to his renewed interest wasn't to try to show him why he was wrong, it was to 'blame' it on the baby. I know that's not what they were trying to do, of course. But that's what it looks like from their son's perspective. He doesn't understand other people's needs. And in particular he doesn't understand other people's agency over their own selves. That much is obvious from the post. He had to be physically restrained just because OP's wife went to the other room.\n\nIt's a sad affair for everyone involved but it would not have escalated to this point if the parents hadn't brought him along the second time. For this reason, I think what that person said, while badly worded, is not entirely wrong. And this is why I have to say NTA, not because I think these people are actual assholes but because they should have known better about how to handle the situation better. If these people had kept their son away after the first visit, I'd have said N A H. Unfortunately for everyone involved in this situation (including the grandmother who I don't think is an asshole) this is just a shitty, regrettable situation. I don't think OP feels good about asking his relatives to leave. He did the right thing but it still sucks to have to do that. I don't think his relatives are mad at him either. They are probably used to having to leave places because of their son. It's a really shitty situation for everyone. There's no way they could have known this visit would turn out to be such a dumpster fire when they're trying to find work. I feel bad for everyone involved, but there are indeed people at fault here in my opinion.",
