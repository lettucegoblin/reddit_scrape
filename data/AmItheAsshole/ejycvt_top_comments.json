I\u2019d have to sift through hundreds  of names really quickly (all with the same birthday) and a lot of them *did* actually have warrants so I\u2019d have to be very very careful to make sure I didn\u2019t accidentally get an innocent man arrested or let a wanted man walk free.

Fortunately this guy wasn\u2019t wanted and was let go with a warning for speeding. \n\nI say all that to say this:\nPeople who have no identity when they are found dead are put in \u201cthe system\u201d as John Doe or Jane Doe. There\u2019s a good chance that a government employee who isn\u2019t being extremely careful may or may not get your son\u2019s information messed up in the system with a dead person.

John Doe is down in the morgue/basement of the hospital waiting to be ID\u2019d while your toddler John Doe is waiting to be seen upstairs for a high fever/flu on a Saturday evening when all doctor\u2019s offices are closed (because kids always seem to get sick when the doctor\u2019s office is closed).
