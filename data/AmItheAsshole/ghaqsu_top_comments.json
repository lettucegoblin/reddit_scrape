I think, as you pointed out in another comment, counseling is a perfect first step. He needs to step up and grow up or leave at this point.</p>\n</div>",

Maybe you think this will help him listen to you but what if it does the opposite and makes him feel that you caved in on this you will cave in on other stuff. Aside from a conversation and possibly talking about going to a therapist he has gotten away with abusing all of you Scott free. You, your son, daughter and Tippy are the only ones dealing with the abuse. He won, he now doesn\u2019t have to watch the kids or the dog. He gets to play as much as he wants and you are walking on glass. I\u2019m sorry if this is harsh but I grew up in a house similar and as I got older the abuse got worse. To the point that when I turned nine my dad started beating me. By the time I was 15 I had had multiple black eyes from him, bruised where I was wearing long sleeves and pants in 100 degree weather and had 2 herniated discs in my lower back along with 2 disc bulges in my upper back. I also developed fibromyalgia and c-ptsd which are linked to trauma. My mom didn\u2019t leave until he turned violent on her, after she found out he had been having an affair for over a year. He left us (16 yr old me and my 8 yr old sister) alone for a week with no money and no food in the house to go on vacation with his mistress. He cleaned out their saving and retirement accounts.  My mom was in CA helping nurse her sister back to health after she had a liver transplant. It was about 2 months after that that she finally kicked him out 2 weeks before Christmas. I still have issues with men, I still tense up like I\u2019m going to be hit when arguments happen. Yes I have been in therapy on and off since I was 10. I am now 36 and still dealing with it. I am happily married to a wonderful man who understands. My sister is 28 now and she has not ever had a serious long term relationship. She doesn\u2019t last in one longer than 2 yrs. She doesn\u2019t trust well, and thinks all marriages will end in divorce and abuse so why put yourself in that spot. Interestingly enough she was never hit just neglected by him. Even to this day if we need to talk to him we have to reach out to him. It never crosses his mind to check in on his kids. Men like him don\u2019t change and your husband seems to be of a similar cloth. Please be careful and remember long term damage stays with you.

Not just the 8 year old, but the 6month old who is being forced to lay in filth till their poor skin starts to rash. It's horrible, and the fact that he is more worried about you paying him back for a controller (also: don't, you owe him nothing, him losing a controller is nothing compared to what he's putting you guys through) than his own family is troubling. Do you have other family or a friend around who could watch the kids while you're at work? Maybe having a friend or family member watch them while you're at work will really send home the message that he's being an untrustworthy father, maybe it'll wake him up.

Or has he kinda always been this way and now that he can&#39;t hide behind work anymore it&#39;s becoming glaringly obvious?</p>\n\n<p>That doesn&#39;t mean he gets to keep going on like this - it&#39;s dangerous and it&#39;s damaging.  But if you can recognize whether he&#39;s having a mental health crisis vs you really are married to an asshole, that can help you decide what to do going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to you and your family.</p>\n</div>",

Hours.*\n\nAs a fourteen year old, i took care of my younger half brother as my own. I bathed him, i changed his diapers, i fed him, i monitored him while he was sleeping to make sure the blanket didnt suffocate him, I even still have the instinct to turn around and scan the room every five minutes or so when im watching something on my laptop; and i live alone!!! \n\nThis means that your husband has, at the very least, less wits about him than a damn 14 year old child who thought anime was the holy grail and that having Duracell battery color scheme hair was \u201crad\u201d. He had to sit back and listen to a screaming baby for hours(!!!) before being fucked enough to get up and change a baby\u2019s diaper. If your baby isn\u2019t getting diapers changed, what else isnt she getting?!? What if she suffocates alone in a room on bedsheets and he is too busy pew-pewing zombies?? How many times does she eat in a day???? Does she just cry and cry and cry until you get home? Until she tires her little body out and falls asleep? \n\nYou already have proof he\u2019s abusing YOUR BABY through neglect. Now, if he isnt bothered enough to take care of a tender, helpless baby, what do you think he\u2019s doing with your son???? Your son already shows the sign of an emotional injury. He has learned he cannot rely on his father at all. How many times does he feed his son? Is he taking care of your son at all? What is your son doing while he\u2019s infatuated with pixels on a screen?? What is your son learning from his father\u2019s actions? How does this affect them?\n\nYou must do something, not for your sake, not for his sake, but the sake of your children\u2019s well being. Get counseling, move out, give him an ultimatum, divorce him, report him; doesn\u2019t matter. Just do something, or those kids will end up paying for it.

If you end up deciding to divorce this man, you will need proof of his neglect to ensure you receive full custody. Your children should not have to spend a few days a week with a parent who is going to completely ignore them.</p>\n</div>",

He would talk to him in all these goofy voices while playing his games. Kid was smiles and laughing the whole time.

There isn\u2019t an excuse for leaving a dirty diaper on seven hours. You\u2019re going to have to cut back on your hobbies, adjust when you are able to do said hobbies, and most importantly, be prepared to drop everything at the sound of a cry.

But if I could save one mother from making such a minor error that I did, then it's worth it.\n\nI had just turned 13 and due to my own personal circumstance was left to care for a 11mo for very long periods of time. He was just learning how to crawl and he started fussing after needing a diaper change, but I wanted an ice cream first. I took him out of the playpen and placed him at my feet in the lounge room/(my makeshift bedroom) I was just hoping to have a little peace while I enjoy my icecream. Outside of that room was the dining and kitchen, so I walked turning the corner into the dining/kitchen to get myself a ice cream. I immediately returned back with the packet containing the ice cream and opened it because I didn't want to leave him unsupervised. Then I realised I needed to put the wrapper in the kitchen bin. Unfortunately, as I went to open the plastic a corner of the packet dropped on the floor. I regretfully did notice it, but was too young and nieve to consider the reality of how fast it can all go wrong. I intended to just watch him and pick it up later, I remmeber thinking that he wouldn't/couldn't find and get too it that fast. I was honestly gone maybe all of 2 minutes, when I came back to the room my focus was 100% back to him, making sure he was okay. I didn't notice anything weird, he had crawled a bit further than expected, but being night time he just looked like he was exploring the grout in the tile flooring (he'd often poke at it). I sat back down on the couch, he didn't crawl or look up at me, odd.. but I assumed he was preoccupied.\n\nThe light of the TV was the only light I could see him with, so I called his name again. Then while he was still in a crawl position I saw his arms stiff from what I had assumed was him straining to keep his head up, to arms staying stiff but he then slowly bowed his chin almost to his tummy. He now was curled into a ball like fetal position. I watched him do all that, yet in my focus of him I had completely forgotten about the plastic wrapper. But this position wasn't usual, which finally alerted me to a problem. I think I finally got some intuition and adrelanine shot me so bloody fast out of that seat. I flipped the light on and picked him up while kneeling back on the floor with him in my arms. At this point I was frantic and by the time I picked him up he was a bright pink in the face and his eyes were already bloodshot. He made tiny noises I can't and don't want to think about  which finally made me realise he was indeed choking. I held him in my arms and I watched him go from pink, red, purple, and other colours I didn't know could happen. His cheeks and lips very quickly became blue and for a long time I punished myself for wasting time not realising he was choking. I had experienced that kind of hopelessness until then. I could feel his muscle tence and release which made him so much heavier in my arms.\n\nI was only just thirteen, I didn't want to hurt him in trying to help, I didnt want to waste time calling for my intoxicated/passed out mother and have her delay me. I didn't know what I was doing, I needed a doctor. He was not my son but that day I definitely in a way become a mother/woman/adult. I removed emotion and shoved every bit of my hand and fingers I could down his throat to retrieve what was choking him, I now didn't care if I scratched or damaged something, he had to live. But it's important to know that in those moments you are fully aware that their are no guarantees. First try was unsuccessful, he just made some horrible sounds, second try I tipped him to his side and leaned the rest of his body diafnonly across on my upper thigh. and gave it everything I had. I felt the slightest tip of plastic so far down his windpipe, my fingers barely touched it. I went for it and If my nails had of been a milameter shorter I would have never of reached it. I don't know why, but I shoved my finger down his throat again to ensure he committed again before taking another breath while holding his current breath. I didn't have any prior understanding of breathing in stomach fluid but I intuitively felt he needed one more second before taking a big breath. I threw him up on my shoulder from where  tummy meets chesty ribs length held him diagonally while minting his posture with the back of his neck in the crest of my palm. Then literally planking him down over my shoulder on a slight diagonal position. I guess you could call this an extreme baby burping (lol) I did this twice each time checking on his eyes and his ability to be conscious, then I heard him make a noise and I looked again at him before blowing air on his face. When he didn't take a deep breath I proceeded with one more of extreme baby burping then a I waited literally a second before giving CPR. \n\nImportant footnote: only \"responsible\" parent was passed out and never took us to a doctor anyway. \n\nA little scary, but when you're in that position something takes over you and you don't know why you act the way you do. But iv since enrolled in nursing and it seems i may have intuitively tried to prevent him from breathing in his vomit. I didn't know how to do that for a baby, so I resumed with one more extreme baby burping before he was able to cry again and let me know it bothered him. He then gave me the blessing of a little bial and for some reason that made me feel at ease along with clear cries. He lived, he's alive, he's happy, he has some genetic disabilities and some that are?? Now many  years later both of us are away from her.... \n\nYes, he's alive, id hate to imagine what would happen if I was gone any longer than two minutes.",

It was really easy. </p>\n\n<p>Even once he got bored I&#39;d put him on the floor in the absurdly baby proof room with me and his toys and keep half an eye on him and talk to him. It really wasn&#39;t a big hassle at all. </p>\n\n<p>If dumbass 16 year old me figured that out then this grown ass father could definitely do it. He doesn&#39;t care.</p>\n</div>",

I had a deal with myself that whatever happens, my addiction for games would never get in the way of my bond with my daughter, or my relationship with my wife.\nI work from home, even before the virus, and I don't play untill I've put her to bed. I'm always the one who baths her (great bonding time), and I try to keep daily interactions at a maximum so she reacts positively when she sees me.\nI'm not saying this to toot my own horn, as I make bunch of mistakes and still have to work on myself as well, but when you decide to become a parent, you decide to put everything else before yourself. I want my daughter to be happy, and I want her to be happy when she sees me. I'm glad to say this is happening.\n\nSo here's some advice.\nWhen  you're addicted to gaming, you wake up wanting to play. Everything that puts it off is annoying once you've got your mind set on it. When my baby was born I didn't play for the first two months or so, as I didn't want anything fogging my brain when caring for my daughter. This really helped and put things in proportion. Sometimes when you play,  you don't even realize you don't want to play anymore. I would rather watch a movie with my wife, but I can't say no.\nSo, first off - he needs a break from playing. Only after this break will he understand how bad things were. But he needs to understand this, and not be ordered to do this. You two need to come to an agreement. If can do this, the road is much easier.\n\nSecond - time frame for gaming. If he doesn't know when to stop, even to take care of your baby, he needs to play at certain times only. Preferably when you are home, in the beginning, so he can play knowing that the baby is ok no matter what. Also, when he has free time and does other things with it, he'll find that it makes him feel better. Less stressed, less anxious.\n\nLastly - you guys. I think I've only just realized this. My wife and I were so busy taking care if the baby, being tired, and looking for so free time to ourselves, we neglected each other. This also made us angry towards each other. Her birthday was a few days ago, and I really went all out. This reminded us that we love each other, and we've been growing closer. I suddenly realized that we've barely hugged since she was born, as were in survival mode.\nSome nights I play, others I don't even though I could, and others I spend time with my wife and watch something together. And I always ask her if she wants the TV before I play.\n\nThere are some mental boundaries he needs to set for himself, but he needs your help getting there. Do this patiently. Game addiction is a thing, and if it's getting in the way of you daughter's health, it's a problem.\n\nGood luck!",
