I have seen this with some of my friends, and one of the ways it manifests is in a power play with the daughter in law. It can be passive-aggressive or overtly aggressive. \n\nI have also seen this destroy marriages when the son is invested in the relationship with the mother over the relationship with the wife. The son is the only one who can stop it, but he has to 1) perceive the problem, and 2) face his mother down.\n\nMany times it is a mother who is totally lost without her children, but other times it can be a mother who is unwilling to allow the daughter in law to take what she sees as her place. Both scenarios are sad in their own way, and both require hurting the mother to resolve. It is an unenviable situation to be in.\n\nI think every mother struggles with her child getting married and making a life without her. I know I did. I figured out that despite the realities of aging, I had a lot of life, a lot of interests, and a lot to pursue - along with the resources to do so. I also have a husband who says \"let's go!\" I can see, though, how a woman who perceives that she has none of these things could fall into the trap.\n\nI wish you luck.

It makes sense that you should have a choice to throw it out or save it (even if in anger) but also logically depending on a number of factors and priorities. Just because his plans didn\u2019t pan out (or worse, his mom manipulated him) doesn\u2019t mean that he should expect your dinner to be waiting on him still. \n\nHe is incredibly rude for leaving in short notice when he sees/knows that you\u2019ve cooked dinner. Your MIL is super conniving and kind of sick for trying to drag her son back to her house with food. My mom doesn\u2019t do all that but she does do that bragging thing, thinks she can cook everything the best or better than you, or chose to make something better tonight than you\u2014 something like that. It\u2019s soooo annoying. \n\nI disagree with most people on this being a divorce issue. But your husband is definitely a Peter Pan / mamas boy situation, which probably manifests in other ways as well.",
