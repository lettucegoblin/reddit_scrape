If they listen to aunts, uncles, teachers, grandparents, friends\u2019 parents, whatever, they listen to him too. So if he\u2019s giving them rules or guidance, they treat him with respect. Her comments in the car were disrespectful, no matter who they came from. On the flip side of that, when it comes to day to day care that kids need, it\u2019s maybe not the time to hold them accountable for the shit things they say. Or maybe you could hold them accountable in a positive way. \u201cI want you to know that this is not something I need to do. I\u2019m going to give you this money because you\u2019re important to me. It doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m not your dad, but I still love you. And as part of that I need you to listen to me. Know that when I tell you something it\u2019s to help you. If you keep pushing me away then maybe one day I won\u2019t be there to help you.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

She's been more defiant than usual.  I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because \"she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You&#39;ve spent more time with her than her actual dad in 2 years, than he did her whole life it sounds like.</p>\n\n<p>If the mom isn&#39;t parenting this &quot;she&#39;s just 12, not her fault&quot; and saying he&#39;s not her dad? What can he do? He literally can&#39;t tell her anything, even the mom says so and the mom doesn&#39;t want to parent??</p>\n</div>",

He's inconveniencing her about money she needs for an optional activity.  He could use this as a further object lesson if he choses to by, for instance, making her earn the money or have her get it from her sperm-donor dad.  Given the severity of her bad behaviors, not allowing her to participate in the activity at all would be one potential fair consequence.\n\nO/P is not entirely wrong in having a reaction that can be perceived as having emotion to it.  Rude and hurtful speech is to be avoided SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE of the emotion that will result. So long as this doesn't manifest itself in anger that results in disproportional consequences, this actually reinforces the object lesson.\n\nFull text =============================\n\nNTA.  Not sure if this goes against the grain, but Dio has some hard life lessons she's going to need to learn.  One of those is that if you shit on people, you can't expect them to go the extra mile for you.\n\nNow, I will say, Dio's behavior isn't unusual. It's actually pretty predictable since it sounds like she has a complete pile of horse shit for a bio dad.\n\nShe's going to act out. Her bio dad got her head screwed on wrong. She's also a teen and teens are stupid.\n\nIn this case, I'd say, kids are going to screw up. That's a given. But they also need a path to redeem themselves.\n\nIt is true that Dio is a kid and you need to lower the bar for her behavior. But even as a kid, she needs to understand that actions lead to consequences.\n\nDio can't have it both ways. She can't have you as the father figure in her life when it suits her, but reject you otherwise.  Sorry, Dio. What's this gonna be? You wanted to set the terms? These are the consequences.\n\nPersonally, if it were me, I'd give her a path to redemption.  Is there work she can do that's of any benefit to you at all?  Clean the bathrooms in the house?  Wash the car?  Give her a chance to earn that money.\n\nBut also, personally, if it were me?  Kid comes home in a squad car (or in this case, you have to pick her up so she won't come home in a squad car), guess who gets no privileges for a year?  You're home. You're studying.  You need to fly right for a while before you get any privileges back.\n\n\"You're not my dad, you can't do that\".  Okay, no problem.\n\nYou seem to want to define our relationship as one where I don't have any relationship to you. That's fine if that's what you want.  If our relationship is transactional?  Then, there are 3 bathrooms in this house. Get to cleaning.  The job pays $25.  That's enough to pay for your school activity fee.\n\nYou also deserve better from Mara. She needs to let you know what she thinks the limits should be, here.  And sorry, but that deadbeat dad can cough up a school activity fee.  Nobody's that broke.  Dio is Mara's responsibility. If she wants your help, she needs to work with you.\n\nNTA.  I'm on your side on this one based on your account of the situation.\n\nEdited to add:  other folks are saying this guy is being petty.  Look if he was standing at the kitchen saying, \"whoa, you don't get food. If I'm not dad, you don't get food\" that would be a different situation ENTIRELY.\n\nHe's talking about money for a sports activity at school. That's not a right. That's a privilege.  A privilege that it's a freakin' marvel she's still allowed to participate in given that she almost just got arrested.\n\nThis isn't money she needs. This is a \"nice to have\" situation.  This is a luxury. You screw up?  Get in trouble with the law? Start mouthing off disrespectfully? This is the first thing that goes.\n\nIf he was withholding necessities?  Yeah, that'd be dickish. There's no natural law that says she has to play school sports, though. All over the country, kids don't play school sports because they can't afford it. THAT is sad.  But not being able to play school sports because you acted out and got in big trouble then acted like a jerk about it? That's more like a very, very, very necessary life lesson.\n\nPeople are right: Dio's going to act out a LOT based on her personality and based on her shitty bio dad and probably also due to some ennabling behavior from Mara.  (No offense, I'm not trying to attack Mara here. Just calling it like it is.)\n\nThe WORST thing you can do right now is let her get away with completely unacceptable behavior. She HAS TO learn that there are consequences for actions. That's what a responsible adult does.\n\nEven though it sounds like it's \"being mean\" to the kid, it's not. It's what the kid needs most.\n\nEdited one more time to add: folks are saying \"But you got mad. This isn't about punishment. This is about you, the adult, getting your feelings hurt.\"\n\nI think that's a very narrow and uncharitable reading of events.\n\nWhat we have here, based on the account, is Dio doing two bad things, both of which require some sort of discipline\n\n1. She almost got arrested, after committing a crime.\n2. She lashed out and said something disrespectful and hurtful.\n\nI have NO IDEA what the punishment was for #1. But it sounds an awful lot like when O/P tried to bring up that this was unacceptable behavior, daughter did #2, then the mom basically backed the daughter up.  The child should have been punished for item #1.  No idea what became of that, but it appears that the O/P is not allowed to deal with that situation.\n\nItem #2, though? In and of itself, is a transgression.  A child is simply not allowed to speak to an adult authority figure in such a disrespectful tone in a situation where the child is entirely in the wrong.\n\nThe father's reaction (freudian slip... the O/P's reaction) was a direct result of that.\n\nNow, I get what you're thinking. \"Well, yeah, she should have been punished, but he's making it about him.  He's getting emotional.  He's not punishing her for the behavior. He's just personally hurt.\"\n\nNO. That's completely wrong.\n\nSo, if he says, \"okay, that really fucking pisses me off and hurts me.  No fucking money for your optional activity\" that's bad?\n\nBut if he said, \"Meep morp. I'm a robot. I have no emotion.  What you said can be construed by human organic entities as emotionally sub-optimal. For this reason, you shall suffer the economic consequence of not being able to pay for human adolescent sportsball.  Meep morp.\"\n\nThat's okay?\n\nThe point of this type of negative reinforcement is that you connect an undesireable activity with a negative consequence.  You form that association so as to discourage future undesireable activity.  (Yes, I'm aware of the limitations of discipline.  Positive reinforcement should be employed whenever possible. However, some behaviors are so eggregious that some form discipline is appropriate.)\n\nWhat he did was, \"You give me shit? You don't get money for your shit.\"\n\nThat is textbook discipline.\n\n\"But he included his emotion in it.\"\n\nYES, of course he did. Because HALF THE POINT OF THIS IS TO SHOW THAT IF YOU ARE DISRESPECTFUL AND CRUEL, IT HAS EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES.\n\nWhat he did here actually draws a STRAIGHTER line between actions and consequences. It actually REINFORCES the learning to show that emotion is involved, here.\n\nIf you told your mom, \"you're a fat bitch and really stupid\" and she says, \"that comment is hurtful, child spawn. confine yourself to your sleeping quarters for one hour\".  What does a child learn?\n\nBut if you tell your mom, \"You're a fat bitch and really stupid\" and she begins to cry, then says, \"You go to your room and don't come out until i say you can\".\n\nShe's not being emotionally abusive, here.  And her reaction will leave an impression.  You just learned that you really hurt your mom.  If you grow up as a normally emotionally functoning person, you will avoid this in the future.\n\nI understand the reluctance to interject emotion into this.  Because frequently, that emotion is anger.  And that can lead to disproportionate or inappropriate punishments.\n\nBut the harm, here, is inherently emotional.  It is universal that if you say hurtful things to people that you will likely encounter an emotional response and that you will damage your relationship with that person.  That's a fundamental life lesson.\n\nAnd yes, you love your kids unconditionally. But that doesn't mean you disregard behavior that, in any other context, would be considered abusive.  It is your obligation as a parent to react in a way that makes it clear this behavior is not acceptable.\n\nHis reaction, frankly, seems chaotic at first. But it is, actually, the exact reaction he should show. And it illustrates the problem with her behavior much better than trying to do this while removing the emotion from the equation.\n\nThe emotion reinforces the object lesson. It doesn't detract from it. And he doesn't seem overly emotional to me.  He just makes it very clear, \"what you said was hurtful.  I'm going to inconvenience you for it.\"\n\nYou may not see that as textbook discipline, but it is.  You don't always deal with kids by hosting a tribunal.",

The child should have been punished for item #1.  No idea what became of that, but it appears that the O/P is not allowed to deal with that situation.</p>\n\n<p>Item #2, though? In and of itself, is a transgression.  A child is simply not allowed to speak to an adult authority figure in such a disrespectful tone in a situation where the child is entirely in the wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The father&#39;s reaction (freudian slip... the O/P&#39;s reaction) was a direct result of that.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I get what you&#39;re thinking. &quot;Well, yeah, she should have been punished, but he&#39;s making it about him.  He&#39;s getting emotional.  He&#39;s not punishing her for the behavior. He&#39;s just personally hurt.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>NO. That&#39;s completely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>So, if he says, &quot;okay, that really fucking pisses me off and hurts me.  No fucking money for your optional activity&quot; that&#39;s bad?</p>\n\n<p>But if he said, &quot;Meep morp. I&#39;m a robot. I have no emotion.  What you said can be construed by human organic entities as emotionally sub-optimal. For this reason, you shall suffer the economic consequence of not being able to pay for human adolescent sportsball.  Meep morp.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s okay?</p>\n\n<p>The point of this type of negative reinforcement is that you connect an undesireable activity with a negative consequence.  You form that association so as to discourage future undesireable activity.  (Yes, I&#39;m aware of the limitations of discipline.  Positive reinforcement should be employed whenever possible. However, some behaviors are so eggregious that some form discipline is appropriate.)</p>\n\n<p>What he did was, &quot;You give me shit? You don&#39;t get money for your shit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That is textbook discipline.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But he included his emotion in it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>YES, of course he did. Because HALF THE POINT OF THIS IS TO SHOW THAT IF YOU ARE DISRESPECTFUL AND CRUEL, IT HAS EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES.</p>\n\n<p>What he did here actually draws a STRAIGHTER line between actions and consequences. It actually REINFORCES the learning to show that emotion is involved, here.</p>\n\n<p>If you told your mom, &quot;you&#39;re a fat bitch and really stupid&quot; and she says, &quot;that comment is hurtful, child spawn. confine yourself to your sleeping quarters for one hour&quot;.  What does a child learn?</p>\n\n<p>But if you tell your mom, &quot;You&#39;re a fat bitch and really stupid&quot; and she begins to cry, then says, &quot;You go to your room and don&#39;t come out until i say you can&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s not being emotionally abusive, here.  And her reaction will leave an impression.  You just learned that you really hurt your mom.  If you grow up as a normally emotionally functoning person, you will avoid this in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I understand the reluctance to interject emotion into this.  Because frequently, that emotion is anger.  And that can lead to disproportionate or inappropriate punishments.</p>\n\n<p>But the harm, here, is inherently emotional.  It is universal that if you say hurtful things to people that you will likely encounter an emotional response and that you will damage your relationship with that person.  That&#39;s a fundamental life lesson.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, you love your kids unconditionally. But that doesn&#39;t mean you disregard behavior that, in any other context, would be considered abusive.  It is your obligation as a parent to react in a way that makes it clear this behavior is not acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>His reaction, frankly, seems chaotic at first. But it is, actually, the exact reaction he should show. And it illustrates the problem with her behavior much better than trying to do this while removing the emotion from the equation.</p>\n\n<p>The emotion reinforces the object lesson. It doesn&#39;t detract from it. And he doesn&#39;t seem overly emotional to me.  He just makes it very clear, &quot;what you said was hurtful.  I&#39;m going to inconvenience you for it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You may not see that as textbook discipline, but it is.  You don&#39;t always deal with kids by hosting a tribunal.</p>\n</div>",

Did she use that situation to get an education or job training so she could be independent?  Is she marginally employed?  Is she actively working toward improving her employment and pay prospects?

It\u2019s their partners who fucked up previously, not them. This fella has been happily acting as a father figure and has clearly got no respect for it.

I cut her off after I realized she got pregnant with her second on purpose, and she bitched and moaned about it being a girl because she \"just knew her daughter would be a sl*t.\" People this deep into the cycle don't know how to raise kids. They basically just watch them grow up with minimal interventions and assume this shit is set in stone, which really just begs the question \"why did you have kids even after you felt like your own childhood was so miserable? Why have children born into miserable situations that you do nothing to help and support?\" It baffles the mind and breaks the heart.\n\nI don't feel like OPs actions were right, but I also don't feel like he was given any right options (other than maybe to leave this shitshow, but that would only be right *for him*).

The kid should not be going to her mom's boyfriend and asking for money anyway, she should be at most reminding her mom of the costs she's agreed to pay when she signed her up for that sport, and then Mara should be talking to OP about it if it's considered a household expense or just dealing with it if it's not.",
