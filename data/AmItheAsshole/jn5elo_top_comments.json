If the egging/TP did any paint damage (or just the cost of having the car cleaned of the egg...I had my car egged yrs ago in front of a friend&#39;s house in the summer...it was awful to clean in terms of work and carwashes), the 18 yr egger needs to pay OP, not OP &quot;forgiving the money&quot; or even paying her.<br/>\nOP is so NTA here.  There is good clean fun of teens, like TPing a house (a waste of good TP during an pandemic but &#39;clean&#39;), but egging a car (or a house, anything) in the heat is NOT fun, it&#39;s vandalism.  Not sure whether it will rise to a felony like the family asserted, but if life is just, the egger will have a misdemeanor on her record and some kind of legal punishment.  She sounds like a spoiled kid, and her parents sound like enablers (or passive-aggressive).</p>\n</div>",
