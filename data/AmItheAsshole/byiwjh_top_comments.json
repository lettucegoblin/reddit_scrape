Best case scenario, she would've talked things out, vented and realize she has a good sibling. OP convinces her to take the post down and make amends saying that private things should stay private and that people make mistakes.\n\nIf the guy found out about his sexuality and cheated on OP's sister, it's completely understandable that she lashed out at her ex the way she did. It's also hugely manipulative by the ex to frame things the way he did as well. Also, private messages between him and OP's sister should stay private **especially** if they're emotionally charged. Showing people private messages is some teenager bullshit that people need to grow out of.\n\nNow, OP has only heard one side of the story, burnt the bridge with his sister by not sounding her out and completely destroyed relationships that her sister might have had. He could've helped her realized that her hate is misguided and helped her cope.\n\nOf all the paths that OP could choose, he choose the one which makes everyone unhappy. Even if he had heard her side, consulted with OP's parents and disagreed, he could've written, I've heard both sides of the story and in the interest of privacy, there's reasons why both sides have acted the way they did. I ask that the friends of either of them help them heal and we leave this to rest.

They might feel inadequate or like they&#39;re not enough for their partner because they know their partner also enjoys things that they can&#39;t give. They may be wrong to think that and it may be unfair to the partner, especially if they have assured them that they are perfectly satisfied, but I don&#39;t think having insecurities makes someone a bad person or a bigot. </p>\n\n<p>I would hope that most people would be willing to try to work through insecurities like that but they aren&#39;t obligated to. If a person is uncomfortable they aren&#39;t obligated to work through that discomfort and continue on. </p>\n\n<p>Is it really any different than a woman who has no interest in ever doing anal deciding she doesn&#39;t want to be with a guy who has done it and likes/liked it? Perhaps he swears up and down he&#39;s perfectly satisfied without it, but she still feels inadequate and struggles to manage that insecurity. Is she a bad person for choosing to leave the relationship instead of continue to struggle?</p>\n</div>",
