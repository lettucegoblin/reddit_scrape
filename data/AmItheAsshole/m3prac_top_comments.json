You would think, this being a liberal college and all, that the women (yes, it was only women, the one man dropped after the first assignment) would be at least feminist-adjacent for the most part. \n\nWell. When our prof told us that 1) she hadn't been prepared for the work that goes into raising children and 2) that she considered them relative blips in her life esp as it came to her career... 90% of the class began to berate her. Actively berate her, as students in her classroom! They told her that she should have never had kids. That if she didn't think they were the most important things in her life, she should have given them up for adoption to people who \"would actually love them.\" And the thing was, both her kids were fully grown, highly successful (literally one is a doctor and the other a lawyer), and themselves considered her a great mother!\n\nAll this to say - screw those people. You are your own person, you are YOU before you are a mother, and while yes, children are important and should be loved, they are not the end all be all of womanhood. Like yeah, raising well behaved, well adjusted children is an accomplishment, quite a bit of it comes down to the children themselves - no parent is the monolith upon which a child's personality and temperament and success rests.",

That may mean you are a good parent (not always the case tho) but it does not go beyond that. You live an entire life, before and after kids. Your life does not start when you have kids. Why do people assume this? What is so wrong about a woman/lady/lass mentioning their achievements in life if it isn't about kids? Woman are not childbirth machines. They are HUMANS, humans with thought, emotions, feelings, achievements, life goals, etc.(don't wanna make this too long) people should learn that men as well as women have lives outside of their kids(or \"god forbid\" absence of kids) like what the heck peoples?",

In my experiences the identity loss is more common among SAHMs when most of their interactions are with their kids, that they barley can talk about other topics than kids after a while, sometimes they even talk like they and their kids are the same person. For example: M: how are you?  P: oh good, we are teething/this will be our first day in school... M: what do you do if you have some free time?  P: we go the play ground/bouncing castle... M: how is your husband/wife/your relationship?  P: good, s/he took kid to grandma's because kid wanted to play with the puppy..(and keeps talking about kid).. \n\nThose SAHMs who know there is life apart from motherhood, can talk about a variety of topics etc. are cool.",

It would be my kid. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also seeing a lot of derision in this thread for sahm&#39;s (not from you, just in general). My MIL is probably a stereotypical example of this--had kids young, never really had a career, has made her family her primary focus even now that the kids are adults. She&#39;s actually a very complex person with a ton of interests and skills, she just happened to be born into a different family at a different time.  So often we end up in lives that don&#39;t allow us to realize our full potential in some ways. A SAHM who leans into what she&#39;s doing with positivity is something to be admired in my opinion, not looked down upon. </p>\n\n<p>I *am&quot; aggressively side-eyeing the fact that OP was supposed to consider it her greatest accomplishment when a guy wasn&#39;t. Giving birth is not the hard part of raising kids. And OP is definitely NTA.  Just wanted to offer a different perspective.</p>\n</div>",

The intentional work we put into healing we did individually and together to overcome our childhood traumas and baggage and to forge a healthy partner relationship. The healthy, respectful relationship we are trying to forge with our child will hopefully be an accomplishment we can all claim together.

My dad basked in the praise of others for how \"good\" \"respectful\" and \"smart\" we were. Like we were trophies. And then we were failures with character flaws the few times we didn't meet expectations. We all struggled on our own with depression, general anxiety, social anxiety and self esteem/self worth issues trying to live up to being an accomplishment for our parent.
