For the first time in my life I was able to just be me without anyone looking at me sympathetically or gossiping about how poor I probably was, or using stereotypes to judge me. It was great, I made so many friends, joined a sorority, and really came into my own. Because of the things I went through in HS and growing up I didn\u2019t talk about my home life or my hardships/trauma (for which there were a couple)\n\nOne of the older girls in the sorority was often passive aggressive to me, But I don\u2019t think she realized how much shit I could take, and her words always rolled off my back, which probably irked her even more. So one day there was a bunch of us sisters hanging out in the student center with some fraternity guys having a giant study session. Someone had an article about The IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) in my state and showed me. I forgot what it was about exactly but it involved a giant inflatable Rat. Without thinking I exclaimed \u201cThat\u2019s my dads Union and Local!\u201d I slipped, this is the most I had ever said about my life before college, So the older girl jumped on it, and thinking she was slick, said \u201coh? So your dad blows rats for a living?\u201d While smirking. Everyone was looking at me, some laughing, and without missing a beat I calmly looked her in the eye, smiled, and said, \u201cNo, my dads dead.\u201d  The look on her face was priceless. She tried to embarrass me, and was humiliated when she failed, same thing with you and Matt. Nothing about our statements make us the AH, they humiliated themselves. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t handle it being thrown back in your face. \n\nAnd in the long run, she stopped trying to mess with me and we actually became really close, and even roomed together for a semester the following year.",

It was great, I made so many friends, joined a sorority, and really came into my own. Because of the things I went through in HS and growing up I didn\u2019t talk about my home life or my hardships/trauma (for which there were a couple)</p>\n\n<p>One of the older girls in the sorority was often passive aggressive to me, But I don\u2019t think she realized how much shit I could take, and her words always rolled off my back, which probably irked her even more. So one day there was a bunch of us sisters hanging out in the student center with some fraternity guys having a giant study session. Someone had an article about The IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) in my state and showed me. I forgot what it was about exactly but it involved a giant inflatable Rat. Without thinking I exclaimed \u201cThat\u2019s my dads Union and Local!\u201d I slipped, this is the most I had ever said about my life before college, So the older girl jumped on it, and thinking she was slick, said \u201coh? So your dad blows rats for a living?\u201d While smirking. Everyone was looking at me, some laughing, and without missing a beat I calmly looked her in the eye, smiled, and said, \u201cNo, my dads dead.\u201d  The look on her face was priceless. She tried to embarrass me, and was humiliated when she failed, same thing with you and Matt. Nothing about our statements make us the AH, they humiliated themselves. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t handle it being thrown back in your face. </p>\n\n<p>And in the long run, she stopped trying to mess with me and we actually became really close, and even roomed together for a semester the following year.</p>\n</div>",

It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.\n\nWe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.\n\nCue a question I drew: \"What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?\"\n\nSome backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.\n\nI didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, \"Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\nEveryone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said \"well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nIf things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement.

The fake/less serious answers usually provide laughs between the more serious &quot;develop incurable schizophrenia&quot; &quot;cancer comes back&quot; &quot;death of my daughter&quot; answers. There&#39;s a greater comfort in anonymity in these kinds of games where a therapy environment is not the expectation. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to party games? I&#39;d remove those cards, depending on the crowd and the goal for the night. If it&#39;s supposed to be a light hearted night, no one wants to honestly answer questions about fears/trauma. And if it&#39;s a night where honesty/down mood is fine, I&#39;d still remove the questions, depending on who I invite. I don&#39;t want to force someone to relive past trauma, and I can anticipate which questions would have that outcome, depending upon the audience.</p>\n</div>",

I was having a tough time a few years ago that I\u2019ll not go into, but I had to really fight with myself to acknowledge that it was actually hard because I knew other people who had gone through similar things and I kept telling myself that they all had it worse than I did. Maybe they did, but that didn\u2019t negate my own crappy experience. Just because someone\u2019s been through worse doesn\u2019t mean your experience isn\u2019t bad too. If anyone else had openly told me that \u2018at least it\u2019s not as bad as so and so\u2019 I would have started to feel guilt on top of everything else that was going on in my head. NTA op. You don\u2019t have to justify or reveal that things in your life have been crappy if you don\u2019t feel comfortable.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I hate that! You can\u2019t tell how much damage something has done, even if it seems insignificant to you. The worst thing is it can become ingrained into your own way of thinking. I was having a tough time a few years ago that I\u2019ll not go into, but I had to really fight with myself to acknowledge that it was actually hard because I knew other people who had gone through similar things and I kept telling myself that they all had it worse than I did. Maybe they did, but that didn\u2019t negate my own crappy experience. Just because someone\u2019s been through worse doesn\u2019t mean your experience isn\u2019t bad too.

That usually is rooted in people being vulnerable with one another. So I think as long as both parties enthusiastically want to participate, it probably can be a very meaningful and worthwhile experience.
