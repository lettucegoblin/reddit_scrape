It\u2019s my policy that I avoid discussing anything that might cause my coworkers to have it out for me because a lot of people are secretly bigoted/toxic. Some people say it\u2019s soul crushing and every minute I spend in the closet will only add to my existential anguish, but it\u2019s not really a big deal to me. As long as I\u2019m not close with someone and they turn out to be homophobic, I don\u2019t give a shit what people think. If I got 7 million dollars to do what I already do then that would be great!\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t pressure or force her to stay in the closet if it\u2019s causing her too much distress, then you only helped her by warning her about your father. At the end of the day the choice is up to her, you just gave her the full picture.

Staying closeted is not all or nothing, and every LGBTQ+ person chooses who we are and are not safe coming out to on a case-by-case basis. Whether we should come out to a specific person is a decision where we have to find a way to balance our emotional well-being and the logistics of coming out. Part of being a trusted friend/ally is providing someone with the information that they need to make an informed decision based on the actual consequences of coming out to someone. That is true in small situations, (Hey, friend, [person] is/isn\u2019t homophobic, so speaking openly around them will/won\u2019t have consequences) or much more important situations like the one you\u2019re in. Either way, as frustrating as it may be that hiding who we are is sometimes the better option, it is very important that we understand the situation that we are in and the people that we are around.\n\nExplaining the reasons why she may not want to come out to her grandfather is only a bad thing if you\u2019re seeking to manipulate her into staying closeted for your comfort rather than having a good faith conversation with her about what will help her stay happy and healthy in the long run. It is ultimately her decision and if she chooses not to follow your advice then that is her right, but simply arming her with the information she needs (or being a sober voice that reiterates information she already has but may not be fully considering) is actually you being a good ally.\n\nMy parents have served that purpose for me when it comes to choosing which of my family members to trust, and I\u2019m glad that she has someone supportive to do the same for her. Sometimes we need someone like your wife who will encourage us to live openly and damn the consequences. Sometimes we need someone like you to help us decide if this is really the right situation to say damn the consequences. Either way, you two sound like a kick ass pair of allies, and both of your voices will likely be helpful to her as she navigates the complex issues that she is facing.\n\nThat got long lmao aight byee",

When you feel ready to tell your family, the people who are supposed to love you because of you, you are told to stay in the closet because you could lose a huge sum of money just for your attraction to the same gender (not even because of a relationship or anything). While many queer people (including myself) in this situation would probably stay in the closet with family members or friends who are not trustworthy because of a known death date and a known sum of money, the fact that that love is so conditional is bullshit and i would absolutely understand her needing to come out if her mental, emotional, and spiritual health depended on it (and for many, it does depend on it). I can completely understand coming out regardless of the money, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish. I recognize she has family members who love and support her for who she is. I highly doubt she expects her other family members to give her money if she came out \u2014 and it\u2019s judgmental of you to assume that she would \u2014 but if her family members knew she was disowned because of her sexuality and still didn\u2019t offer her any money upon the death of her homophobic grandfather/parents, that shows selfishness on their parts. Sexuality is a very important identity for every single human \u2014 whether they be straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, polyamorous, or sexually fluid \u2014 and to ask someone to hide that part of themselves for money highlights what we value in society. It\u2019s not selfish of her to come out, even while knowing how much she will get if she chooses to stay in the closet. Coming out is a political act, it\u2019s self-liberating, and it\u2019s important to many queer people\u2019s mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health. I know people who feel like they can\u2019t come out and constantly are suicidal because of it \u2014 coming out can literally save lives. Straight people get it easy because their sexuality is just out there for everyone to see, and they don\u2019t have to fear losing their inheritances or their lives for being who they are. So for someone to choose their authentic self over money is not selfish \u2014 it\u2019s admirable. But if she were to choose to stay in the closet for another year, that\u2019s benefitting her life financially. And in our world, financial stability affects every aspect of life because of the value we place on money. Profit means more than human identity.",
