It all poured into her from both of my parents.\n\nMy parents were also very very bad for each other, and after 30 years finally divorced. When my sister was born they started beating me like I was an adult - black eyes, bloody noses, busted lips, marks all over my hands and legs from trying to defend myself from wire flyswatters and fists and VHS tapes being lobbed at my head. I guess they thought beating me was better thanbeating each other. Almost never touched my sister despite her being just as wild if not more so than I at her younger ages. Additionally whenever my parents had friends around during my childhood, it was always their single druggie friends with no children. When my sister was born that changed, and all of a sudden people were coming over that had little girls my sister's age to play with, but still nobody for me to interact with.\n\nI matured very quickly due to this AND my mom using me as an emotional support pet everytime she had a breakdown or dad went full nuts mode, but she had no ability to empathize back for a very long time. Neither does he. I started cutting my wrists at 14 years old and when they found out, there was no love or support or comfort. They spent weeks screaming at me about how I was a bad son and I made them feel like bad parents and how could I do this and eventually they boiled it all down to me just seeking attention so they didn't have to deal with it and could continue ignoring me, really. Now I still have extreme issues with my emotions and when the tiniest things come along I blow them up into huge ordeals because I'm traumatized about asking for anything.\n\nNow, my sister's 20, an alcoholic, can't keep a relationship, still lives with mom and has never onced moved out, and is generally mean to everybody despite being spoilt so much.\nI moved out at 19 and moved in with my fiance into our own little home, and I was so proud of myself. I had a woman, and a car, and a job, and a house, and would you believe my parents did everything they could to take it all away. My job blocked their phone numbers for calling so much and lying about me to get me fired. Since that didn't work, they laid into me every day about how they hated my fiance and hated me for being with her. My dad left me and her the shittiest voicemails saying I was the stupidest man in the world because according to him I only moved out and into that house so her and I could fuck(like what?), trying to convince us we didn't love each other, trying to convince us I wasn't man enough for her; the wildest craziest shit you'd ever known.\nI had to call off the engagement and lie about why for forever. She was willing to stay despite the abuse, but I couldn't do that to her. I wish I had just pulled a reverse uno card and disowned them afer they threatened to disown me. Ten years later, I haven't been in a committed relationship since out of fear of them doing what they do best and turning what little joy I get into a source of misery, and I'm terrified of becoming a parent because I came from the monstrosity that is my parents. That's me. That's inside me and I hate it so much I break down and cry until my eyes hurt.\n\nKeep your head up, king. Once you're out don't let them back in. If you need it don't be afraid to seek therapy. But more importantly don't forget to choose yourself over them.",

My job blocked their phone numbers for calling so much and lying about me to get me fired. Since that didn&#39;t work, they laid into me every day about how they hated my fiance and hated me for being with her. My dad left me and her the shittiest voicemails saying I was the stupidest man in the world because according to him I only moved out and into that house so her and I could fuck(like what?), trying to convince us we didn&#39;t love each other, trying to convince us I wasn&#39;t man enough for her; the wildest craziest shit you&#39;d ever known.\nI had to call off the engagement and lie about why for forever. She was willing to stay despite the abuse, but I couldn&#39;t do that to her. I wish I had just pulled a reverse uno card and disowned them afer they threatened to disown me. Ten years later, I haven&#39;t been in a committed relationship since out of fear of them doing what they do best and turning what little joy I get into a source of misery, and I&#39;m terrified of becoming a parent because I came from the monstrosity that is my parents. That&#39;s me. That&#39;s inside me and I hate it so much I break down and cry until my eyes hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Keep your head up, king. Once you&#39;re out don&#39;t let them back in. If you need it don&#39;t be afraid to seek therapy. But more importantly don&#39;t forget to choose yourself over them.</p>\n</div>",

Someone in the comments said she should just deal with her fear and it was cowardly to hide. I don't get that at all. Sure, some fears are better to get over, like Raj, in the Big Bang Theory, who is so anxious around women that he becomes mute. That's a crippling fear that needs to be dealt with. But...not wanting to be around abusive people, or people who might potentially bring up bad memories? Why force yourself to deal with that? Why not just respect that fear, like you respect the fear of walking into traffic, or a fear of venemous snakes, and thank it for keeping you safe?\n\nI think this might be something men are more likely to deal with than women. My ex had an attitude like, all fear must be purged. He was scared of heights, so he forced himself to go climbing all the time. He was nervous of cycling in traffic but he still forced himself to commute by bike 2-3 times per week, 17 miles each way, and then had night terrors and cried in the shower. He had a car. He just stuck with it because not doing something because it terrified you wasn't a good enough reason. He hated the idea of being thought of as a coward, so, ironically, admitting to being scared or emotionally vulnerable was his greatest fear.
