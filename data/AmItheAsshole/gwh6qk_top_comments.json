All you did was report the person. If they get fired, it is because they violated workplace policies that were made clear on day 1. If you report an employee, and their employer does not deem it to be problematic, they will not be fired.",

Let me tell you a secret about guys, its a super secret 'guy trick' that only guys know about, so, don't tell anyone when I tell you.\n\nWhen a guy is flirting with a girl, or trying to feel her out on how she stands on things, like ... he wants to see how far he can push the boundaries. He'll do, or say something stupid/inappropriate and then, based on your reaction, say it was a joke.\n\nExample: Cute girl at school, we're friends, I want to ask her out, so I do, she's clearly uncomfortable and says no, then I laugh it off and say I was joking. Hoping to salvage the situation and make things not too weird between us.\n\nExample 2: Cute girl at school, she's my student, I want to sleep with her, and I want to gauge how she feels about that. So I think \"i'll show her porn, see if she's into it\", but I already know I shouldn't do that, so I preemptively say its a joke. Holy shit, she laughed, I think \"she thinks its cute\", score, I'm in. Next time I see her I'm going to make a joke about her breasts, that way I can subtly hint that I'm definitely checking her out.\n\nOne of these examples is your scenario. It's not a joke, its his way of attempting push the boundaries without getting in trouble, because he knows he's doing what he shouldn't be doing. Will he get mad and say you have no sense of humor? probably, he's trying to deflect.\n\nAlso, porn in the workplace? seriously? I've worked in IT, we've fired people when receiving zero complaints, everyone knows that's just something you don't do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit for clarification: in the example I give fore example 2. I don't mean to imply you're somehow at fault for nervously laughing at his \"joke\". I'm just giving it to you from his perspective based on how these types of guys think. He won't read that you were uncomfortable he'll think you were into it, and continue the harassment.*",

This will change his life and possible reputation, but he also should of thought about this before showing porn material to his students. \nIf some guy in the park comes up to you trying to make sexual jokes or show you porn, how would you react? Probably walk/run away or call for help because this is not professional behavior. The good coming out of this is he will be given the choice to change. That&#39;s in a way a gift. \nDo not feel bad about yourself for what others do to you. You are not responsible for others shitty behavior.</p>\n</div>",

I used to be very shy and did not want to start conflict in uncomfortable situations (like letting a drunk guy put his hand on my inner thigh and not telling him off even though my boyfriend was also sitting right next to me and then my boyfriend got mad at me for not saying anything).  But after that and other incidents, I began calling shit out in a very matter of fact way - it's VERY hard to get over the initial doubt and fear you feel, but after practice I gained a ton of confidence (therapy helps too!).  I went to a house party and another drunk guy said, \"Hey, your sweater looks *super soft*, can I touch it?\" I was weirded out but said ok and held my arm out to him. He *moved my arm out of the way and tried to touch my breast.*  I immediately stepped back as he was laughing and said VERY LOUDLY, \"Hey, did you just try to touch my boob?! Why would you do that? I was holding my arm out, why did you think that was ok?\" and it got a couple people's attention by me, they started questioning him and defending me, and he immediately left the house.\n\nIt's a sad fact, but it can be much harder to defend yourself after a situation to outsiders, so calling attention to something while it is happening can give you lots of power and confidence, and you can get immediate feedback on whether you are right or wrong.  In this situation, when he started the video, saying something loudly with people near like, \"Hey, are you showing me porn right now?\" DEFINITELY would grab someone's attention - why is a teacher showing a student porn during a baking class...?  Hopefully someone would have approached and assessed the situation as well, immediately stepped in, and I BET the teacher would have backpeddled hard.  He knew what he was doing was wrong and was not a joke - he called over a *single student* to show *only you* porn.  If it was actually a joke, he would've shown the *entire class* porn.\n\nAnyways, this is all to say that it takes practice and help, but you have your own power, and if things seem weird or wrong, it is **totally ok** to ask other people if they also think it is weird or wrong while the situation is happening, and you can get immediate feedback, and defense from the situation.

I personally think that every topic for humor should be allowed to be joked about, but not all jokes are funny for the same reason. Some examples of what makes a joke funny is shock humor, word play, \"it's funny cause it's true\", call backs/ repetition, absurdity, etc. Most racist and sexist jokes fall under the \"it's funny cause it's true\" category, where the \"true\" thing is some problematic stereotype about people of a certain group. Now of course the people who tell these jokes don't understand this nuance and telling them will just get them mad at you saying you can't take a a joke, but it's funny to lead them to whatever fucked up belief you'd have to assume to think the joke was funny by asking a bunch of innocent sounding questions.",
