She has been indoctrinated into this type of life since she was born, and it's understandable that she wants to keep the peace because that is all she knows.  Help her see that catering to that type of behavior is not healthy.  If you are unable to help, hire someone that can.\n\nYou did the right thing by going to the hotel.  Offering your wife's sisters the option to go on vacation was very generous, and I'm glad they took you up on it.  May I suggest to also extend that offer to your MIL, for all we know she may not like this type of behavior as well, she's just not used to confrontation and also wants to keep the peace at all costs.\n\nI come from an Eastern European family and the patriarchy is big in the culture.  My mom would never speak up to my dad, what he said was gospel.  This lasted until my mom finally had the courage to get out and file for divorce.\n\nYour FIL seems like the kind of person that always gets what he wants.  Some people thrive on that type of power and when they are confronted with someone that takes that power away, they rebel.  By you going to the hotel you took that power from him.\n\nFamily dynamics are complex and there is no one correct answer, but I have no doubt that you already know this and will do the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso wanted to add to keep us posted on the outcome of your extended vacation with your SIL's.

Offering your wife&#39;s sisters the option to go on vacation was very generous, and I&#39;m glad they took you up on it.  May I suggest to also extend that offer to your MIL, for all we know she may not like this type of behavior as well, she&#39;s just not used to confrontation and also wants to keep the peace at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>I come from an Eastern European family and the patriarchy is big in the culture.  My mom would never speak up to my dad, what he said was gospel.  This lasted until my mom finally had the courage to get out and file for divorce.</p>\n\n<p>Your FIL seems like the kind of person that always gets what he wants.  Some people thrive on that type of power and when they are confronted with someone that takes that power away, they rebel.  By you going to the hotel you took that power from him.</p>\n\n<p>Family dynamics are complex and there is no one correct answer, but I have no doubt that you already know this and will do the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also wanted to add to keep us posted on the outcome of your extended vacation with your SIL&#39;s.  Good luck.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "A less dramatic version of this happened to me a year ago. My grandmother invited my mother, my girlfriend, and I to stay over at her house. Unlike you, I never expected to be allowed to sleep in the same bed. It's a small house, so family and friends normally stay on two beds and an air mattress in my mother's childhood bedroom. My partner is close with my parents, so she's basically extended family at this point. If nana took issue with this, I was willing to stay on the couch and leave the beds to my mother and partner.\n\nRecently, my aunt (who has a bossy streak) had been bothering nana about reorganization in the house, so I suppose she was feeling like she needed to take back control of her space. She had also never met my girlfriend in person, and the idea of me even having one was a relatively novel concept for her. However, nana was the one who invited us over, and she had always been an exceptionally generous host in the past.\n\nThis time was different. When we greeted her, she was uncharacteristically cold. Then, she insisted my partner take the couch (even when I offered) so as not to make my mother uncomfortable. The three of us had shared a house for three months during the pandemic, so we were quite comfortable with one another. She banished my partner to the old, uncomfortable sofa anyway. She then proceeded to quietly follow us around the house and fix us with a stare when we so much as held hands. I hadn't seen my girlfriend for months, and I couldn't find a moment alone with her. It was excruciating.\n\nDuring the evening, she watched television late into the night, despite my mother mentioning that my partner was getting ready for bed several times. My girlfriend is chronically polite and wouldn't go to sleep while my nana was still using the room. My mother told me not to intervene (so as not to cause family drama), but I was fuming. After a long day of travel and social interaction with strangers, my partner was swaying, eyelids fluttering with exhaustion.\n\nAfter being treated with coldness and scrutiny for two days, I booked a hotel room. It was expensive for a college student, and my nana was offended. However, I was determined never to subject my partner to that sort of disrespect again. Had we showed up unexpectedly, I would have at least understood my nana's frustration. However, we were invited to visit well in advance. If she was so pleased to see us, she shouldn't have used us to satisfy some misdirected need to reaffirm her own power.\n\nI'm glad you didn't let your in-laws push you around and talked it out with the rest of the family. It sounds like you're all growing as people as a result of this interaction.",

If he had to sleep on a crappy surface for a FULL WEEK, he might actually end up having to go back to the doctor.\n\nI don\u2019t know HOW bad your back is, but no matter what it\u2019s going to sit really poorly with me how your wife\u2014who presumably knows about this pain\u2014was willing to make you literally physically suffer to appease her apparently abusive dad. I think it\u2019s worth talking to her about how unfair that is.

My mom and dad didn't like the hubster, my husband, because his parents were divorced, he lived in the projects and on welfare as a kid, his biological father beat his mother and had multiple gf's until she left with their kids, because he was divorced and had kids of his own, and because he didn't have a college degree. We were engaged a year, but my parents chose not to say anything until 14-hours before the wedding. They didn't oppose it when the preacher asked for any opposed to our getting married. My mother gave him the stink-eye, but spoke as if nothing was wrong.   \n\n\nMy dad changed his mind about the hubster, after I sat down with him and we had a heart-to-heart about the hubster. I told him that there wasn't a college degree nor certifications for what the hubster did for a living. He was extremely opposed to hitting women and would never raise a hand to me. He was devistated that his wife divorced him. His ex wanted to have an open marriage and since he wouldn't agree to it, she kicked him to the curb. The welfare thing affected him so much, that he hated my clipping coupons...I got him over that! LOL Plus, when he saw how much the hubster was making, which more than my dad, and all of the hubster's finances, he saw that his little girl was going to be okay.    \n\n\nHowever, my mom didn't get the memo. Dad told her his change of heart. She still wouldn't step back. As the hubster and I had kids, she'd tell the kids not to be like their father or would put down his side of the family. I'd run to dad, he'd reign her in. Then my dad unexpectedly died. She continued to be mean to the hubster. I showed her that for most of our marriage, he had three jobs at one time - his job, freelance weekends, and book editor. He didn't smoke, drink, do drugs, didn't gamble, no hobbies like golf or hanging out with the boys. He didn't hit on other women...or men. \\*eye roll\\* We're nowhere close to being on welfare or homeless. We agree on everything financially, politically, and religiously. He's my calm. He's a godly man, never raised his hand to me, is my best friend in the whole wide world, is there for our kids and their biggest sports fan and booster, and there FOR them whenever they need him and most importantly...he's MY husband and not hers, so she gets no voice.   \n\n\nTo the day she died, she was mean to him AND a few years before she died she started being mean to our kids. It would've devistated me had it been the other way around, but the hubster didn't let it phase him at all. He only cared what \\*\\*\\*I\\*\\*\\* thought of him because we both knew the truth. He still doesn't care. I still apologize for her extremely embarrassing actions. We are still set on a solid course to the Golden Anniversary!  :-)  \n\n\nSo, GOOD FOR YOU! Love the advice to meet up with the wife and sisters alone. Fantastic idea to give them a vacation from Ole Brutus the Tyrant.  Advice to the wife and sisters...GROW A SPINE! Ignore the dad's childish rants and ravings. A REAL man doesn't act like that. If he refuses to act like an adult or shed his \"DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM??\" complex, he can just sit on his high and mighty throne...alone and lord over his kingdom of one...his wife.

Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.\n\nThey invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.\n\nI honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).\n\nAfter arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.\n\nThis morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.\n\nMy wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pardon my long and speculative reflection here, and sorry if I'm totally reading this wrong. A domineering FIL like you have can leave a powerful long lasting impression on your wife, and what you had to endure for this episodic period is likely what she has has to exist within for decades. Men like this who act cool and calm when they are in control, turn angry and targetedly cruel when they even sniff that their role as \"king of the castle\" is challenged. Being questioned (usually by women or \"outsiders\") is not acceptable, and this feeling can be triggered by many even invisible/illogical slights. Order is also maintained by training veneration/obedience through statements about \"not complaining\", \"be grateful\", or expressing auto-dissaproval over any action/expressed thought that he hasn't vetted first. Your wife probably has specific memories throughout her life where she accidentally triggered a cruel response from her father. Enough times that she learned to reflexively obay FIL for her own emotional safety. I'm sure she loves you tremendously, and her dynamic with her father is a deep form of abuse even if he never raised a hand to her. She may seem normally strong and independent, then suddenly submissive and uncertain when FIL is present or if his voice enters her thoughts. It may take a very long-term combination of therapy, limiting FIL contact, and loving patience on your part to help your wife recognize this as real abuse, learn what she needs to free herself of this, and actually actualize those practices in a consistent way. It's hard to be the person to jump in and reveal a cycle of emotional abuse, but I'm proud of you for both standing up for yourself, for communicating openly with your wife about your feelings of the situation, and for presenting a solution that allows you both to leave a clearly unhealthy household.",

It shouldn\u2019t be a need at all, but if her parents are insisting they both stay in the home but not in the same room with no guest room while husband has a bad back, why would that not be the wife\u2019s first thought to a solution, NOT that the husband just has to deal with it to appease HER parents ridiculous rules.
