She has done some over the top shit, like sell her beloved truck to lease a way over priced sports car so he could drive it and play music so loud it made the whole car buzz. I've seen her be a hippie, a goth, a mechanic, a hip hop girl and now a backwoods barbie. Its exhausting and to be honest I don't think its that fun for her either.

This guy is 100% right she needs her own identity, there's a difference between trying out what your partner likes and hard core committing to it instantly, like trying to buy a cobra or spending 2.5k on a hobby you never enjoyed before. If she was a healthy individual she would have her own hobbies that persist no matter what her boyfriend likes, she would try and play on her boy friend's rig for awhile before deciding to drop a huge investment into something she'd never liked before, she'd read up and REALLY decide whether or not she wants a fucking cobra before she buys one taking into account whether or not she actually likes the animal and wants to take care of something so dangerous especially if she broke up with her boyfriend, like she should try having a normal small completely harmless snake before deciding she wants to try with a cobra.. . She'd try cooking for a week or so with small dishes and use her ex boy friends supplies instead of going out and buying everything herself, she'd learn from her boyfriend basic beginner moves and see him perform before deciding to go join a fucking class. And on top of that she's literally never stuck with any of the hobbies nor does she have a hobby that persists regardless of what her boyfriend's into. This girl has mental issues, she needs her own identity and for the love of GOD she seems to have huge impulsivity issues with *over committing* before she has any idea if she actually likes them or not. You're supposed to take baby steps that don't have a large financial or time commitment to decide whether or not this seems interesting to you and especially not something that could be dangerous to your health without even knowing if you like snakes, especially deadly snakes.\n\nI don't get why ANYONE in their right mind is saying YTA, this girl has issues.",

My self-worth (& now that of my 16 & 19 year old daughters) is tied to my own accomplishments. It's the most freeing thing.\n\nWhen I looked at my former sister-in-law (I'm a widow) who very much was raised to have her worth tied to her man, I realized how bloody exhausting that would be. I'm entirely sex positive when the person is an adult & I don't say this to slut shame but to explain. Her 200+ body count has not resulted in her happiness. She is a raging alcoholic. Every time the guy leaves, & he inevitably does because her personality is his personality so there isn't anything she brings to the table that he doesn't already have, she bottoms out & feels worthless. She is 3 years older than I am so that makes her 43. She settles for abusive assholes because the point is to attract a guy & nobody ever said anything about it needing to be a good guy. She won't wait for a good guy because, without any guy, she feels absolutely worthless. It's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Luckily my husband & I have been a huge part of my nieces (& nephew) lives so there is a good chance they won't choose a similar path or, if they do, it might be one they can find a way out of. \n\nI really wish more girls were raised as I was because my ex was an extraordinary guy, my late husband was an extraordinary guy & my boyfriend now is an extraordinary guy too plus he's literally the sweetest guy ever. I could wait to really find someone who I absolutely gelled with & who would treat me as well as I treat them because my self-worth wasn't tied to having a guy & I'm perfectly fine & content by myself. That's the gift I want everyone to have, the gift I'm so immensely grateful I got & the gift I loved enough to make sure my daughters got it too & it didn't cost a thing.

And I appreciate being free to find out what I want in life. \n\nNow with the long distance dude I don't feel right about hanging out on bumble looking for dates or whatever.
