I have to ask though did they just send their kids to your place to swim without supervision? Beyond reckless and irresponsible parenting on their part if anything happened to their kids you could potentially be liable depending on the laws of your country. I know when my family had a pool put in when we were building our house my dad had to measure everything out for a fence, even though we were WAY back from anyone else&#39;s home and there was literally no chance or reason another person would be back there without reason, simply because of the sheer liability risk it posed if anyone did stumble across it and went for a swim. </p>\n\n<p>This is the smart play. You&#39;re entirely justified in this.</p>\n</div>",

I just came to say that I don\u2019t think the idea a lot of people are suggesting to let select kids into the field to play is practical. Unless you have nothing but time on your hands. Every time a child wants to be let into the field, there will be another knock on your door, and you\u2019ll be expected to go unlock the gate. These kids are not going to organize and all show up at the same time to all be let in at once. They\u2019ll trickle in one or a couple at a time. You\u2019ll be opening that gate to let someone in or out every hour. You\u2019ll have people knocking on the door when you\u2019re trying to sleep in, when you\u2019re sitting down to eat, when you\u2019re in the shower. Then you\u2019ll regret ever letting them in. \n\nAnd if you let the kids who were misbehaving in, to give them another chance, there\u2019s always the chance they might not have learned anything. They might try to destroy your property to retaliate. Their parents may take you letting them in as an invitation to start harassing you to let them in too. Now you\u2019re having to deal with these people again, after spending all that money on a fence to be rid of them. \n\nDo what you want, but I think it\u2019s best not to let anyone in.

Plus, short of sitting at the gate and policing, it would be very easy for the poorly behaved children to slip in, especially in big groups of football.

That is to say the field is bigger than what OP owns, and that for OP to wall off their property, they would have to cut the field into pieces. People are right though that pick up games can happen within a pitch of many varying dimensions.</p>\n</div>",

Cousin had a trampoline net that they secured with multiple industrial strength zip ties and luckily took pictures of it.  Neighbor's kid broke their arm while cousin was on vacation and neighbor sued.  Cousin found and took pictures of the CUT zip ties and gave them to his lawyer.  In court it comes out the neighbor told kid to he could jump on the trampoline and the kid had to climb the fence to get into the yard.  Kid came back telling dad about zip ties so dad went over and CUT THEM OFF.  When that came out the judge wasn't amused with the neighbor, awarded damages to cousin, dismissed neighbor's suit \"with prejudice\" (lawsuit for that incident can never be refiled) and officially trespassed neighbor from cousin's yard.
