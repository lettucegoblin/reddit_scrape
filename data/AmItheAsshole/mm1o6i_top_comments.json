I was always anxious that people could see me from the outside. However, I tested it myself and found out that during the day, when it\u2019s bright outside, you couldn\u2019t see the inside of my unit very well... just blurry silhouettes (unless something was right up against the window) the only time you could see from the outside was at night and I had lights turned on inside with the blinds open. That combined with the fact you were able to take pictures of him \u201ccreeping\u201d multiple times makes me believe he may have just been spacing off in that direction with no idea you were there and this may be a case of an innocent misunderstanding.

I ask because I used to live in an apartment on the first floor where my unit was right next to the front office and there were lots of foot traffic in front of my windows. I was always anxious that people could see me from the outside. However, I tested it myself and found out that during the day, when it\u2019s bright outside, you couldn\u2019t see the inside of my unit very well... just blurry silhouettes (unless something was right up against the window) the only time you could see from the outside was at night and I had lights turned on inside with the blinds open. That combined with the fact you were able to take pictures of him \u201ccreeping\u201d multiple times makes me believe he may have just been spacing off in that direction with no idea you were there and this may be a case of an innocent misunderstanding. I definitely believe privacy is important but if this is the case, having a mirror reflecting light on someone\u2019s house is an inconvenience that might make you an unintentional AH.</p>\n</div>",

However, as other users have pointed out, it\u2019s easy to accidentally stare into someone else\u2019s window if you\u2019re just outside waking around. \n\nI walk my dog around the neighborhood every day, and I\u2019m sure that while I\u2019m waiting for him to take a dump, I\u2019ve stood facing the general direction of someone\u2019s house. I don\u2019t think I seem like a creep, but I\u2019ve definitely cringed inside when accidentally making eye contact with someone through their window. \n\nNot to say you\u2019re not correct that he was leering at you, just that there\u2019s some deniability on their part... and there\u2019s a solid chance that it\u2019s not malicious. The appropriate first step is to talk to the people involved. Strap a mask on, walk 100 ft, and say hi. \n\nBut you skipped over that, and that makes you an Asshole too - especially as you admit that your solution is ugly, and inconveniences others, and there are better solutions out there. And when you\u2019re going that far, and ignoring their concerns (even though you have the ability to address them), then that\u2019s being an asshole neighbor.

However, as other users have pointed out, it\u2019s easy to accidentally stare into someone else\u2019s window if you\u2019re just outside waking around. </p>\n\n<p>I walk my dog around the neighborhood every day, and I\u2019m sure that while I\u2019m waiting for him to take a dump, I\u2019ve stood facing the general direction of someone\u2019s house. I don\u2019t think I seem like a creep, but I\u2019ve definitely cringed inside when accidentally making eye contact with someone through their window. </p>\n\n<p>Not to say you\u2019re not correct that he was leering at you, just that there\u2019s some deniability on their part... and there\u2019s a solid chance that it\u2019s not malicious. The appropriate first step is to talk to the people involved. Strap a mask on, walk 100 ft, and say hi. </p>\n\n<p>But you skipped over that, and that makes you an Asshole too - especially as you admit that your solution is ugly, and inconveniences others, and there are better solutions out there. And when you\u2019re going that far, and ignoring their concerns (even though you have the ability to address them), then that\u2019s being an asshole neighbor. I wouldn\u2019t ask them for a cup of sugar, or to watch your place while you\u2019re out of town. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr he shouldn\u2019t be looking, but you went nuclear and are impacting not just the alleged creep, but also his family members who have never done anything to you.</p>\n</div>",

Something similar happened to my parents; they have a mirrored wardrobe that faces the window and when my dad was cleaning the glass one day he noticed one of the neighbours on a stepladder looking into his room and when my mum noticed she went absolutely mental, so in retaliation my dad decided to grab my mum, throw her onto the bed and climb on top of her. Needless to say the woman was never caught looking in again, she also fell off the stepladder in shock. So yeah if you ever want a way to stop the mirror complaints I\u2019d say something like this would probably work but be wary in case your neighbours really take offence or something if you don\u2019t want to cause any issues with them.

Even sometimes I'll look up and see him, look away then look back minutes later and he's still looking. So I started shutting the shades during the day but that was kind of annoying, my place is a  dark cramped shoebox without the windows open.

The wife was complaining about the windows for a lot of reasons... \n\n1. They were ugly\n\n2. It was uncomfortable, especially for the teens and their friends, to have a huge mirror adjacent to the swimming pool. It's at a time that they feel insecure about looks and they have lost interest in hanging out by the pool.\n3. In the afternoon and evening, it was reflecting a lot of extra sunlight into their backyard, they couldn't enjoy eating dinner on the back porch with the sun in their eyes.\n\nI said sorry about the inconvenience but I wanted it for privacy. \n\nThey both pushed back on that some and I said that I needed privacy because of the husband's starting.\n\nHe started denying it in front of his wife and so I took out my phone where I'd taken pictures and sent it to my group of friends, and showed her a couple pictires of him gaping at my apartment and the texts from that time.\n\nHe got mad and said he incidentally looked over, and the 8 foot by 20 foot mirror was a crazy overreaction.\n\nI said that I'd like to keep it, and that I was sorry but frankly this was avoidable. \n\nI think they're both mad because they called my landlord, who brushed them off \n\nAITA for putting the mirrored film on my windows?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We have a pool, and enjoy eating in our backyard.  The mirror makes the kids uneasy swimming, and is blinding during a good part of the day meaning we can't use our yard.  We went over to talk to them about the issue, like adults,(something that you never bothered with OP) and she accused my husband of peeping.  We were confused by the accusation and tried to explain that sometimes husband is lost in thought, and maybe it seemed like he was staring.  She then showed us pictures that she took from inside her apt, of my husband in the back yard!  She continued to accuse my husband of things and refused to listen to us.  I have a couple kids in their teens, and they like having friends over to swim.

Who the heck doesn't know what a person taking a picture looks like??  As long as we're assuming, wouldn't the more logical assumption be that he could not see you taking pictures?  Did you ever think to try waving at him?  Now my turn for assumptions, maybe your windows are just nice to look at?  Maybe they reflect the pool water and make some nice patterns - something easy to get lost in thought on.  I have a south facing wall of windows myself, and can absolutely say you cannot see inside more than a foot or two during the day from 10ft distance.  Unless the window room also has a second wall of windows opposite the one in question, even IF he was staring in your house, he would not be able to see much of anything aside from plants directly in front of the windows.
