He had a 6 year old son and if I didn't pay for food there would be none when his son visited on the weekends.  I took his kid to the movies and the park and generally did all the things a parent should do.  He seemed really nice on the outside, but when you brushed past the surface it was clear that due to the choices he made he was lazy and incredibly selfish.  His father was the exact same way.  During his \"career\" his father had been a policeman, city design planner, fisherman, carpenter, and musician.  He was never employed for long and had long years of unemployment.  His poor mother basically carried the family in a social services job for 30 years.  The kicker was when her mother died and she got an inheritance, my boyfriend's dad convinced her to spend it all paying for his medical bills from a heart attack a few years back, and investing in an at-home recording studio.

I can understand that things can change in a marriage at times where one person loses their job or can't work due to a medical reason and you both work through it and 'support' each other as you work through it, but it appears that your ex had no interest or intention of working which puts a lot of pressure and stress on you.\n\nI know people like this who can't or don't want to hold a job and it never ends well and for those that stay together, it's a lifetime of carrying the financial burden.

Because now gf and daughter is dependent on the state and due to the nature of their disabilities, they were separated into different care facilities.

I have a few friends who didn\u2019t do what you did and now they are retired with an abusive spouse. My other suggestion to make sure your beneficiaries are changed especially at your work.  I worked in HR and remembered one of my employees died at home (he didn\u2019t take care of himself). He was devoted and took care of his disabled wife and daughter (also disabled) by driving them to all their dr appointment and such.  After his death, his family learned he never bothered to divorce his first wife and change the beneficiary portion.  First wife got everything including pension, social security, life insurance payout (employer provided).  Because now gf and daughter is dependent on the state and due to the nature of their disabilities, they were separated into different care facilities.  From what I understand, they were never able to visit or physically with each other again.<br/>\nI know your life will soar and be good. Don\u2019t give up!</p>\n</div>",

You should be more or less on the same page. For my husband and I, saving money for retirement was super important. That goal guides our spending on everything. However, if you\u2019re more of a \u201cenjoy the money while you\u2019re young\u201d kind of person, make sure they\u2019re on the same page. Otherwise, you may need to work out a compromise (the fun money policy helps with this, see below)\n\n- Have a \u201cfun money\u201d policy. Whether you\u2019re living at or well below your means, decide how much money to set aside for fun things each month. I highly recommend having separate fun money funds for each of you. This is money you can spend on whatever you want without checking with your spouse. You can either budget for a certain dollar amount or do what my husband and I do: any \u201cextra money\u201d outside of our normal salary (bonuses, side gigs, proceeds from selling old stuff) is our fun money. So if I babysit for friends, that\u2019s my money. If he gets a bonus at work, that\u2019s his. It incentivized both of us to work and save up for the things we want and takes out any questions of fairness. \n\n- Have a budget. Outside of fun money, your remaining salary should go to necessary expenses and savings. That\u2019s why the fun money policy is so important - it keeps unnecessary expenses in check. \n\n- Expect each other to follow the budget, and consult each other if you need to spend outside the budget (again- fun money is no questions asked!)\n\n- If you choose to keep separate bank accounts, consider carefully who pays which expenses. This can be an even split, or based on who makes more money. Remember, if one person feels a heavier burden, or the distribution of expenses leaves one person with consistently more \u201cfun money\u201d than the other, this can lead to resentment.\n\n- If either partner is not following the guidelines you\u2019ve set for yourselves, talk it out. Don\u2019t let it fester. Discuss whether the guidelines need to change and how you can keep things fair while also meeting financial goals.",

She's got a restraining order, she's got a record of harassment, they'll ask him why he's not working, they'll ask him why, when he does, he under earns and then blows through his cash, they may even ask about that fancy computer rig he paid for with her bonus and then ran off with. They'll ask a whole lot of cool questions like that and then split the assets, which now includes his gaming rig.\n\nAnd I can promise you this much, it's a lot cheaper to divorce now than it is to continue supporting a spouse who won't get a job.",

Household labor doesn't have to be split 50/50, in a childless relationship, and it certainly doesn't have to be 100/0 in instances where only one person is bringing in the money, but there should be enough of an effort that both people in the relationship feel like they are equals. Otherwise, there is either a complete lack of recognition about the efforts each of them puts forth to make their home, or someone is assuredly taking advantage of the other, and neither is likely to make the marriage last.",

I am successful now and deem him not worthy and basically calling me an elitist. Some of them even said I would end up with a guy who left me for his secretary. I truly felt guilty.\n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty for. The people who are saying that are manipulated by your ex. Everyone on here can see the truth. He is not \"down on his luck\" he is using you. I bet that every married couple on here is horrified at the idea that big purchases would be made without prior discussion, especially big purchases that only benefit one person rather than the couple.  \n \nUntil recently I've been unemployed and supported by my husband. I've tried to do most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, washing etc (although he still helps because he is a good person!). I also apply for jobs most days and have been working on a course that could lead to some income. And even then I feel bad asking for money for things I don't strictly need. I'd never just assume I could make a big purchase. And if my husband got a bonus I'd let him decide how it was spent. My husband wants me to be happy and randomly pops money in my account and says to go out for lunch with a friend, and recently bought me a dress as a surprise. He is generous. But he would be pissed off if he found out I just took his card and made a big purchase for myself without discussion.  \n \nYour ex is also not telling anyone that he is emotionally abusive. Putting you down. Making you feel worthless. Saying he owns you and taking credit for your success. None of that is healthy or normal.  \n \nListen to the people on here, not the people who have believed his \"woe is me\" version of events and his lies. Their opinions do not matter. You did not ruin this marriage- you supported him for years and got disrespect in return. You're SO much better off without him.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>This is very true. I kept getting messages about how could I be so cruel to kick my husband to his parents when he is down on his luck.

I&#39;ve tried to do most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, washing etc (although he still helps because he is a good person!).
