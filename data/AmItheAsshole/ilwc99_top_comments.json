He literally let her alienate you and your family from the rest of the group, treated you all like crap and gave you no say in an event that was *supposed* to be about you and your fianc\u00e9. Also gaslighting you into making you feel like you weren't allowed to have a *rational* and understandable reaction to being treated like shit by your future family. He sounds like a horrible person. \n\nPlease. *PLEASE* see that what he is doing is in NO WAY OKAY and get out of there. Cut your losses, give him back the ring, stay with your parents, TELL EVERYONE EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS DONE and get away from the whole toxic family before its too late and you can't escape without a divorce. \n\nYou deserve so much better. I'm so sorry.",

I flew to the east coast and \u201cmet the family\u201d for the first time. Over the initial dinner the whole evening unraveled, and I found myself literally fending off verbal assaults from every one of her siblings and then her. It was such an onslaught that her parents got up and left the table immediately after dinner, and I left and went to bed early. \n\nI was trapped in the house for a full week (over the holidays) and no resolution came of the situation. My girlfriend didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and basically abandoned me to spend 98% of her time with her family; never checking on me, rarely inviting me into conversations, etc...\n\nLong story short, it was such a deep wounding of my trust and safety with her that I never came back around to loving her. I tried multiple times to have resolution, but she never wanted to face it, let alone apologize even in the slightest. Ultimately it lead to the end of our relationship 6 months later. \n\nI hope that if this is the man you want to marry that you find a way to work this out and heal the situation. What ever you do, stand true to who you are and do not let people disrespect you. If you do it will become the norm and snowball out of control. Stand up for yourself, be gracious and forgiving, and above all be true to your own feelings.",

        "body": "INFO\n\nOk, please hear me out. I think reddit often only offers one cultural point of view, or without a cultural context judges others based on their own cultural point of view. \n\nOne question, are you or fiance of Asian, Indian, middle eastern? Because this may influence a few things...\n\n1.) A Western \"Engagement Party\" is to celebrate the couple about to be wed. In some Eastern cultures \"Engagement Party\" is a celebration of family, a celebration of a son or daughter to be wed. For example, my SIL had a western style Engagement Party. She and her friends organized it, had a party focused on her, with her themes, etc. Shortly after, my mother held a \"Engagement Party\" for my brother. Of course my SIL and her parents were invited, but the main attendance was my mother's friends and family. It's not a big deal, but I guess in Western standards it'd be considered a type of engagement party. My SIL's parents also had a separate \"engagement party\" for their daughter. In this context the focus isn't always on the bride, it's the focus on the son or daughter growing up, finding someone to love, etc. Etc.\n\n2.) I believe the money issue is concerning and even though I disagree with this tradition in most cases..... What is the full context here? Did your fiance give up what was essentially 100% his own savings? Or was it \"gift money.\" For example, my brother was gifted tens of thousands of dollars from parents and grandparents before and after the wedding. Some was as a wedding gift, some to add as down payment for his first home. Was the savings your fiance gave up just a small portion of money received from parents over the years? Expensive is relative. I.e. is money only flowing one way in this family or is it a two way street? \n\n3.) Ok, I think the whole \"I need to sit in the passenger seat because he's my fiance\" is a little bit selfish. I don't know why Westerners make such a big deal about who sits in the passenger seat, it's as if it's the queens throne or something. Maybe they just wanted to talk up front? Maybe your future MIL is old and gets uncomfortable sitting in the back with kids. Maybe she just wants to spend some time with her son since you'll be spending the rest of your life with him? In my own context... Sometimes my mother sits up front, sometimes my girlfriend does, and same with my brother and SIL. Going to the beach with the dogs? Gf sits in the back since we want my mother to be comfortable without dogs stepping on her. Middle of conversation? Mom sits in the front while SIL   sits in the back, and vice versa. I don't think this is some case of \"respect your elders\" or \"filial piety.\" Honestly we're all adults and we are (or will be family) and we're fighting over who sits in a passenger seat....? The context is important.\n\nThe other people telling you \"RED FLAGS RED FLAGS RED FLAGS\" are blowing this way out of proportion and focusing too much on one point of view.",

For instance a long distance period, a new job, the death of a family member or all sorts else. So if you leave at the first sign of trouble, then you will inevitably leave all relationships you're a part of (almost certainly). \n\nSo to me, it is about balance - if you're with someone for 6 months, and then the following 6 months are awful for one reason or another, should you consider leaving? Certainly. However - if you've been with someone for a few years or more and then you go through a rought patch of a month or two, surely the right thing to do (if you have, or have *had* very strong feelings and love for that person) is to try and work through your problems, and then only leave if they truly are unfixable. Even if it doesn't work out, that process is not a waste - you make instinctively sure to eachother that it reached an organic end, you learn about yourself in the process and you can walk away saying you tried your best. I think that's actually a beautiful thing. \n\nThis video vaguely touches on some themes which I think are also relevant.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4FLeY6F9g&feature=share",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The counter to that is that all relationships, even the <em>best possible relationship for you</em> can be rocked by unforseen events. For instance a long distance period, a new job, the death of a family member or all sorts else. So if you leave at the first sign of trouble, then you will inevitably leave all relationships you&#39;re a part of (almost certainly). </p>\n\n<p>So to me, it is about balance - if you&#39;re with someone for 6 months, and then the following 6 months are awful for one reason or another, should you consider leaving? Certainly. However - if you&#39;ve been with someone for a few years or more and then you go through a rought patch of a month or two, surely the right thing to do (if you have, or have <em>had</em> very strong feelings and love for that person) is to try and work through your problems, and then only leave if they truly are unfixable. Even if it doesn&#39;t work out, that process is not a waste - you make instinctively sure to eachother that it reached an organic end, you learn about yourself in the process and you can walk away saying you tried your best. I think that&#39;s actually a beautiful thing. </p>\n\n<p>This video vaguely touches on some themes which I think are also relevant.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4FLeY6F9g&amp;feature=share\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4FLeY6F9g&amp;feature=share</a></p>\n</div>",
