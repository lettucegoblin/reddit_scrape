Someone suggested when I go to school talk to my emergency dean and I am so grateful for you! With the police report I was able to get my school to pay for my semester again to that person thank you thank you thank you. I started a week late but a week late is better then not going. Sadly the harassment continued and escalated and due to what almost happened and all the text and calls I was able to get a temporary restraining order on his mom which she quickly violated smh. After a few weeks I was able to get a little bit over $8k back from my money and his brother did pay the remaining back to me (don\u2019t worry everyone we didn\u2019t meet it was through a third party). Also like most of you said depending on the state you can\u2019t drop charges after the fact so I couldn\u2019t do anything after the money was given back at this point it\u2019s up the court what happens. We haven\u2019t spoken nor do I care to. I\u2019m finally moving in a month which is a huge stress reliever because they won\u2019t know where I live anymore, a police report helps with a lot of things I got to break my lease thank God! Also won\u2019t keep my money home anymore. Thankfully since this is my last semester I won\u2019t have to work my bar jobs anymore so no more money in my closet. I think that\u2019s all I have to update you all on. Again thank you so much to all of you for your encouraging words and advice it meant a lot helped more then you can imagine.",

I\u2019m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I\u2019ve never been able to get a loan I\u2019ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I\u2019ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I\u2019m there or when I\u2019m not. Since I\u2019ve been saving for this semester he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s been over I\u2019ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it\u2019s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn\u2019t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn\u2019t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I\u2019m yelling at him about my money he\u2019s acting all confused and like I\u2019m crazy. He comes over I\u2019m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he\u2019ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it\u2019s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They\u2019ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it\u2019s stressing me out even more and I hate that I\u2019m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I\u2019ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they\u2019ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don\u2019t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don\u2019t know what to do and I hate that I\u2019m contemplating doing this. I\u2019m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I\u2019ve never been able to get a loan I\u2019ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I\u2019ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I\u2019m there or when I\u2019m not. Since I\u2019ve been saving for this semester he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s been over I\u2019ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it\u2019s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn\u2019t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn\u2019t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I\u2019m yelling at him about my money he\u2019s acting all confused and like I\u2019m crazy.

(Hint: this story is either an outright lie or a major exaggeration.)\n\nThere's major issues with this story, and why if their BF did this he wouldn't actually have been arrested. \n\nFirst off, he stole cash. In order to get an arrest warrant for this, they would have to have evidence that: 1) The cash actually existed in the first place 2) The amount of money is correct 3) that he actually stole it\n\nThey dont have to prove these things to get an arrest, but there would have to be actual evidence of it other than a claim that he admit it, that only they heard, and an ampunt that only they know. Without sufficient evidence of all of those things, there can't be actual charges filed. The police would simply say to take him to court over it.\n\nIf this was a bank account with a paper or electronic trail, the story would be plausible. But a box of cash is almost impossible to prove was there to be stolen in the first place. \n\nAs it stands, from OP's own story: this is a box of cash that only they knew about, and it was stolen by someone who admit it to them alone. You can't even get a search warrant based on that, let alone an arrest. When you're claiming that someone stole that much money, you have to prove that it happened since that is a felony charge. \n\nAnother major hole here is that this supposedly happened yesterday. I'm not sure how many people here have ever actually dealt with courts or the police, but unless it's an emergency or a violent crime, this would never be processed that fast. Hell, they likely wouldn't even find him that fast even if there was a warrant issued. Do you really think the police are going to canvas the area for someone who stole cash from someone's house? No, they aren't. In cases like these, he would only get found if he got pulled over for speeding or something. Unless someone who knew about the situation saw him and called. Even then, in the vast majority of cases, by the time the police arrived he would have left. The police aren't exactly going to pop their sirens on to get to a location asap over an arrest warrant for (even felony) theft. Again, it's not an emergency so things do not move this fast.\n\nBack to the cash and the evidence. If questioned by the police, he could simply say they're lying about everything. He could say they accused him and that he never said he took it. He could say they gave it to him as a gift, and then they got in a fight, then wanted it back. (You're under no obligation to ever return a gift) He can say all sorts of shit to get out of this unless there's actual evidence to the contrary. Unless he straight up told police: \"yep, the box had that much money and I stole it\" he's not getting arrested for this. It would just be he said / she said, and that wouldn't result in an arrest warrant. \n\nIn the end, for an arrest to ever be made for theft, especially for an amount that results I'm felony charges being filed, there is a burden of proof that must be met. So unless OP has video evidence of it happening, or witnesses that heard him admit to doing it (even that is shaky) then the police couldn't get a warrant for an arrest at all. They would basically have to advise them to sue for the stolen amount and let the courts decide.\n\nIf he violently stole it, it would be a different story since there would be physical evidence of that. But stealing cash from a box? The police wouldn't take a second glance at that until there's more evidence than: \"The box had 14k in it, Im the only one who knew about it, but he stole it, and even admit it! Im the only person who can even attest to any of this and have no witnesses, but it is true I promise!\"\n\nThe police and court systems can be corrupt and fuck up a lot, but not to this level. If someone was actually arrested on those grounds, that person's suing the state instantly. Without probable cause, evidence of the crime being commit, or any collaboration of her story from even a single witness, that's a viciously bad wrongful arrest suit.",

Say you can demonstrate you tip out 15% of your tips each night to barbacks, bussers and kitchen. Your CPA is able to use that 15% deduction on your total taxable income. The higher your declared tips, the greater that 15% is when calculating that deduction.

Having a record of greater income is so so SO important for things like rental applications, credit card applications, loan applications for buying homes. And unemployment.
