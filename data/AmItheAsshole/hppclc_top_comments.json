Your sister, instead of being supportive, was trying to make sure your identity was a dirty little secret to hide from the in laws. She caused the drama in the first place, not you, not your father, she did. Apparently all she cared about was making sure her &quot;image&quot; wasn&#39;t tarnished in front of her in laws and would rather you sacrifice feeling comfortable at a party then to support you. If her in laws didn&#39;t like it, she could have told them to get over it. </p>\n\n<p>You shouldn&#39;t be asked to hide your identity. Period. End of discussion.</p>\n</div>",

An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. \n\nMy parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too.

You&#39;d think that this far into your transition, people who accepted you wouldn&#39;t bat an eye. I think this is a chance to be an eye-opener for how your sister really feels possibly - but this is just my own thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s amazing that your parents told her off and is absolutely wonderful. I had a dream lately that I had top surgery and went to a pool and was told to put a shirt on. So that&#39;s something I do think about and is on my mind. Is this something we trans folk need to think about?  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>YNA, and I think that&#39;s evident seeing how your parents responded. I&#39;m proud you stood your ground and think it shows great strength! I&#39;m about to have my first call to start medically transitioning in 5 minutes so this really hit me and I&#39;m grateful you shared the story. </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck!</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "NTA. Whilst I don't know if I'd deem your sister as transphobic - especially since she's been cool with it up until her in-laws were part of the picture - it's definitely not a cool thing for your sister to push for you to hide who you are just to make other folk happy. It's difficult to say whether this could be avoided without knowing the political stance of her in-laws; If they swing left then they'd probably be cool with it, but if they swing right then they might feel uncomfortable. It also depends if they know you're trans, like would the MiL dramatically scream and faint all hollywood-movie-style if you walked out and she saw the scars? Or do they already know and are prepared to see scars?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say regardless of that information is that you are still *definitely* NTA. In your sisters attempts to make her in-laws feel comfortable so they would stay, she pushed you to be uncomfortable and want to leave. If making you comfortable and wanting to stay would make her in-laws uncomfortable and want to leave (for whatever personal or political reasons) then maybe she should've discussed it openly to both sides beforehand; \"Hey bro, my in-law fam is transphobic, you may not want to come but if you do then just be prepared\" and (if you are open with your trans and if they're not total right-wing, trans-hatin', gun-totin' folk) \"Hey in-law fam, my brother is trans, just a heads up\". There is nothing worse than being unprepared for a sudden push into discomfort, and this was a situation that everyone could've been prepared for. \n\nI'm glad your parents supported you and decided to leave early too, it shows they took this seriously and didn't simply sweep it aside for the sake of her in-laws. It's a sad but true reality that some folk are still upset about LGBTQ+ topics, and whilst I respect your sister for wanting to make her in-laws comfortable, it is completely unfair for her to make you uncomfortable, especially around your own family. She needs to understand that there are consequences for her choice to prioritise her in-laws comfort over yours, especially with such an important topic such as gender changes. I hope your sister is able to redeem your trust, and your parents, and create a safe environment where you and her in-laws can spend time together.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. Whilst I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d deem your sister as transphobic - especially since she&#39;s been cool with it up until her in-laws were part of the picture - it&#39;s definitely not a cool thing for your sister to push for you to hide who you are just to make other folk happy. It&#39;s difficult to say whether this could be avoided without knowing the political stance of her in-laws; If they swing left then they&#39;d probably be cool with it, but if they swing right then they might feel uncomfortable. It also depends if they know you&#39;re trans, like would the MiL dramatically scream and faint all hollywood-movie-style if you walked out and she saw the scars? Or do they already know and are prepared to see scars?</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m trying to say regardless of that information is that you are still <em>definitely</em> NTA. In your sisters attempts to make her in-laws feel comfortable so they would stay, she pushed you to be uncomfortable and want to leave. If making you comfortable and wanting to stay would make her in-laws uncomfortable and want to leave (for whatever personal or political reasons) then maybe she should&#39;ve discussed it openly to both sides beforehand; &quot;Hey bro, my in-law fam is transphobic, you may not want to come but if you do then just be prepared&quot; and (if you are open with your trans and if they&#39;re not total right-wing, trans-hatin&#39;, gun-totin&#39; folk) &quot;Hey in-law fam, my brother is trans, just a heads up&quot;. There is nothing worse than being unprepared for a sudden push into discomfort, and this was a situation that everyone could&#39;ve been prepared for. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m glad your parents supported you and decided to leave early too, it shows they took this seriously and didn&#39;t simply sweep it aside for the sake of her in-laws. It&#39;s a sad but true reality that some folk are still upset about LGBTQ+ topics, and whilst I respect your sister for wanting to make her in-laws comfortable, it is completely unfair for her to make you uncomfortable, especially around your own family. She needs to understand that there are consequences for her choice to prioritise her in-laws comfort over yours, especially with such an important topic such as gender changes. I hope your sister is able to redeem your trust, and your parents, and create a safe environment where you and her in-laws can spend time together.</p>\n</div>",
