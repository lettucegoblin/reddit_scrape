The second my current bf said to me he despises cheaters, I told him that I cheated on an ex (also when I was young and dumb) and that I regretted it. My boyfriend also didn&#39;t get mad because he&#39;s not a child getting mad at me over stuff that doesn&#39;t effect him that happened years ago.</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My girlfriend knows how 200% I am against cheating, because nearly every relationship I&#39;ve been in before her, I&#39;ve been cheated on.</p>\n\n<p>About a year into our relationship, she told me that she cheated before, on her ex-boyfriend of 5 years (she was like 15 or 16 when she did it). She cheated on him within the first couple months of their relationship but hasnt cheated since, and she hates the fact that she did it.</p>\n\n<p>If she didnt tell me until 9 years into our relationship, I would be a little upset that she didnt tell me sooner, but i wouldn&#39;t break it off because of it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if we were dating for years and she cheated on me at the beginning of our relationship, but didnt tell me about it and I found out about it, that&#39;s a different story.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s more of a respect type of thing, telling your SO that you cheated before and regret cheating. But even still, Hunter is acting irrationally here.</p>\n</div>",
