These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport.\n\nI'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything.\n\nI woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird and also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower.\n\nWhen he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls.\n\nReally, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind.

I\u2019m thin so this is not a weight loss thing. \n\nBecause I hate it, I\u2019ve found it needs to be a routine, and missing the routine once is often the start to missing it several times and then I need to find another way to get myself to do it.  I mean, right now I should be getting on my exercise bike but I recently downloaded Reddit and made the mistake of picking up my phone this AM instead of getting right on the bike\u2026\n\nI wonder if something like that is going on here, combined with some sort or anger management or narcissistic personality disorder that causes him to externalize the blame.",

But when I started pushing 40, the \u201cway I feel\u201d part changed - I now really need to do some exercise at least a few times a week or my mood starts getting messed up and my body feels bad. I\u2019m thin so this is not a weight loss thing. </p>\n\n<p>Because I hate it, I\u2019ve found it needs to be a routine, and missing the routine once is often the start to missing it several times and then I need to find another way to get myself to do it.
