I think more than anything, this says to me that your mom is in a highly defensive position. The default assumption here is that your girlfriend is racist, and everything she does is going to be interpreted through that lens. You're not likely to get an apology out of someone on the defensive, so TBH cutting her out until she apologizes just means you're cutting her out. It's not a solution to improving the relationship between your parents and your GF.\n\nI will say this though, you said that your GF's **mom** came from the Philippines, which I interpret to mean that your GF is American born. If she's American born she should be more sensitive to African-American racial stereotypes (I don't mean should as in she has to be, but should as in more likely to be) because conflicts like this do happen. I'm Filipino-American and I would definitely think twice about serving black people fried chicken? Like I wouldn't just spring fried chicken and watermelon on a black person and say \"everybody loves fried chicken and watermelon, y u so sensitive???\" I disagree that Filipinos live and breathe fried chicken as part of their ethnic heritage, it's not THAT popular there. Filipinos in the Philippines eat Filipino food, by and large.\n\nI don't think your GF was necessarily wrong or an AH for serving your family fried chicken, lol. Just... not the brightest idea? There are so many other things she could have cooked? If your GF is American born, I think the \"Fried chicken is popular in the Philippines\" thing is a really gossamer thin argument. Your parents are sensitive about racism, if your GF is not an oblivious airhead, she should try to be more sensitive because they are obviously easily triggered.",

I was in the hair care aisle minding my own business considering some curly hair products and got yelled at for appropriating black women&#39;s hair. Got accused of having a perm, curling it, wanting to &#39;be black&#39; - the whole works.
