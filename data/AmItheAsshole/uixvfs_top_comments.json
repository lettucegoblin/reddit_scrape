These are his favorite dishes, not yours, and it sounds as though you're more than open to the fact that it takes time and trial and error to get it right. \n\nBut he didn't do that, did he? Instead, he used words that he knew were hurtful to complain about the fact that the food isn't quite to his liking, as soon as he thought you were out of earshot. He COULD have told his father than you were still learning, and it wasn't quite right yet, and that he wanted to eat the flavors he preferred quickly while you were away so as not to hurt your feelings or have to explain. I think that may have been his intention, but it's not what he did, and he needs to own that and make up for it. \n\nIf he isn't happy with the trial-and-error process that comes with you learning new things, or willing to take on his very necessary part in it, then he needs to either let it go or take up a cookbook himself. You didn't do anything wrong and he's not right to make you feel as though you did just to save his own ego. He messed up, hopefully he makes it right.",

It was HIS job to find a polite way (and it&#39;s very important that it be done politely) to let you know if it wasn&#39;t being prepared or seasoned correctly, because how would you know? These are his favorite dishes, not yours, and it sounds as though you&#39;re more than open to the fact that it takes time and trial and error to get it right. </p>\n\n<p>But he didn&#39;t do that, did he? Instead, he used words that he knew were hurtful to complain about the fact that the food isn&#39;t quite to his liking, as soon as he thought you were out of earshot. He COULD have told his father than you were still learning, and it wasn&#39;t quite right yet, and that he wanted to eat the flavors he preferred quickly while you were away so as not to hurt your feelings or have to explain. I think that may have been his intention, but it&#39;s not what he did, and he needs to own that and make up for it. </p>\n\n<p>If he isn&#39;t happy with the trial-and-error process that comes with you learning new things, or willing to take on his very necessary part in it, then he needs to either let it go or take up a cookbook himself.

I did not know how to cook, clean, or do laundry until about a week before I was leaving home for college (my mom, who did all this for me, apparently believed I'd somehow magically learn it at some point and when I didn't she scrambled to teach me in a week).\n\nThen I went off to college and got a job working at a group home for disabled adults. As part of my job either I or one of the other staff needed to make dinner every night. Now fortunately for me I am very much a take charge kind of person in other areas. And since many of my co-workers were in the same boat (in terms of their cooking skills) as me, I eventually decided I would learn. Now I have to say, for several months the guys ate a whole lot of burned meals. But I persevered to the point that I realized I love to cook.\n\nMy (now) wife loves to tell the story of the first time I came over to her apartment, and while looking in her refrigerator, realized she had almost no food (literally just fish sticks, instant mashed potatoes and corn). Horrified, I ran out to the store, got her groceries, cooked several meals, and froze them so she'd have something nutritious to eat.\n\nNow I'm not saying all this to toot my own horn, I just think that, if I can learn, OP's husband can too. I just hope it doesn't take OP leaving for him to pull his head out of his ass. OP you are NTA. But show him this and tell him I said to get his shit together.

I too was raised to believe the ridiculous &quot;women&#39;s work vs. men&#39;s work&quot; divide. I did not know how to cook, clean, or do laundry until about a week before I was leaving home for college (my mom, who did all this for me, apparently believed I&#39;d somehow magically learn it at some point and when I didn&#39;t she scrambled to teach me in a week).</p>\n\n<p>Then I went off to college and got a job working at a group home for disabled adults. As part of my job either I or one of the other staff needed to make dinner every night. Now fortunately for me I am very much a take charge kind of person in other areas. And since many of my co-workers were in the same boat (in terms of their cooking skills) as me, I eventually decided I would learn. Now I have to say, for several months the guys ate a whole lot of burned meals. But I persevered to the point that I realized I love to cook.</p>\n\n<p>My (now) wife loves to tell the story of the first time I came over to her apartment, and while looking in her refrigerator, realized she had almost no food (literally just fish sticks, instant mashed potatoes and corn). Horrified, I ran out to the store, got her groceries, cooked several meals, and froze them so she&#39;d have something nutritious to eat.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m not saying all this to toot my own horn, I just think that, if I can learn, OP&#39;s husband can too. I just hope it doesn&#39;t take OP leaving for him to pull his head out of his ass. OP you are NTA. But show him this and tell him I said to get his shit together. (oh and PS if you want to share any recipes of your native dishes I would be honored to have them!)</p>\n</div>",

Screw him and screw his parents for not telling him off for insulting your cooking. \n\nMy brother and I were lock key kids from the time I was ~8 until we were no longer kids. Since I'm older (by about 3.5 years), it was my job to cook dinner for us in time for my brother to get to (insert seasonal sport here) practice and my various after school activities. Typical of the youngest sibling BS that goes on, my parents usually took my brother's side when we had arguments (he was only trying to get your goat, he doesn't believe he'll get a new car if he totals the used car you both share, he doesn't believe he doesn't need to get good grades to get into university because he's going to play football and wrestle when he gets into high school, etc). \n\nOne day, I was making dinner mostly for my brother. I didn't have any activities after school that day, so I was planning on eating a little later. I'm pulling out the pot I needed and Brother decided to tell me he hated eating my food because my cooking was terrible. Brother was about 13 at the time, so I put the pot away and told him I was never cooking for him again. He said he was going to call Dad and have him make me cook for him. I was sure Dad would side with Brother because that's what previous experience had taught me, but I was frustrated and wanted to try and plead my case before rolling over and cooking for him. So Brother, true to his word, calls Dad, puts him on speaker and says \"Raven says she's not cooking for me anymore.\" Dad says \"Give her the phone,\" in a voice that says I'm about to get torn into. I take the phone, and without any pleasantries, say, \"Dad, he said my cooking sucked.\" Dad said \"well Son, you screwed yourself. Looks like you're cooking for yourself.\" My dad wouldn't even bring him takeout to eat on the way to practice for at least a month after the incident.",

A few months in, I suffered a serious injury, and couldn't keep up with most of the chores until I healed. Cooking was one of the things that I could do, so my wife would set everything up for me, and let me do it. We never switched back after I recovered, and the first few years of me learning were kinda... tough.\n\nBut, my wife at least tried everything I cooked (and still does, when I try new recipes), and if it sucked, we'd just laugh it off, talk to figure out wtf I did wrong, and I'd do better next time. She never complained about my failed experiments to anyone, and she's never been an asshole about me learning to cook. Now, I'm a great cook, so it's a non-issue, except when I try new things that may or may not turn out okay the first time lol.\n\nOP's husband sucks a lot. If he doesn't like the food he needs to be a man and tell her, so they can figure out what makes her food so \"awful\" and she can improve those skills, or she can save her energy and he can cook for himself.",
