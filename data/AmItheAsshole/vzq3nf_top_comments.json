It's also not your responsibility as the minor in the household to \"improve\" your relationship with your stepmom who clearly resents you.\n\nIt's EXTREMELY unfortunate that you don't seem to get along with the spouse of either of your parents.\n\nI think you need to sit down and ask your dad why he has higher standards for you, a teenager than he does his wife, a full grown adult.   I'm a stepmom and I most certainly think it's my problem if my stepchild is hungry.   I also don't understand why he'd marry someone who is combative and not loving toward you.  You are part of him, and she supposedly loves him, so what gives?\n\nI'm not sure what I'd do in your shoes since either parent's home sounds horrible to be in at the moment.   Shame on your dad for failing to stand up for you though, when you needed it.  It was the perfect opportunity for him to tell her that she shouldn't expect you to do for other kids what she won't do for you.  The kids got fed, she ordered them a pizza.  There was no reason to punish you for not obeying someone who can't treat you properly.  She's got some twisted priorities to think feeding her sister's kids is her problem but feeding her stepson is not.\n\nI'm utterly appalled at your dad for allowing her to order you to buy your own food.   That's reasonable if you were an adult living in their home, but not as a minor living in their home.  I do think I might use her food anyways and ignore her insane position.

My Fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 8 yrs, and the first 9 months went great, and I decided to see how my daughter and him would get along. He knew that if they didn't we would part ways, and he accepted that. \n\nToday, she's been living with us for the past 4 yrs, and my Fianc\u00e9 and her have a great relationship! There's times they ditch me to go do things they enjoy that I am not too fond of. Lol Like going to the movie theater. They went together when Sonic 2 came out, they are both huge fans. So they made it a day for just the them and one of her best friends. They went out for sushi and then the movie. \n\nShe has special things she does with her stepmother as well, and my ex husband and I encourage her to have her own relationships with our Significant Other. Her steps are under no pressure to be her parents, as she does have a mother and father who do their best to communicate, raise her right, and be friendly with each other; for her sake. \n\nThey also have a voice when it comes to things concerning our daughter. My ex and I as her parents, know that we don't have all the answers, and sometimes another point of view can really help! \n\nThe way I see it, is people who marry someone and don't like their parnters kid(s), or someone who has kids marrying someone who doesn't (and doesn't get along with theirs) are selfish. They forget the golden rule of having a child. \"Your life is no longer yours alone.\" As a parent, I want the best for my kid. I want her to have more and better than I had growing up, I want her to have more options, more choices... And I had a wonderful and happy childhood. \nMaybe I had a great example growing up, as I have an older half-brother from my dad's first marriage when he was like 17. He met my mom during his divorce when he was 21. My mom loved my brother (and still does) just as much as she would if she had been his birth mother. My mother was from a divorced household, so I think she understood and commiserated with my brother because of this. \nIt also gave me a lot insight, so when I got divorced my only concern was my child, and I fought for 50/50.",
