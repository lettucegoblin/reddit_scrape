Also someone who you\u2019ve decided to share both life\u2019s struggles and life\u2019s rewards with. Not saying you\u2019ve made this commitment to this guy (you obviously haven\u2019t, which is okay), but if you ever get married that\u2019s basically the level of commitment you\u2019re gonna make. \n\nIn this situation it was initially *his* idea to get tickets; you would likely never have been involved if he didn\u2019t bring it to your attention. It was also *his* mistake to act selfishly by saying \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to split a car, I want it all!\u201d He fucked up there and lost out big, and really got what he deserved. Then, you went and bought a ticket without his knowledge. Kinda shady move but totally understandable.\n\nSo, how might a more mature relationship handle this? For one, financial risks and rewards like this should be thoroughly discussed in advance. I mean *thoroughly*. Both parties should be completely cognizant of variables, potential payout, and repercussions of investments. It should be said clearly by one or both parties: \u201cOkay ________, to be very clear, you are choosing not to invest in this with me because you don\u2019t want to split the possible rewards. I am telling you now that i am going to invest and if I win I will not share the rewards with you. Is everyone clear about all this?\u201d That sorta thing. \n\nSecond, in some cases you gotta pay out to those you love, partners and children especially. No I don\u2019t mean *split* the rewards of a huge win, I mean you gotta kick down or invest in a mutual fund or resource with your partner. Personally, if this happened to my wife and I, and I was the one who made money on an investment she originally informed me about, I would kick her down $10K or more just out of love, and invest a big chunk into something mutually beneficial. You might be different, but that\u2019s me. \n\nThis is a good practice run for you. Sadly it looks like this could destroy the relationship, either soon or in the future, if it\u2019s not somehow resolved. OP has every right *not* to share because BF opted out. If nothing is shared then BF is gonna resent OP forever, and it\u2019ll eat away from the inside until it\u2019s done. The big question is, is the relationship worth protecting and saving? Is 3% of an investment worth the price of your relationship? \n\nCongratulations on the Win, and I\u2019m sorry for your potential loss.",

Everyone here is saying it\u2019s your money and shit but I don\u2019t think many people are considering how mean it was to win something he really wanted then sell it in front of him. At the same time, you bought it, and it\u2019s your car, and no one should expect you to give it to him. Either way this relationship is pretty much tanked</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I\u2019m getting downvoted to hell cause you fuckers can\u2019t read. I\u2019m not saying she should give him the fucking car. No one would expect that, especially this early in the relationship. I\u2019m saying she was a bit of an ass entering the competition just so she could laugh in his face and sell it in front of him.</p>\n</div>",

For example, the National Humane Society is raffling off a $50,000 Jaguar, and the tickets are $100.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on where you are, you may be taxed on the value of the car, and unless you have $100,000+ in cash lying around, you definitely have to sell that thing ASAP and I doubt you&#39;re going to get $300,000 for it.</p>\n</div>",

A year later, it turns out he's been cheating on her, and has now gotten said 18 year old pregnant. My friend has had to move back in with her parents, doing a job she hates, 8k out of pocket with no car, no boyfriend (good riddance), and nothing to show for it.

I have some insight here if you are interested. \n\nMost likely a trip with a limo ride to the airport and presidential suite in a fancy hotel would not be taxed. The trip is already \"paid for,\" either via a donation to the org (x nights at our hotel from the hotel chain or someone is fronting the cost) or because the org is paying for the hotel rooms/limo. You would not be taxed on these trips on top of your donation. You can write off everything but the fair market value of the trip, so in your example, they write off $2k in taxes. They wouldn't pay for anything except for what was not included in the cost of the trip (so, if there was no airfare included, they'd still have to pay for their own airfare).\n\nWe're also really careful about what trips we put together based on research done by our auctioneer (who is PHENOMENAL), our auction chair (volunteer from community) and our director of development (head of the fundraising office). We talk to our big donors about what they might want to see at the auction, and we give them a heads up--this gives them a chance to think about if they want to take the boat to a private island or whatever crazy thing we manage to find. Sometimes trips are consignment--we pay the consignment company $x if we sell it for more than $y. There are pros and cons to consignment trips--pros are that the organization doesn't have to organize the trip/often there is concierge service for the winner, cons are that you majorly cut into how much money you raise. \n\nAlso... The trips are often pretty cool. Last year we auctioned off a trip where you got to stay in your own private castle in Normandy. It went for ~$30k.\n\nThe people who are buying these trips a) already know what big-ticket items are on the table, and b) are already planning to publically make a large financial gift. Some people know they're going to get super caught up in the bidding. Sometimes we're able to sell trips more than once. It's a very weird world. \n\nAaannnddd I wrote that whole thing and realized you were probably talking about raffles but now I've written this so whatever. Raffles are even more complicated and stupid. The tax laws around them are really bonkers. Especially for things like cars or boats or whatever. I used to work for a fundraising consultant and she had me do some research to convince one of her clients to NOT try and raffle off a car specifically because of what a pain it is.",

They wouldn&#39;t pay for anything except for what was not included in the cost of the trip (so, if there was no airfare included, they&#39;d still have to pay for their own airfare).</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re also really careful about what trips we put together based on research done by our auctioneer (who is PHENOMENAL), our auction chair (volunteer from community) and our director of development (head of the fundraising office). We talk to our big donors about what they might want to see at the auction, and we give them a heads up--this gives them a chance to think about if they want to take the boat to a private island or whatever crazy thing we manage to find. Sometimes trips are consignment--we pay the consignment company $x if we sell it for more than $y. There are pros and cons to consignment trips--pros are that the organization doesn&#39;t have to organize the trip/often there is concierge service for the winner, cons are that you majorly cut into how much money you raise. </p>\n\n<p>Also... The trips are often pretty cool. Last year we auctioned off a trip where you got to stay in your own private castle in Normandy. It went for ~$30k.</p>\n\n<p>The people who are buying these trips a) already know what big-ticket items are on the table, and b) are already planning to publically make a large financial gift. Some people know they&#39;re going to get super caught up in the bidding. Sometimes we&#39;re able to sell trips more than once. It&#39;s a very weird world. </p>\n\n<p>Aaannnddd I wrote that whole thing and realized you were probably talking about raffles but now I&#39;ve written this so whatever. Raffles are even more complicated and stupid. The tax laws around them are really bonkers. Especially for things like cars or boats or whatever. I used to work for a fundraising consultant and she had me do some research to convince one of her clients to NOT try and raffle off a car specifically because of what a pain it is.</p>\n</div>",
