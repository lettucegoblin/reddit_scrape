It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nThis issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fuck everyone, focus on your guitar, and just be patient because the truly ugly people are going to lead ugly lives. People get more mature and things that used to be made fun of become much cooler. Further, a lot of women think that scars can be really sexy, so I think once you're dealing with more mature people that won't be a big deal anymore. Try to stay positive, I know it's hard but it genuinely does get so much better. I dropped out of high school due to bullying and spent years abusing alcohol, thinking I deserved to be treated badly - today I can genuinely say that I am happy, know my self worth, and am surrounded by amazing people. Like I said, it will get better once you're around smarter, more mature people. ",

Karma is a bi**h, and this will bite her in the butt hard.  She deserved everything you did, and more.

It does not matter. High school will come and go and you\u2019ll see when you\u2019re an adult and out of high school, that all of that shit never mattered. I promise you. The real world is different. It is far bigger, and there are far more amazing, genuine people who will accept you for who you are and find you beautiful. High school is like a bubble.

It&#39;s not the instagram itself being judged, but the people who see her and vote for her because of what they see her do and, in this case, if they think she is being a positive role model.</li>\n<li>OP has already mentioned that they get bullied, feel ugly, etc. so one could assume they don&#39;t use social media like instagram, which is solely pictire based posts,  very often, if at all. Why would they open themselves up to more ridicule? You can&#39;t just assume someone must follow someone else on social media because they like them in person. My best friend doesn&#39;t even use facebook or instagram, so I can fully believe that OP doesn&#39;t follow her instagram.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
