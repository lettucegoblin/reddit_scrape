I mean you never came out and explicitly said it but we all know why your wife and in-laws think you and your daughter should stop cuddling.  Its because it looks like you two are...getting a little too comfortable?  If you know what I mean.  \n\nWhat they have failed to consider is the conversation you would have to have with your daughter to get her to stop.  I think it would go something like this:   \n\"Daddy why don't you want to cuddle anymore?\" \n\n\"Well sweety its because some daddies have sex with their daughters.  Fathers, and men in general, being disgusting creeps has become a thing in the current zeitgeist and so when your Grandparents and mother see the two of us cuddling they can't help but think that there's a chance I'm raping my own daughter.\"\n\n\"What?\". \n\n\"Yeah, I know.  To be fair though if you were to be molested it would most likely be by someone you know, maybe even a family member.  Wink wink.  Alright so you sit on that side of the room, I'll sit on this side and now the whole family can enjoy watching TV without having the mental image of me raping my daughter rolling around in their minds.  Anyone need a beer?\". \n\nI 100% do not think your the asshole for reacting the way you did.  The in-laws being weird is one thing, whatever everybody's got pain in the ass in-laws.

Except for (quick) hugs and some back/head pats, it mostly stopped once I was about 9 or 10 (I'm female). I know they love me, but it's just not their thing.\n\nMy husband grew up with a very affectionate mom and a not-at-all-affectionate (physically) dad. However, before we even got married, he said something that totally impacted me. We were talking about having kids, and he mentioned one of this best friends, Brian, and how Brian's dad always would give him these huge hugs and put his arm around him and stuff and how they always seemed to have a great relationship (this was when Brian was grown and out of the house, even). He said it was just clear how much Brian's dad loved him...not that husband's dad didn't also love HIM, but it was somehow different. He vowed to be a hugger as a father. We have three kids now and he cuddles the shit out of them and I absolutely love it.\n\nIt's weird for me sometimes. Not when they're super little, but as they grow. Like, my son who is now 8 occasionally still wants to hold my hand. I'm not used to this! I never held my mom or dad's hand at that age! However, I hold on, and even bend over and give him a little kiss on the cheek sometimes when I start thinking like this. Because I want to have a more affectionate family than the one I grew up in. I want my kids to think of me and my husband as safety and comfort, personified.\n\nI think the in-laws need to realize that not everybody's families are the same and not everybody's hangups are the same. There is literally NOTHING wrong with cuddling or hugging or holding hands with your child as long as both of you are cool with it. The in-laws (and the wife) need to chill.",

My girlfriend said they often have more kids in the classroom then they\u2019re supposed to have and always want them to cut corners. \n\nThey got more strict a couple years ago though because of an incident. They hired an elderly man who had been a teacher for like 40+ years. He just wanted some easy part time work. He was chubby, tall, had a long white beard so kids associated him with Santa and I guess some of them liked sitting on his lap like when he\u2019d read to them and stuff. A parent heard about it and FREAKED out. Posted all over Facebook, contacted the news and contacted the police as well. Of course that parent kept her kids enrolled there though, and just demanded they fire him. That\u2019s when they made the rule about men not being allowed around the kids alone and they usually make the men do outside physical work that needs done, cleaning, or random maintenance around the facility, which the women never have to do. \n\nMy girlfriend said nobody has a problem if the women hug the kids or if they sit on their laps though. She also said it was bullshit how the old guy got in so much trouble for it, she honestly didn\u2019t realize how careful guys have to be around kids until that happened.",

It is sad that whenever a male is involved, some people just instantly jump to the conclusion any affection is sexualized in some way.  \n\nI am a male preschool teacher and I have been for about 7 years now;  I have a small class that is a mix of typically developing children and those with others needs, whether it be on the spectrum or just sensory, behavioral, or aggression issues.  At least in my area, parents seem to enjoy the fact that their children get to have a male role model, especially considering most children don\u2019t have a male teacher until middle school.  I do have to do the physical stuff at my center too - because I\u2019m a man - but I also volunteer and enjoy helping out my coworkers and the administration so that everything runs properly.\n\nI do not allow my preschoolers to sit on my lap (I tell them I\u2019m not a chair) but when I work with the younger children (1-2 year olds), they like to sit on my legs when they are straight out or things like that; young toddlers want to be as close to you as possible and generally nobody cares.

If there are concerns, most rational people would come to both the teacher and administration to alleviate them (though it sounds like there is shitty administration there too).  It is sad that whenever a male is involved, some people just instantly jump to the conclusion any affection is sexualized in some way.  </p>\n\n<p>I am a male preschool teacher and I have been for about 7 years now;  I have a small class that is a mix of typically developing children and those with others needs, whether it be on the spectrum or just sensory, behavioral, or aggression issues.  At least in my area, parents seem to enjoy the fact that their children get to have a male role model, especially considering most children don\u2019t have a male teacher until middle school.  I do have to do the physical stuff at my center too - because I\u2019m a man - but I also volunteer and enjoy helping out my coworkers and the administration so that everything runs properly.</p>\n\n<p>I do not allow my preschoolers to sit on my lap (I tell them I\u2019m not a chair) but when I work with the younger children (1-2 year olds), they like to sit on my legs when they are straight out or things like that; young toddlers want to be as close to you as possible and generally nobody cares.  I\u2019m sorry for the long rant - it\u2019s something important to me. Tell your girlfriend to keep up the good work.</p>\n</div>",
