If it truly bothered him to that extent he could have quietly asked the stewardess for help and not upset you.

I was fortunate that this was a laceration, not blunt force trauma. Which means the damage is mostly superficial aside from a little nerve damage where I cannot wink my right eye and it actually stays open just a smidge while I sleep. Sorry to talk about myself before answering your question but I feel like this information is important.\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019re 100% NTA. You\u2019re following your doctors orders and the dad/child were being inconsiderate of your feelings. Your response was adequate.\n\nSecond, being known as a person with a big scar on your face isn\u2019t too bad. It\u2019s interesting how FEW people ask about it. Most are just too polite and choose to ignore it or keep their curiosity to themselves. Occasionally a person with a lot of compassion may ask, or an especially callous person may ask, but they are uncommon.\n\nIt\u2019s true I\u2019ve never known a life without this defining aspect of my appearance. Regardless of it I\u2019m a pretty solid public speaker, I\u2019ve taught classes related to my profession and presented many things to audiences of various sizes without a 2nd thought about my scar of how they might perceive me.\n\nFriendship, dating, love, and romance have not been struggles in my life. Your scar is just an addition to the person you already are. It makes you unique and interesting. Unless you made your living as a model, it\u2019s unlikely to change anything in your life. Anyone who recoils from you or doesn\u2019t appreciate your experience is very likely a person you\u2019d be better off never knowing anyhow, so in that way it could be a blessing.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in sharing pics of your scar or seeing how mine looks (and how yours may look in a few years) feel free to PM. There are not enough of us out there gracing the world with our battle worn yet beautiful mugs, so I\u2019d hate for us not to unite.",

I had a long cut the that started halfway down my forearm, it went all the way up to my elbow were it was larger and deeper.  \n\nWhen it was time for me to stop covering the wound I was already back at work. Now the female uniforms sleeve stopped just before the elbows but the male's stopped half way down the forearm. \n\nA few times some of the other girls complained that they thought I should cover up the wound. 'Suggesting' that it probably made customers uncomfortable (it didnt). One of them complained to management, which made my manager offer a male shirt. I refused and since she couldn't make me wear it, she didn't bring up the issue again. \n\nOne co-worker kept 'suggesting' to cover it up-at one point admitting she thought it was gross. I finally snapped and told her \"Well learn to deal with it. I'm not covering it! Its my damn body, and it's my damn scar. I don't care if you think it's gross.\"\n\nI'm sorry you had to deal with that man saying your scar is ugly. He is just one idiot who will never understand how beautiful you are. Also your friends are right that scar will make you look like a total badass!",

Now the female uniforms sleeve stopped just before the elbows but the male&#39;s stopped half way down the forearm. </p>\n\n<p>A few times some of the other girls complained that they thought I should cover up the wound. &#39;Suggesting&#39; that it probably made customers uncomfortable (it didnt). One of them complained to management, which made my manager offer a male shirt. I refused and since she couldn&#39;t make me wear it, she didn&#39;t bring up the issue again. </p>\n\n<p>One co-worker kept &#39;suggesting&#39; to cover it up-at one point admitting she thought it was gross. I finally snapped and told her &quot;Well learn to deal with it. I&#39;m not covering it! Its my damn body, and it&#39;s my damn scar. I don&#39;t care if you think it&#39;s gross.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry you had to deal with that man saying your scar is ugly. He is just one idiot who will never understand how beautiful you are. Also your friends are right that scar will make you look like a total badass!</p>\n</div>",

I hope you see this... my facial scarring isn't nearly as bad as what you described, but my injury occurred when I was 16, right before my junior prom - 6 fractures on the left side of my face. Needed reconstructive surgery, titanium plates, the works. \n\nWhen I got to the hospital, I was bawling. Blew my nose and under my eye puffed up beyond anything I can describe, and the triage staff's face just dropped. 3 of the fractures were in my cheekbone, effectively breaking my sinus cavity, so blowing my nose was a royal fuckup. It was bad - puffed up for months and bruised REALLY bad. Like a black eye, but worse.\n\nI dont remember much, but I do remember crying often and being upset that my face would be ugly forever. My mom tried to comfort me, my friends were amazing (similar with the whole \"look how badass you look\" and \"damn, fight club really messed you up\", and \"I bet the horse looks worse\"). It helped but I've always been really self conscious and not very confident in my looks, this definitely didnt help.\n\nIt's like 11 years later, and i do have a scars, one more visible than the rest, but overall I'm told it's not too noticeable, even though it's one of the first things I see when I look at myself. \n\nThe redness lightens up A LOT. But the muscle and nerve damage is pretty heavy. Massaging the scar helps so much to break down the stiffness of the scar tissue to help the cheek move more.. normally I guess. I have nerve damage and neuropathy from the injury as well as the surgery, as they had to go in through my mouth, in through the wound (the main scar), and 2 incisions under my eyelashes in order to place the titanium plates. \n\n I'm not sure how deep your wounds are, but make sure you massage the scar tissue. Use vitamin E oil on it, maderma scar cream (I dont know if it actually works, but worth a shot), and arnica gel on the scar tissue, while massaging those in. Really, I can't recommend this enough. \n\nI'm so sorry for how this asshat treated you.  I cant imagine being in your situation. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to chat with. I wish you the best. Also, you're NTA. At all.\n\nu/fuckeduppface",

I'm so so sorry that happened to you. \n\nOP, this isn't your question but I just wanted to share my experience, because I completely relate to the idea of being the girl with the scar. I went through something very similar about 8 years ago.  Half of my face was bloody, swollen and packed with dirt and debris. I sent photos from my ER bed joking about being cast to two face in the next Batman movie. Inside I was devastated. I thought that I was never going to look the same, that I'd always be less attractive and that, like you, I'd always be the girl with the scars. But a weird thing happened because of them. I started to go out, holding my head up high and pretending like I was the most attractive person in the room. I ended up getting more attention and positive regard from people then I ever had in my life. I had spent so long being insecure about my appearance that my scars were finally the thing that set me free. It took me a few years to get to that place but I am really happy I did. \n\n8 years later and they've healed up really well. They're not really super noticable anymore. I still get a comment about them a few times a week (because of the debris not being cleared out - thanks to the ER resident being incompetent - they're a weird color and texture, which makes people think it's something on my face or some kind of weird tattoo). I've gotten very good at nonchalantly responding that they're a scar when people ask what's on my face or try and wipe it off. I still struggle when people ask how I got them (why people feel entitled to this information is beyond me). I can cover them up decently well with make up no I'd I choose, but it took years for them to lighten and flatten to that point. It gets better and easier, physically and emotionally, over time. It's just a long journey and this is the beginning of a long line of assholes (although hopefully this person will be the worst you have to deal with). I wish you the best of luck on it, and just know that it gets better. PM me if you ever want support! I'm rooting for you.",

I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender \"new skin\". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. \n\nIn some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.\n\nBut in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as \"the girl with the scar\" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.\n\nThis week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.\n\nI'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. \n\nIt also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.\n\nSo I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.\n\nI wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... \n\nHis father said to me, \"Can you cover that injury?\" \n\nI said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. \n\nHe started snapping at me saying \"there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.\"\n\nI said \"this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.\"\n\nHe started to backtrack saying \"just until it's healed\" and I said \"it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. \n\nHe actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead.

Don&#39;t stare, and be respectful.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That has stuck with me to this very day.</p>\n\n<p>NTA @OP, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re dealing with this. I hope you&#39;re able to find some compassion from strangers in the future</p>\n</div>",

Plus, in a public place like that, it is likely others would get involved too. I don\u2019t think my family would be ok watching a person be bullied because of their injury. My aunt has been in a wheelchair since birth, and we have had to deal with a lot of ignorant crap from others as a family. There are a lot of people like us out there, who saw our loved ones get mistreated. </p>\n\n<p>Plus, a lot of people would just be angered by this and possibly feel the need to step in, regardless of whether or not that is their own experience. If he kept making a problem out of this, it could have seriously backfired and I think he realized he wasn\u2019t going to win.</p>\n\n<p>OP is a badass.</p>\n</div>",

No drama, no grumpiness, it's just, yeah I have brown hair and hazel eyes and a scar.\n\nI've made a point of teaching my child that people are people regardless of what their exterior looks like, and that it's what's on the inside that really counts.

My teenaged daughter has a male friend whose left arm did not develop completely in utero; it forms a nub about two inches past the elbow and there are a couple little tiny non functional \u201cfingers\u201d at the end. This made my nephew EXTREMELY uncomfortable. He did not know how to process this difference in this boys body, and he did not want to be near him. It was so sad, for both of them. We tried to explain to my nephew that it was nothing to be alarmed about, and we continued to expose him to this boy, but ultimately he just would not warm up to him. It scared him, and no amount of gentle reasoning could convince him that it was nothing to be afraid of. Fortunately, the teenage boy took it all in stride and was not offended, but I was a bit embarrassed about my nephew\u2019s behavior, nonetheless. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily fault the child in this situation, extreme bodily differences can be really difficult for children to process. I do, however, think that the dad in this situation was a major asshole, and could have first tried to reassure his son that this woman\u2019s injury was nothing to be afraid of, and then if/when that didn\u2019t work, he could have arranged to move seats. He did not have to shame this poor woman for having an injury.",

My teenaged daughter has a male friend whose left arm did not develop completely in utero; it forms a nub about two inches past the elbow and there are a couple little tiny non functional \u201cfingers\u201d at the end. This made my nephew EXTREMELY uncomfortable. He did not know how to process this difference in this boys body, and he did not want to be near him. It was so sad, for both of them. We tried to explain to my nephew that it was nothing to be alarmed about, and we continued to expose him to this boy, but ultimately he just would not warm up to him. It scared him, and no amount of gentle reasoning could convince him that it was nothing to be afraid of. Fortunately, the teenage boy took it all in stride and was not offended, but I was a bit embarrassed about my nephew\u2019s behavior, nonetheless. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t necessarily fault the child in this situation, extreme bodily differences can be really difficult for children to process. I do, however, think that the dad in this situation was a major asshole, and could have first tried to reassure his son that this woman\u2019s injury was nothing to be afraid of, and then if/when that didn\u2019t work, he could have arranged to move seats. He did not have to shame this poor woman for having an injury.</p>\n</div>",

Adults tend to just look shocked and look away, or just say \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with your legs, you should cover up!\u201d which is why I never showed my legs for like 10 years... I WISH people would ask, kindly.</p>\n</div>",

It's fair then to expect it will be noticed and be a predominant attribute but thats not to say it will define you or be noticed negatively as an unattractive feature or at all beyond observation.  Myself I never noticed Tina's scar and you'd really think i would as I have scarring myself. I'm looking forward to reading her personal account when her book arrives. \n\nAs I said I have fairly bad scarring myself, acid burns from an attack and early on I was nearly always trying to ascertain how noticeable it is, wether people were making eye contact or scar contact, how much it defines me, wether people dont like me because of it and wether id get more or less sexual attention wirh out it. \n\nNow I don't think of it much, I forget that its there or atleast that its new to new people and especially that it distinguishes me from others or is used as an identifying feature by others  however, I often hear patients that forget my name, before or after a first apppointment referring to me at the front desk as the doctor with the burns. \nOne memory in particular is clear as crystal, \nI remember being stood around the corner from the main desk once, when a male patient arrived to collect a prescription from me, he had social problems and was legally obligated to seek the treatment for addiction and because of said social problems you couldn't compel him tie his own shoes, let alone comply with treatment, he was defiant of everything. so he was always as rude as he possibly could be...When he asked for his Methadone Script at the desk he didnt remember my name and instead referred to me as \"The one with the fucked up throat\" which is pretty egregious as usually people say everything but the scarring, which is telling in itself, they would sooner try and identity my race and come off as racist than show that saw ive got scars, though some do gesture at their face to convey that the scar is what they remember. I was pretty shocked he just spat it out and I TRIED to mutter to a colleague \"Fucked up throat?\" Just to be sure they'd heard the same thing I did and express my incredulity with my dropped jaw and a physical WTF gesture, but unfortunately what actually came out of my mouth was \"FUCK HIS THROAT\" ofcourse coupled with my gaping jaw and raised hands, which my colleague misunderstood to mean, \"I want to fuck his throat\" + an oral sex gesture, and that's the story of how I helped my collegue aspirate and vomit laughter through his nostrils, to this day he refers to that patient as \"the one you are trying to fuck\" and I...am usually more professional..\n\nAnyway, although the majority is on my neck and arms, it obliterated my lip and I worried for a long time that I would be unkissable until I rewatched signs for the first time in a long time and realised that it had never occurred to me that Joaquin Phoenix had facial scarring and despite knowing a decent amount about cleft lip I never thought of him prescarring with a cleft deformity, I always just thought of him as handsome, sexy, edgy, badass and ofcourse incredibly kissable. It was that day that I became...0.1% closer to accepting my face...yeah it wasn't that ground-breaking but it did quell that one fear that somebody else might be nervous of how to kiss me. \n\nWhat actually helped the most overall was realising that I wasn't worried at all about my face when I was alone and then actively surrounding myself with people that I'm so comfortable with that I feel as secure and unaware of myself as I do when I'm alone, once I established that life for myself, socially and romantically my working hours, dealing with strangers and the odd idiot making a big deal about it, turns into a piss-take of suffocating proportions and I find it very easy to laugh at myself and them. \n\nStand up for yourself. Advocate for people similarly effected but take care or yourself first even if that means walking away and always find a way to laugh, it doesn't have to mean you are making light of it if you don't want it to and it gives you power it doesn't make you look less fierce. That being said I Hope your okay OP I really respect your strength in this situation. It was a reasonable and understandable response even if it wasn't a measured and de-escalating one, that's not on you to do and you are definately NTA. \n\nTo the person I've responded to in this thread, sorry for hijacking your simple, to the point and kind comment  about Tina Fey with a boring,  self-centered story, however, it isnt intended to be self serving, this is about OP and her experience, I'm just joining in the conversation to let her know that the people who love you will see your personality and that personality with become you, a scar is not a personality but it is okay to have complex emotions about being a person living with scarring. You have the whole community behind you OP. we all agree with your stance. It would have been easy to look at this happening around you timidly through eyes that seperate two halves of a scar that hes telling you off for having,  say nothing and comtinue that small cry you had for the whole flight. \nSpeaking confidently from the core of your beliefs and not backing down while he stares straight at the face he's criticising you for existing within is not easy and you are a super hero for doing it, for doing anything at all.  Good for you. \n\nP.s I'm sorry you didnt get to be an asshole in this scenario, atleast that massive ass of a dad showed you how little you are missing out on in the mean time but if you want to be TA keep trying, I'm sure you have it in you to be the asshole in another situation even as a survivor with scarring. We are complex personalities and not defined by our scars, we can be anything we want to be, including assholes, anal is important to me, no luck on this occasion but keep trying to find your backside OP.",
