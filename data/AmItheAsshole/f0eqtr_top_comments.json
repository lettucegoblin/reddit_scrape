I also worry about her being in a car accident, she has 3 mountain passes and 160 miles to travel every time she comes home, there are numerous animals to worry about as well during her drive, mostly deer, but cows are not uncommon. I don\u2019t drive this road myself because it is too frightening, but I digress. I\u2019m close to your age, well, in relative terms anyway, I\u2019m 38 years old and you are welcome to message me for any kind of support, even if you need someone to dump your frustrations, anger or anxiety on. I\u2019m almost always available. I\u2019m sure you already have a good support system,  but just in case, I am here and really good at listening and being someone who helps people feel better after they unload their pent up emotions on.  Take care and I hope everything starts to get better with time and the love and support of those who have you and your emotional health in mind. \ud83d\udc96</p>\n</div>",

Feel whatever you need to feel.  You have every right to be sad, angry, numb, crying, whatever.  You and your daughter's memory  were treated horribly, and your marriage has ended because of it--it's okay to feel whatever way you need to feel about it.

I am a stepdaughter and I have a stepdaughter and absolutely 100% your soon-to-be ex stepdaughter or whatever should not in any way, shape or form get one penny of your precious daughter&#39;s college fund! I think what you and your exhusband did by going to your daughter&#39;s favorite place etc is very sweet. I&#39;m so sorry that on top of dealing with the death of your child, you have to deal with crap. I like the idea of paying someone&#39;s tuition or giving a scholarship in your daughter&#39;s name is a sweet idea. Best of luck to you.</p>\n</div>",

It also depends how those assets are divided, which is a state law issue.

In some states, once you get married, assets created in the marriage are community property, and the parties have an equal interest.  Assets you came into the marriage with are your separate property.

If the money put into the fund after the marriage was from income, or something you earned during the marriage, then your current husband would have a 50% interest in that money, and so might be able to get it out.  It doesn't necessarily matter that the account is now just in your ex-husband's name.  If you sold separate property, like  a car you owned before marriage, and used that money to put in the fund, then it remains separate property and your husband has no interest.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that you have a 50% community property interest in all income or assets your husband created during the marriage, too.

Seems like they both have their heads on straight.\n\nTwo of my grandparents have been divorced since at least 15 years before I was born. My grandmother is no longer with us, but she and my grandfather got along very well for as long as I can remember. We\u2019d always have Christmas Eve,  morning, and dinner together; they would sometimes travel together, especially to visit their children or grandchildren; they never fought or argued and they always enjoyed what they did; and my grandfather and his new wife went to my grandmother\u2019s funeral and burial. I think it\u2019s a great example of how people can no longer be in romantic love and separate from a marriage, but still love each other and support each other and interact in an amicable way.",

A few years down the road, Uncle A and Uncle B's wife fell in love, realizing that they were far more compatible with each other than their current spouses. They also realized that their spouses would be wildly compatible with each other. So, they effectively set their spouses up together. When all was said and done; Uncle A and Uncle B's (now ex) wife wound up together raising her kids from Uncle B and having their own kids, while Uncle B wound up with Uncle A's (now ex) wife, raising her kids from Uncle A and having their own. All 4 are just as close as ever 40+ years down the line.",

I mean, obviously you'll have to be a bit creative with how you market your skills, but it really provides alot more options than just seeing patients.

I don't know enough about that to say how exactly that would work though.\n\nBut yeah...if you figure out you hate your career path after finishing a PhD, then shit gets really scary.\n\nEdit : I just read this over and realized I said 'I guess' like five times.
