Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.\n\nI told them \"you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense.\" But they kind of laughed my warning off.\n\nNow, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.\n\nThe llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a \"warning spit\" (just saliva) and they went \"eww\" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.\n\nFinally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.\n\nTo make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Llamas spit in self-defense.&quot; But they kind of laughed my warning off.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I&#39;d trust the llama to teach them a lesson.</p>\n\n<p>The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a &quot;warning spit&quot; (just saliva) and they went &quot;eww&quot; and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.</p>\n\n<p>To make things worse for them, I didn&#39;t even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo&#39;s only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn&#39;t want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.</p>\n\n<p>AITA?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He could call that mom back and tell her not to let her badly raised kids near his petting zoo ever again and demand recompensation for his startled llama, it isn't his job to raise her kids, it's the moms job...I'm ranting, sorry.
