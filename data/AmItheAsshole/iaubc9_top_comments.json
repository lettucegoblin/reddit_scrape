It&#39;s meant to shame you into not doing something he doesn&#39;t understand or appreciate. And you know what? It is okay that he didn&#39;t know at first, but if you are going to be partners then he needs to educate himself.</p>\n\n<p>NTA. Counseling is a good idea, but probably not for the reason he thinks. Please, let it be a black therapist, or at least someone with a background in these issues.</p>\n</div>",

Not as a joke like your husband did) into the conversation. If he married you, he obviously loves you for who you are; no matter your skin color.",

First, I don't think your partner is racist. People grow up handling awkward situations super differently.

An ill-thought joke that kinda addresses an underlying issue is more comfortabble to deal with than what could be the real issue, that maybe your husband is simply turned off by your nightly attire. With full understanding of the maintenance needed for your hair type, maybe y'all can work something else out? Like, do your routine, but buy a cheap \"fuck pillow\" that you can use at night, so that you don't have to wear a bonnet, ruin your pillow, and your husband sees you without a more covered look. He's obvi the AH for being insensitive with words, but I think that maybe he just doesn't want to outright say that your getup is a turn off.",

Him hiding your scarf is cruel, childish, and messed up. It stinks of a power play. You're an adult. Your hair is part of your body and bodily autonomy. Your scarf is your item. He isn't the master over any of that. Stealing and hiding any of your shit from you for a petty reason (as opposed to a legit reason, like, hiding money from an addict) is a red flag.\n\n2. Race issues: he's the one with the race issue. You didn't make him feel bad-- you confronted him with a mirror and he felt bad seeing himself in the unflattering light he painted himself in, and now he's deflecting that to you. White people in general need to care more and understand more about race in America. Especially if he is going to be married to a black woman, he ought to be motivated/invested/taking initiative to get educated and to be actively anti racist, so that he isn't harming the person he loves constantly.  He made inappropriate race comments (re:slave). He showed a lack of understanding and a unwillingness to learn about the needs and experience of his black wife by not getting educated about your hair and the history of black hair care. He was very insensitive. I think therapy is a great idea and of he is proposing it because he recognizes that he has work to do, that makes me hopeful. If he is proposing it bc he thinks you were in the wrong and need to stop 'pulling the race card', and if you go to a therapist who is not specialized in race issues, then you are setting yourself up for a harmful and gaslighting situation. We are baked in racism in America, so any American of any color having wrong or harmful ideas about other races is natural-- it doesn't make them a bad person. It does reflect badly on them if they don't question, fight against, and reeducate those beliefs.\n\n3. His racial beliefs are also intersecting with his gender ideas.  Women of any race, don't naturally exist at all times in a state of perfect beauty and sex appeal. It takes WORK. That work is sometimes unsexy. You want me to be glowy and attractive when we go out to a wedding? Well, get used to me sleeping with my face covered in zit cream and pimple band aides then. I am a white woman with very curly, semi kinky hair. I sleep with my hair wrapped too. I think it looks cute wrapped for bed sometimes, if you choose to look at it like, intimate, here's me dressed down. But yea it definitely doesn't make me feel my sexiest. Having hair that doesn't confirm to traditional beauty standard (silky, wavy, unfrizzy) can make me feel insecure and vulnerable. It is an act of support for my bf to accept my hair routine and to validate when my hair looks all good as a result of my efforts. If your man loves your natural hair and finds you beautiful, then he needs to embrace the process that helps you look that way. All that said, I DO understand if he maybe misses having sexy bed time with your natural gorgeous hair. If that's how he feels, he should say that, instead of calling you grandma. Maybe then you could compromise-- leave it unwrapped one night a week, or, having some pre bed cuddle time, and then go wrap it. Or whatever works for you guys.\n\n4. In reference to therapy, you said, 'I don't want to go through all that'. I generally think therapy is enlightening to all people at all stages of happiness. I think it's worth examining what you mean by 'not wanting to go through all that'. Are you worried that it will require you guys to confront ugliness you've been avoiding looking at?\n\nIn conclusion, you're NTA. I dont think hubs is a full AH either... But it seems like there are several issues going on that should be looked at.",

Still, my boyfriend kisses my \"head fluff\" (his sweet words) and calls me beautiful. He has even washed, conditioned, and detangled my hair. It is because of him that i started embracing my curls and started healing from childhood bullying. My classmates from elementary school to college would make racist remarks about my hair and would even put objects into my hair to see if I would feel it. It was embarrassing. I was so embarrassed and ashamwd of my looks and even my amazing culture that I even shaved my head. It's important to be in relationships with people who embrace you and help your embrace yourself. I hope OP's husband can realize his mistake and work towards bettering himself. OP deserves it.",

I think that does a huge disservice to the client / the couple. \n\nOP, i know there are thousands of comments so i doubt you\u2019ll see this one. but on the miniscule chance that you do, please know a few things: \n\n\u2022 your husband\u2019s comments and behavior, however benign he sees them to be, are not something you need to tolerate. You are not overreacting by ANY stretch by being upset and by feeling gross about them. \n\n\u2022 of course, intent matters, but intent is not everything. \u201ci didn\u2019t mean it that way\u201d is not the \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card that a lot of people seem to think it is. \n\n\u2022 YOU DID NOT \u201cBRING RACE INTO IT.\u201d **He** did by his repeated comments, extremely dicey (at best) comments/jokes, and by *stealing* *and* *hiding* *your* *belongings* because he didn\u2019t approve of them.

He created the problem himself , she is caring for her body the way she needs to. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t like it he could have said that but he didn\u2019t. Instead he made the situation worse for himself by pulling what he did. She made no approach to race until he decided that he was going to compare her to a women with straight hair. Just because she raised her voice doesnt mean she is unable to talk about it , he laughed when she was upset and then when she reacted he became the victim.

He escalated the situation until she was upset enough to yell and then started gaslighting her  There doesnt seem to be any animosity from her for being black with a white man but there is on his side. The comment about wanting to run his hands through her hair could have been stated many times earlier outside of the situation  but it wasnt , he stated it when she was at an emotional high and thought after making these passive agreements jokes that she would be fine with it. </p>\n\n<p>Of course they are approaching race from a different place, but for him to say they need race counseling because she was frustrated that she explained her hair to him and he didn\u2019t respect her or her property ; if anything is relationship. He created the problem himself , she is caring for her body the way she needs to. </p>\n\n<p>If he didn\u2019t like it he could have said that but he didn\u2019t. Instead he made the situation worse for himself by pulling what he did. She made no approach to race until he decided that he was going to compare her to a women with straight hair. Just because she raised her voice doesnt mean she is unable to talk about it , he laughed when she was upset and then when she reacted he became the victim. He could have talked to her about it while she did her hair and discussed the bonnet. Would she stop using it: no but he could been respectful.</p>\n</div>",
