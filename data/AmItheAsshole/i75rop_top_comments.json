There are always posts like \"my whole family is divided because I didn't let my brother propose at my wedding\", \"my best friend ignores me because I mentioned to 5 of our friends I am pregnant at her wedding\", \"my mother doesn't want to come to my wedding because me and my brother are fighting via Facebook posts\", \"my fiance didn't like the ring I proposed with because it wasn't expensive enough\", \"my mother wants to wear a cape to my wedding to steal the attention\", \"my parents don't want to pay for my wedding, they say I could buy a house for that amount of money\", \"my sister doesn't talk to me because her husband died before their wedding and my fiance decided to book their wedding location\". What's wrong with the world and why can't a wedding just be what it is meant to be - a party to celebrate your union with friends and family? No fairytale, no magazine glamour, no Hollywood-like setting.",
