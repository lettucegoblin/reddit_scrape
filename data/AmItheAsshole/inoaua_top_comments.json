I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. \n\nI (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we looked our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It\u2019s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it\u2019s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We\u2019ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It\u2019s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn\u2019t impact how I see him. \n\nMark is single after a breakup right now and I\u2019ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too.

Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn\u2019t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn\u2019t feel like a joke. I told her \u201cif you seriously can\u2019t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you\u2019re not welcome here anymore. You\u2019re 30, act like it. Get out.\u201d\n\nHannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh.

You specifically clarified you want judgement on the way you addressed this, not on your relationship so here's my explanation. \n\nYour GF is being a bigot in displaying constant, hurtful homophobic attitudes and explicitly directing them at your best friend in his own home. You explicitly stated your boundaries and expectations with regards to this behavior, and warned her to stop. When she refused to respect those boundaries, and continued to disrespect both you and your best friend, you enforced your boundaries by telling her she was no longer welcome in your home, thereby removing her opportunity to violate the boundaries you set. \n\nCould you have been more flexible? Sure. You could have sat her down and said, \"Hey, I've clearly expressed my boundaries and how your behavior hurts both me and someone I care deeply about. You've ignored my explicit requests to treat my best friend, and my relationship with him with respect, and I'd like to talk more about that. You know there's nothing between us, so can we try to get to the root of your homophobic impulses? What are you so scared of? Why are you acting so hateful?\" \n\nBut like, that's not your job to help her work through her ignorance for her. Either she wants to, and has the capacity to be honest and self-reflective, or she doesn't care and just hopes to drive a wedge between you and your friend. It sounds like the latter. Maybe she is worried there won't be space for her if she wants to move in with you. Maybe she is unaware of her own homophobia. Maybe something similar happened in the past and she DID lose someone to someone who is was 'just a friend,' but it is 100% *not your job* to do emotional labor for her to figure out her own ignorance.\n\nAnd the thing is, sometimes trying to *understand* bigotry just validates it. People who try to explain away racist statements by pointing out incarceration rates, sexism by pointing out that more bachelor's degrees are earned by women, homophobia by suggesting concern for family values... These are all excuses made to fundamentally treat an individual poorly because of internal biases and belief systems. No one is entitled to kindness or comfort when confronted over viewpoints that are hurtful, harmful and bigoted, especially when they aren't remotely concerned about the harm that their viewpoints have on those to whom they express their 'opinions.'\n\nSo, no. You have no obligation to be *nice* about protecting your boundaries or the humanity of people you love. It doesn't sound like you mocked, pushed, yelled or in other ways acted abusively to her. You just said she wasn't welcome to be a bigot in your home. And frankly, if more people acted that way instead of making excuses like \"well, but normally she's such a sweet person,\" change might happen a lot faster. \n\nTLDR: NTA, and your GF is not entitled to expect respect and coddling when acting like a bigot. You and Mark both deserve better than her in your home (and your lives).",

Ok that sounds just wrong. Basically means that you can Look at people and say that they are attractive but I doesn&#39;t mean you want to fudge them. This woman hasn&#39;t got any sense for her so called age she acts more like I see I want I fudge. She&#39;s really needing to gtfu</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s normal and it doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Mark does find you good-looking, if his feelings for you are platonic and/or brotherly, it&#39;s irrelevant. You can find someone physically attractive without being <em>attracted</em> to them sexually or romantically. </p>\n\n<p>I mean, as a straight woman I can honestly say that there are some women in the world who I genuinely enjoy looking at and find their physical appearance &quot;attractive&quot;, but I have no desire to fuck any of them.</p>\n\n<p>ETA this comment I wrote in response to another commenter: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even if it wasn&#39;t true- if I felt attracted to a friend, and they said they didn&#39;t feel the same way, I would respect their boundaries</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also this! </p>\n\n<p>I have been in the position of having romantic / sexual feelings toward a close friend who didn&#39;t feel the same way. </p>\n\n<p>I respected his feelings about it and made the choice to continue our friendship without hoping or pushing for his feelings to change.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, my non-platonic feelings for him waned and I started to see him more like a brother than anything else. When he started dating his now wife, those feelings all but disappeared because I absolutely loved her and loved seeing them together. A few years later I started dating my now fiance. </p>\n\n<p>This friend has been a huge part of my life for over a decade now and I can&#39;t imagine life without him or with him in any other capacity than a friend. I&#39;m so grateful that I learned how to respect boundaries and value different kinds of relationships for what they are before I met him, because if I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have one of the best friends I&#39;ve ever had.</p>\n</div>",

And did you ever discuss this with your gf?\n\nDon't get me wrong, your gf is saying super homophobic stuff and that's not acceptable behavior. However, you've been dating her a year and you're both 30. That's definitely around the time partners usually want to move in with other partners. They also start discussing future plans (marriage, kids, etc.).\n\nHowever you are currently *very locked* into a living situation with another person. Your best friend is almost literally blocking you and your girlfriend from taking any next steps in your relationship. Like seriously, from an outside perspective I would find that to be a potentially incredibly frustrating position for your gf to be in. \n\nHas your gf ever acted/said anything homophobic before? Because I'm wondering if this is just something she's started saying because she's jealous/frustrated that he gets to live with you and she doesn't. \n\nI'm bi, so I don't think what she's saying is okay by any means. But I can't help but feeling the root of her frustrations isn't homophobia. Granted a more mature person would properly communicate those frustrations with you directly. Instead she's trying to make you paranoid that your friend is into you, presumably so that you'll move out/want to sell the house. She's going about this all wrong and doesn't speak well of her. (And it's totally reasonable to end things.) \n\nBut if you are looking for a long term serious relationship in your future, you probably need to have a plan in place for getting out of your living arrangement and make that clear to them early on (\"If we get serious, we will sell the house.\" \"If we get serious, I will rent out my room to cover the mortgage and we can rent our own place together.\" Etc.)",
