That money was a reason for hope, something special that brought happiness for you and your son to talk about the future. Passing that on to his best friend is incredibly special. Do not allow anyone to take that from you. Do not allow anyone to tell you what you are doing is wrong. What you want to do is absolutely the right thing. \n\nI lost my son to a rare terminal illness a little over a handful of years ago. My family, my son's family was not there as well like how you described. I can relate to all of those feelings for yourself and for your child. My son's 6 years of life were mainly spent in the hospital with me and staff, my best friend who is still there for me and his surviving brother just the same. Those people who are brave enough to set their own fears aside and sit with us, be with us during those times are the ones who mean the most. I learned in my son's life that the hardest times are when we show our true colors. Some apparently do not find their 'shine' and cannot step up. That's on them & frankly I left their opinions of what I should do, especially after his death, in the far past. It literally holds no value for me. \n\nMy son was only well enough to attend a specialized preschool. In that short time, he made one friend. My son was non verbal, blind & was paraplegic. Even so, he definitely had a presence. His friend would get so excited and squeal for him, hug on him. She would tell him stories, they were two peas in a pod at school. Having your child face such things...knowing my son had one friend and knew what that was like meant and still means the world to me. Things like seem simple & easy for average families are monumental for kids & parents of kids who face health issues.\n\nThe child's mother came to his funeral, I still have her card. I will ALWAYS remember them and even now writing about what that friendship meant to my son & myself makes me cry. My point is, these people ARE family for us in a way. People like this are what shows and teaches us what acceptance and love is. \n\nYou should feel free to share your blessings with your son's best friend. Fuck anyone who says different.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nThis has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.\n\nI M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.\n\nDespite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.\n\nI started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.\n\nHe never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. \n\nLast week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this \"opportunity\" away to someone else.\n\nI didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way.

And they think that I&#39;m being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.</p>\n\n<p>I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn&#39;t take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn&#39;t bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn&#39;t let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn&#39;t take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn&#39;t offered any help just words. They&#39;d just talk but do nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the struggle. I&#39;ve created an account for my son&#39;s college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.</p>\n\n<p>I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that&#39;s about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can&#39;t express how his presence in my son&#39;s life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.</p>\n\n<p>He never stopped visiting and asking how I&#39;m doing after my son&#39;s death. He&#39;d show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we&#39;d sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. </p>\n\n<p>Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son&#39;s college money. I didn&#39;t wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son&#39;s friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he&#39;s family. My mom agreed that I wasn&#39;t thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this &quot;opportunity&quot; away to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn&#39;t close to my son I don&#39;t even know why he&#39;d be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew&#39;s college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I&#39;m wrong and that I needed to think about this.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just too much pressure and I&#39;m feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
