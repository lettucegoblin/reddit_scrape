They did testing, which took about 2 weeks to come back. In that 2 weeks, I really struggled with things. I was angry and scared. The thing that made me most upset was thinking about how if the baby did have this major disorder, it would affect my 5 year old sons life in such a negative way. I felt like it was so unfair to put such a burden on him. All of our extra time, attention, and resources would have to go towards caring for her and that just broke my heart. I know it might sound pretty shitty that I thought that way, but those were my honest feelings. The kids who are already here, matter. Thank God all of the testing came back normal and she's doing great now, but those were the longest 2 weeks of my life.

What you need from them - love, support, acknowledgement - they haven't given you and probably won't do that either. I'm glad there are others around you who can.

        "body": "Hi OP,\n\nLet me start by telling you that your feelings are completely legitimate, understandable, and NTA.\n\nI am the youngest of four kids; my oldest brother (R) is severely special-needs and we have grown up helping to take care of him.  My mom had R at 17 years old, and for a baby that wasn\u2019t expected to make it past 8 years old, he\u2019s now going on 34 because of the love and care we all devoted to him.\n\nI love my family. I love my brother with all that I am. I will be there for him until the day I die. All of this is because my family is a *unit*, because it is *our own choice* to make sure he\u2019s happy and healthy. Let me tell you, it isn\u2019t easy: it\u2019s taken me 10 years to be able to get ahold of my anxiety when he has a seizure, for instance. I still struggle, but I\u2019m happy to help and learn and talk to people about it along the way.\n\nMy parents - for our entire lives - worked around *our* schedules.  If we had gymnastics or softball or a choir concert, one parent would take turns to stay home and the other would go attend. They would ask us \u201cwhat are your plans tonight?\u201d And if we didn\u2019t have any, they would kindly ask if they could go out to dinner or a movie or anything and can we take care of R for a couple hours? Which we are all happy to do. If we have plans, then they\u2019ll say \u201cOk, go and have fun!\u201d It wasn\u2019t like \u201cYou need to do this and you need to be here for him.\u201d \n\nI now \u201cwork\u201d for my brother through the State, and am licensed to provide the care he needs. Because I want to if my parents can\u2019t someday.\n\nThat\u2019s the difference here, OP. I made the choice to be there, to take care of him when my parents need a break. But I also have the choice to say no. And you should have had that choice too. Let me tell you, **it\u2019s not for everybody and that\u2019s okay.**\n\nLet me repeat that:\n\n##Taking care of another human being - especially one that has special needs - is not for everybody, *and that\u2019s okay*.\n\nIf any one of us kids didn\u2019t want that responsibility, we would have gotten a home care provider through the many many resources my State offers for people who need it. I\u2019m talking about the good home care aides and nurses who wake up every day and say \u201cI get to see my patient today;\u201cI can\u2019t wait to spend time with so-and-so tonight\u201d. The ones who went to training took the time to get educated, licensed, and signed up with the understanding that they\u2019d be helping take care of someone where others can\u2019t.\n\nSo knowing all this, I want you to appreciate the choice you finally got to make **now**. And I want you to be assured that it was the right one for you in this point of your life.\n\nI want you to enjoy college, try new things and fail and try again. Find that thing that makes you wake up and say \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do this today\u201d. That\u2019s where you should be because it will be your choice; no guilt, no shame. Go study, grow, learn to do the thing that others weren\u2019t meant to do.\n\nKnowing you love your sister and want the absolute best for her - and knowing that you probably aren\u2019t the one to provide that for her - is honestly a very selfless thing; it will save you and her a lot of resentment. But I also hope you are able to forgive your family - the hand they were dealt was a tough one, and I\u2019m sorry they handled it the way they did. That wasn\u2019t your sister\u2019s fault and it wasn\u2019t your fault.\n\nI hope this helps bring perspective and some comfort.",

        "body": "Hey sweetheart,\n\nI know your have a ton of responses and you might not see this, but I wanted to let you know that I hear you, and you didn't deserve to be treated that way. \n\nI have a little sister who sounds a lot like yours: severe autism, also diagnosed with severe mental retardation, and nonverbal. She's 21 now, and essentially a tall toddler. I'm the oldest sibling of 4, and my brother and I were basically extra parents. My life revolved around my sister. I had to plan things around her care. I didn't have my parents' attention. My parents didn't do this weird fraud thing your parents did, but the neglect and abuse of putting me in an adult role at 11 has done its damage, that I'm still working on with my therapist today, in my 30s. What's helped me a lot, and what you might want to consider, is shifting those feelings of anger and hurt to the people who actually caused them: your parents. That said, you don't have to like your sister, or like spending time with her. It doesn't make you bad: that's something I'm still working on. My sister hits me, takes my food, rips my books and anything else she can get her hands on: I've come to terms with the fact that I don't like that, I don't like spending time with her. That's okay. It's not my job, and she's not my daughter. \n\nI'm proud of your for speaking up and getting your needs met. I'm proud of you for being willing to look at feelings that aren't popular, and reach out for support. I'm so so glad you're getting the support and love you need.\n\nIf you ever need to talk so somebody who knows what's up, please feel free to PM me. That goes for any lurkers with special needs siblings. It's a hard life to live, and we often get ignored, or told we're \"so strong for helping,\" \"such a blessing to your parents\": but you deserve to live your life for you, not as someone's unpaid nanny.",

As someone with a severely disabled sibling, I want to illustrate how this is supposed to work.\n\nMy sibling is mentally and physically handicapped (think an infant stuck in an adult body.) My family is very lucky that he qualifies for a lot of assistance from the government to take care of him (due to the nature of his disability.) That money is supposed to go to care takers, equipment, and other essentials directed towards **his care.** There are lists of things that money can and can't get used for. When he was an adult, his rights to dictate his life were waived (because he doesn't understand virtually anything that happens around him.) And an official observed his living conditions to make sure he was being cared for, and that his rights getting waived wasn't a form of financial abuse (OPs parents sound like they were definitely using the sister for financial abuse IMHO.)\n\nMy sibling is older than me. He requires skilled nursing care. As a child I was never expected to care for him. While I was taught basic things like tube feeding, how to treat/recognize seizures ect, I only learned those things in case I was left alone with him and couldn't find an adult to help.\n\nAs an adult, I was encouraged to learn how to take care of him. It would've been a great skill to put on a resume, it would've lifted some financial burden off of the family, and it would've given my parents peace of mind that my sibling would've been cared for if my sibling outlived them. It became clear that I did not have the constitution, confidence, or general suitability needed to care for my sibling properly.\n\nWhile I am sure it disappointed my parents that neither me nor my other siblings would be able to become caretakers, they accepted this, and sought other strategies to give my sibling care in the case that he outlived them.\n\nAs I understand it, me and the other siblings will be in charge or guaranteeing my sibling's well being. But we will  be hiring other people to take care of him, while we essentially quality check his care, and advocate for him when he needs it.\n\nIt is absolutely wrong that your parents or OPs parents force the care of a sibling on you. There are people trained to take care of our siblings. We do not suddenly get that responsibility thrust on us because we happen to be related. OPs parents using him as a free care giver is both neglectful to the sister (robbing her of trained care) and neglectful of OP (for obvious reasons.) Your parents expecting you to care for your sibling despite danger to yourself is also neglectful to you. You have your own needs, and there are other people better equipped to take care of your sibling than you.\n\nDon't let anybody tear down your life because of a sibling. You have just as many needs as your sibling, his needs are simply more difficult to meet. But it is up to the parent to make sure the needs of both kids are met. ",

If the parents were told she needs a caretaker, then she NEEDS a caretaker. Maybe she would be able to make some improvements if she was working with a professional. I get that she's low functioning, but it's possible that she can sense the animosity OP was beginning to feel toward her (which is not his fault). Which could cause her to lash out more?\n\nIdk I have a severely autistic cousin (he is verbal and doesn't need 24/7 supervision though) and he has a loving family who is always there for him. I wonder how lost he would be without that support system. OP's parents obviously don't care about their autistic daughter, if they did they wouldn't push her off on a teenage brother who obviously isn't capable of handling that responsibility, or use her to scam their family.\n\nI just hope she will be OK. What are the parents going to do with her now that their free babysitter and money are gone? Are they going to pay for a professional caretaker themselves, or just neglect her? OP if you see this, this is NOT a guilt trip, but someone in your family should keep tabs on what's going on with your sister. It sounds like she may be better off in an institution then with parents who obviously can't or aren't willing to give her the care she needs.",

If my parents had been religious or a little bit less stubborn or made a little bit less money, or if I had been born first rather than my sister, I could easily see them taking up some of the same stances that yours did.

I will put this out there about therapy... Distance from parents and having positive role models around you who don't have the same issues helps a lot to establish a baseline for how people are supposed to treat each other, which you can wear like armor to make life with parents more bearable;  Talking about your issues helps, but never as much as this distance and these other influences.

A puppy that your parents vastly prefer to you, is not really worth your hatred - the resentment is something to harbor for your parents, and the situation that ended up with them having a puppy.  Inflicting pain on the puppy doesn't help anything, it's a misfire of an otherwise useful instinctual response you have for how to deal with social situations & people who cause you pain.  But this is not a social situation.\n\nMy sister didn't choose to be a burden, because my sister can't make choices, period, that are more complicated than asking for food or sitting still for 5 minutes.  I have never had a conversation with my sister - she has less exhibited intelligence than a pet cat.  I don't say this to insult her, but to ask: Is it worthwhile considering her as a person who has agency?  She's a human being, certainly, but with so much congenital brain damage she can't fulfill any of the responsibilities or contemplate any of the rights that we endow \"persons\" with.  It doesn't really make sense to hold her accountable for things, because person-hood and social blame and resentment is about the base social expectation of reciprocal conduct, which she is literally incapable of conceiving.",

It doesn&#39;t really make sense to hold her accountable for things, because person-hood and social blame and resentment is about the base social expectation of reciprocal conduct, which she is literally incapable of conceiving.</p>\n</div>",

They believed it was your sole purpose to care for your sister, not to have a life of your own.\n\nThey treated you like a free caretaker, not as an independent person worthy of your own life, your own dreams, your own goals. THEY chose your goals for you, and without - or in direct contrast to your input.\n\nBut from their perspective... THEY didn't ask for this burden either. They assumed they were going to be getting another normal healthy child, and instead were given a person who needs constant and direct care. THEY don't get to live their lives anymore either. And they've been swept up in that for a very long time. They feel like they've been given this burden, and that you're all in it together as a family.\n\nYour mind can do very strange things when its under constant extreme stress. As they see it, they made the best decisions with the information available. They made one consolation, chipping away at your individualism, and that seemed reasonable.... then struck another chip away... then another... then another. Each individual step seeming perfectly reasonable. But they can't look at it as a whole.\n\nThat's where strangers or people who are not experiencing that daily trauma have to come in and lend perspective. Somebody has to step outside of that loop and lend a reasonable ear. Somebody has to right some wrongs that have been too long in coming.\n\n-------\n\nI'm glad you've found somewhere you can breathe and spend these last years to be a young adult and grow up in a less toxic environment.\n\nI'm hopeful that if your parents are given enough time, and actually get your sister enough professional help that they themselves can take that step back and see the errors of their ways. But if they can't that's their problem, not yours.\n\nJust keep breathing, just keep living. Make some goals and work toward them. But most importantly - Go have some fun. You deserve it.",

I was a counseling intern once upon a time, but, b/c of my college experience, I made sure I was ready. I read and studied constantly. I watched videos of effective sessions. I kept a pad with questions and responses with me in case I blanked. If I needed help from my supervisor, I got her involved. I talked to the experienced counselors on staff regularly. My point is, you have to be careful with counselors at colleges. You never know what you will have to work with. The same can be said to some extent for licensed counselors.
