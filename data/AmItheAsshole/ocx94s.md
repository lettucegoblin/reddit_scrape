My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.
His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.

Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. 

Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.
I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!

Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.
Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said "my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.
He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.

I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from "spending time" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.

She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.

Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.

NTA. Don't back down. You are the only one sticking up for Zoey. If her cousins want to use expensive makeup, give them your wife's. I guarantee she won't appreciate sharing anymore.

They need to start behaving like appreciative guests.

 I love this idea. NTA OP - you have your daughters back and totally get her need for privacy and autonomy over her stuff. I’m disgusted that her own mother isn’t more supportive. Please lend some mothers makeup to the twins, because obviously it’s what girls do, isn’t it? They love to borrow and use each other’s stuff. Without asking. Not.

  Bonus if OP goes into Sammy's room to borrow things without asking. Underwear, an expensive watch or something. Returning it with visible wear and tear. Nutella would be my friend for his favorite pants.

   Lol, return underwear with stains? Man, I'd never mess with you.

     My grandad would do this with gingerbread biscuits that apparently look convincingly like shit if you wet them and smear them on a wall - someone would say "my god is that shit on the wall?" then he'd wipe some on his finger, taste it and go "yep that's shit alright". Made one guy vomit on the spot apparently.

     Back in college, my roommate and I were exchanging pranks as part of an underlying feud. He was bringing a girl over that night, so I took a pair of his boxer briefs out of his dresser, and smeared a healthy amount of that natural peanut butter (with the oil and nut chunks) on the ass part, and left it visible on his bedroom floor. 
     
     They went into his room and a few seconds later the girl walked out quickly. Turns out they walked in on our cat licking the peanut butter out of it and it totally grossed both of them out. I did not expect this but it made it more hilarious, looking back.
     
     My roommate was pretty upset. For him to believe it was peanut butter, I had to willingly take a whiff out of the “stain” with no disgust on my face, then he hesitantly tested it out. We agreed no more pranks after that, apparently he really liked that girl.

    Don’t underestimate how grotesque people can be. When I was 18 I lived with 4 other girls…. The one girl (22f) used to take my underwear, wear them, and then put them back in my room in my dirty clothes (she didn’t like to do laundry and would run out). Needless to say when I discovered this, I started locking my door every time I left. 
    
    NTA OP- teenagers typically want privacy anyways. Please continue sticking up for your daughter & hopefully your wife comes to her senses since it sounds like she’s being a real ass right now. Your daughter will remember forever that dad has got her back, no matter what!

   Ah see I’d agree with you here, but they are excusing this behavior because they are “teenage girls” and this is “what teenage girls do.”  They would say it’s not the same thing if OP did it or gave them his wife’s make up. 
   
   
   Idk why but they make up kit makes me irrationally angry. I hope someone replaces that for her. Also, when the BIL said it’s “just like the $15 kit from Walmart” why doesn’t he get a couple of those for his girls? And if they have them, ask him why he’s okay with them taking hers if they are the same thing?
   
   NTA. Keep the lock on the door.

  My sister would do this all the time when we were teenagers and my parents always told me to work it out ourselves. I felt helpless to do anything because I couldn't always be there to stop her and it was infuriating. My dad got me a lock and it really made me feel like he recognized my frustrations and supported me. This dude is doing a great service to his daughter. A teen needs privacy and security, especially when they've felt powerless in their own home.

   A home without privacy and security is not a home at all.

    I second this. Grew up in an emotionally, financially and sometimes physically abusive home with too many people and frequent live in guests who treated it like a vacation home. Privacy and common courtesy was non-existent. As a teenager this type of thing slowly messes you up. Hold your fort op.

     ### 42 points by TickleMonster528

     So true, it definitely puts a kink in a teens emotional growth. My parents took my door of the hinges when I was like 15 and it only made me angrier, which lead to me being even more rebellious, it wasn’t a good mix haha.

      Seriously can’t understand how people fail to see an issue with doing things like that. I slept in the living room for all of my teens and my early 20s. Lack of privacy in your own home really really messes you up mentally. To this day my mother doesn’t understand why I don’t want her to EVER enter my room.

     Mom was a fucking disaster and allowed friends and their kids to use our home as their own.
     
     Seriously fucks kids up when there's no sense of safety/security or sense of ownership.
     
     As much as I hate to say it, OP seriously needs to get these people out of the house immediately. If someone can't respect your space, privacy or property, they absolutely should not be in your house.

    Grew up with an older brother with zero respect for others belongings. He'd borrow valuables and return them broken. Steal valuables and sell them for drug money. People deserve to feel secure in their own home and that extends to their belongings.

   My older sister constantly used the expensive colouring pencils I saved up for over a year to buy (and constantly anxiously checking this big box was still for sale whenever we were in the store). I was 12, sister was 16. My mom's reaction to my tearful pleas to stop my sister? "She's much better at drawing than you are, so stop whining!"

   Can't reply anymore since the thread is locked, but thank you all for your kind words and understanding. I have tried going NC with my parents several times but was not supported in that by my then partner (there's a pattern there...) Now I just don't really discuss important things in my life with them anymore, keep contact to a minimum, mostly about the children who do like their grandparents, and patiently await the moment I will receive my inheritance which will help me financially to finally have some freedom.

    And as OP's kid isn't a legal adult, she is 100% dependent on her parents to stick up for her. If she were an adult roommate whose name was on the lease, she could call the cops and have these theives removed from her home, no questions asked

   ### 21 points by chesterfielders

   I work with teenagers, and absolutely hate it when parents tell the kids to work it out. All that means is that the least responsible, most bullying kid will win, at least not without parental intervention.
   
   I remember one case where the daughter was getting detentions for being late to school because her brother would not get to the car in time to get to school. I told her to take off without him, but her mother said she couldn't do that, so of course, she had more detentions.

   I feel especially bad for Zoey who has been invaded by her cousins. How horrible to coming home and never knowing what is missing! OP did the right thing for his daughter. BIL is teaching his adult daughters it’s ok to “borrow”.  Mom is TA for not protecting her daughter and  for shaming her husband. Time for BIL et al to move out.

   My mother would have drawn and quartered us had we taken our siblings things without permission. I frequently left my journal all over the house after writing in it. My mom would pick it up and put it back in my room. She was and is vigilant about privacy. And now we are the same way with our kids.

   My brother robbed me blind when I was a teen; he broke into the locked box I put my first ever wages in to and stole them, and I was distraught. I bought a fitted a lock myself, when what I really wanted was for my Parents to sort him out. This kind of thieving led to bigger thieving later on.

   ### 10 points by LuckOfTheDevil

   I remember one of my cousins (17f at the time) sitting down with my aunt (who was pulling this "work it out yourselves" nonsense) and her sister (20f) and stating very calmly "I have asked Sister politely on multiple occasions to stop using my things without permission. I have now asked you to intervene. You aren't doing anything. The problem continues. You have now told me to work it out. At this point, this is your tacit approval for me to beat the brakes off of her, which is what WILL be happening if she touches my stuff again. You can warn her and put a stop to this, but I do not want to hear it if she comes crying about it, because I will do it. Further touching of my stuff is not an option. You have been warned." My aunt tried to get all huffy and say that wasn't appropriate but my cousin was just not having it. At some point she said "Control your brat, or I will." It got super ugly. I (26 at the time) remember being mystified that all my aunt had to do was a relatively small amount of basic parenting (I myself had kids at the time and so I wasn't ignorant of the ways of such things) but she'd rather fight over whether it was appropriate for her daughter to be mad her brat sister was appropriating her shit. Sometimes, honestly, people like this really only DO understand harsh payback style justice. My cousins did eventually get into a nasty fight. The older tried to press charges on the younger. The cops laughed and left.

  This. It also bothers me that Sammy dared to call Zoey "defective" when his kids are taking and ruining other people's property.
  
  I have friends that I'm so close to, we will go to each other's gyno appointments to give support if need be. No way in h*ll am I messing with their makeup without permission. My closest friends are twins, and they don't even mess with each other's makeup without asking.

   ### 1156 points by TheoryAddict

   Honestly those two girls were taking *extremely* expensive stuff to begin eith (a school *laptop*?) And OP didn't call them theives but if the glove fits...
   
   Im a twin too but I dont go stealing my twins shit (unless its snacks but thats a mutual thing lol).
   
   I honestly feel like the makeup, while seemingly not as 'big' or 'expenisve' as the other things was just the straw that broke the camel's back.
   
   OP, if they never returned the items they took you could ask for reimbursment or start charging them rent if they arent paying rent already. 
   
   I would also ask your wife if her supporting her brother and his daughters with them stealing and harming your daughters things is worth the strain on hers and your daughters relationship. 
   
   Tell her that her not backing her up and making excuses for horrible behaviour will make her feel not safe in her own home and not cared for by her mother. This is some relationship ruining shit because teenagers need privacy and want to know they are safe in their own home. 
   
   And OP is being generous if they are taking stuff and not giving it back because he could have easily of called the cops on the *adult* twins and say they were stealing from his *minor* daughter. Not to mention your wife backing up her brother after the hurtful comments. 
   
   OP you need to talk to your daughter and alsolet her know if her mother says anything that makes her upset she can come to you and trust you. Your the only one she has!

    NTA part of raising a socially well-adjusted daughter is teaching her she has autonomy, and the right to say no to anything. A lock is just a physical manifestation of a default “no”

     ### 302 points by threecolorable

     THIS—the lock gives her a way to enforce her boundaries!

     ### 40 points by [deleted]

     This. Teaching your daughter boundaries and teaching her how to enforce them is essential. She needs to know that it is OK to set appropriate boundaries. You do NOT want her to become a people pleaser and believe that her own needs are not important. Thats what she will take away from this if your wife continues enforcing her own people pleasing towards her brother and his kids on your daughter.
     
     I find it rich that the guy who has moved himself and his adult daughters into your house gets to have an opinion on anything. Because he shouldn't. He's not a house guest. He's a mooch as are his daughters. Financial problems happen, but when they happen and people bail the person out, it should be met with a "thank you! how can I help make this work so we are as little of an imposition as possible?" As to his daughters... it sounds like the apples do not fall far from the tree. His entitlement is astounding and the entitlement he is teaching and enforcing in his daughters is astounding.
     
     The only way you wbta is if you allowed these people to continue running rough shod over your family. I think its time for you to sit him and your wife down and ask him what his plan is for finding a place of his own and how he plans to afford it. Then give a time frame for when he has to leave. He absolutely should NOT be living there without a plan. Given that literally every place is hiring right now, he should be working to get back on his feet, even if it is not in his industry and even if it is a step down. Likewise, the 18 year olds should be doing the same. They need to get summer jobs so they have spending money to buy their own stuff.

     YEP. She’s more than welcome to open the door when she consents to visitors in her space! The lock itself does not prevent bonding/closeness. It just prevents this particular boundary violation. 
     
     As an adult, I have a lock on my front door. It is not a sign that I am anti-social or selfish. I can open my door to let in guests whenever I like, and I often do. But my home is MY space, and nobody enters without my explicit permission. That’s what her bedroom should be to her.

    ### 417 points by MissLadyLlamaDrama

    The wife seems like one of those people who will do anything and everything to appease her toxic relatives. One of those "but they're faaaaaaamily" people.
    
    She needs to realize that her family now is the family she chose when she got married and decided to raise a child. THAT is her family. And she is risking her relationship with them in order to let her brother take advantage of her obsession with pleasing this loser brother, for no other reason than sharing DNA with him.
    
    The rest of the family didn't take them in. Which kind of tells me that either they know his family are a bunch of thieves, or OPs wife has become the go-to for brushing everyone's problems on to because they know she doesn't have the spine to tell them 'no'. Either way, the wife needs to get her shit together and start defending her daughter. Otherwise she might just find that the only one by her side at the end of this is her shitty brother and his thief daughters.

     ### 169 points by Self_Reddicating

     They'll be by her side, right until she doesn't have anything for them to mooch off of. After that, she's competition in their familial mooching game, so they'll cut her loose in order to get first mooching rights on other family members.

      ### 24 points by MissLadyLlamaDrama

      You are so right. She needs to stop defending her loser brother asap. If she keeps him around, she is screwed.  
      
      
      BUT, if she kicks them out, one of two things is going to happen:
      
      1. Her family will swoop in and accuse her of leaving her brother and his kids homeless. In which case, she knows that the whole "family value" thing is bull shit. Otherwise they would respect her choice to defend her family, OR, at the very least, take it upon themselves to offer to accommodate the brother and his kids themselves. If they don't, then she can use that to realize that she is putting out way more effort than anyone else, and that the "family" crap is just an excuse they use to unload their bull shit onto her, so they don't have to deal with it themselves. or....
      2. They will understand and realize why they kicked these people out of their home, and respect their decision to do so. In which case, the only people who are gonna be upset are the brother and his daughters, and that's their own fault for disrespecting the people who are LETTING THEM LIVE IN THEIR HOME FOR FREE. So who gives a crap if they're upset?

     ### 11 points by TheMostBrokenBoy

     I have a feeling wife probably had to "just get over" a lot while she was younger, and that's why she doesnt see how harmful her diminishing and discounting of her daughter's  feelings is.
     
     Just because you turned out "ok" after having dealt with bullshit doesnt mean you should feel justified passing down a bullshit legacy to your kids. It means you need to actually be  better.

    Yeah, the mom is thinking her relationship with OP and kid is solid so she’s worried about what the family will think. Guess what lady, it’s on rocky ground. And she needs to get on the same page as her husband and child before she’s worrying about not being the nicest person ever. Hell having someone who will be strong is probably why this pushover married OP. 
    My grandma told me when my grandpa kicked her mom his MIL out of their house one night was when she knew she had chosen the right man.

    ### 13 points by MrsMayhem17

    Whether the girls gave the stuff they were taking back is not the issue and it really doesn’t make it any worse if they didn’t. The point being that taking something from someone else and using it, even if you give it back, is still stealing. If you go into a store and open a lipstick and use it then put it back, it’s stealing. I don’t understand how the brother doesn’t understand that his girls really are thieves just from using her stuff. 
    
    To the contrary, I think the makeup thing is actually worse than them using other items of hers. It’s an expensive item that she saved up to buy for herself. They took it, used it, and made a mess of it by mixing shit up. The value of something isn’t necessarily tied to its price. 
    
    The worst part of all of this is the lack of respect and basic decency to ask to use her stuff, especially after it was known that she was upset by it. In my house nobody uses my stuff without asking. Not even my boys or husband. Same goes for the other way around.

    My mother always told me never to share makeup. I remember walking in on my roommate using my expensive Aveda palette to do one of her friend's makeup. I almost died. I could never use it again, and some of those colors were discontinued.

     If it's just powder, you can disinfect it with rubbing alcohol. That's what makeup artists do.

      ### 218 points by AffectionateAd5373

      I work in the industry, so I'm aware. But it's so ingrained (and I have OCD, which doesn't help) that I literally had to throw them all out. And seriously, if the alcohol thing really worked no one would get an infection from the testers.

       ### 226 points by doughnutmakemelaugh

       Tell you a secret.
       
       Whole lot of testers out there not being cleaned at all.

        ### 136 points by AffectionateAd5373

        True. But surface sanitizing with alcohol is never going to kill everything. 
        
        When I was doing makeup professionally, I used to scrape a bit of the shadow or whatever onto a clean surface, and use that. I never put the brush into the container from the skin.

       Plus, I find the formula is never quite the same after it. Cheapo makeup, whatever. But when I’m buying expensive makeup *because* of their very specific formulas, warping it with alcohol means it’s essentially a junk palette now.

        ### 40 points by AffectionateAd5373

   He called Zoey defective for buying and using expensive makeup, so she would look more like an adult. Then his child steals this makeup. Would that not also make the BILs child defective, by his standards?! 😂

    They are adults and can have adult consequences applied to theft and harassment.

    ### 30 points by HeatherReadsReddit

    Exactly! Why is Zoey defective for using the makeup, but his brats aren’t?  
    
    OP thank you for standing up for Zoey. As you know, they are stealing - not borrowing - and your daughter needs to feel safe in her own home. Please try to make BIL and the cousins leave ASAP.   
    
    Or you and Zoey find somewhere else to be, leaving all of the thieves on their own.

   ### 302 points by MissLadyLlamaDrama

   Also, what the hell is Sammy's problem that he can even try to pretend that what his daughters are doing is "borrowing". Borrowing implies that they asked permission from Zoey before using her stuff. He knows damn good and well that's not what his kids are doing.
   
   Sammy is a shit brother, uncle, AND father. My god. The divorce thing seems significantly less surprising now, knowing that this is how he actually behaves as a grown ass adult.

    ### 9 points by NaeBean

    No, "borrowing" implies that the item in question is being returned, presumably in the same condition in which it was loaned. In this case, we're talking about makeup, a consumable. Not only are Sammy's daughters sneaking into Zoey's bedroom to take (not borrow!) her stuff without permission, but they are consuming and ruining something that Zoey saved up to purchase. You are NTA for supporting your daughter's right to not have her possessions stolen and ruined under the guise of "borrowing."

   ### 267 points by TheCrankyRunner

   Exactly. OP is definitely NTA. Quite frankly, as soon as that worthless BIL opened his mouth to insist his daughters "aren't thieves," I would have let him know that taking items from someone without their knowledge or consent constitutes theft, and those who engage in theft are, in fact, thieves. 
   
   OP needs to throw them all out of the house yesterday, his AH wife included. The sheer lack of respect she has for the well being of her own child is shocking and completely unacceptable.

   ### 89 points by al_m1101

   Yeah OP should also *demand* the father replace that $60 makeup pallet. And not some shitty Wal-Mart one either. Ooh that would incense me.

    ### 25 points by SubstantialDrawing7

    Definitely. I don't personally have a preference between brands like Wal-Mart and Ulta, but I am a strong believer in repaying somebody with the fair equivalent of what they spent. I have accompanied my friends to Ulta and Sephora more than enough times to know how much this stuff costs, and giving them a cheaper brand wouldn't be right.

   ### 21 points by gorramfrakker

  Plus sharing makeup is so unsanitary. That goes on my face, I don’t want someone else also using it on theirs. So gross. Plus if the colors were mixed she was definitely double dipping. I think cousins owe her at least a new makeup pallet. NTA

   ### 21 points by Dangerous_Wishbone

   and heck if she buys a new one for Zoey she might as well just keep the one she used, and then she won't have a reason to go using someone else's makeup again, and no makeup will be wasted. She shouldn't have used it to begin with but either way Sloan's getting more than a good compromise here, she'll essentially have paid $60 and gotten a $60 makeup set so should have no reason to complain. But definitely needs to apologize and stay out of her stuff.

  Also sharing makeup is unhygienic. Bacteria city. So they basically ruined Zoe’s makeup, not borrowed. The mom should understand this and want to prevent her daughter from waking up with a face full of cold sores or styes.

  ### 9 points by meservyjon

  OP should lend his daughter his wife's makeup, then when your nieces steal it and return it in horrible shape, give it back to your wife with the expectation that using other people's things, and ruining it is perfectly fine. That will open up the discussion as to why is it not ok for her own belongings when it's happening to her daughter. It doesn't matter if it's $15 dollars or $120 dollars, touching other people's things without permission is stealing. 
  
  
  But, I feel this on a spiritual level. So I'm gonna rant about it.
  This is a serious discussion about boundaries. If a person, especially a young woman, cannot feel comfortable setting boundaries at home, how the hell are they gonna grow up feeling comfortable setting boundaries with others when they are in hard pressed situations when they are older?
  I get that some people have relationships that will allow them to take their friends things comfortably, but if everyone involved is not comfortable, then it is stealing, and returning it in bad shape is vandalism. The uncle telling OP he shouldn't be allowing his own daughter to buy makeup WITH HER OWN MONEY, he is crossing a boundary. She is your daughter and teaching your daughter to save up and buy nice things is a great way for her to take pride in her hard work. Allowing other people to step in and destroy the things she earned teaches a lesson that says her hard work doesn't matter. The uncle should either pay for the makeup his daughters ruined, or have a serious discussion with his daughters about respecting boundaries. And OP's wife is completely supporting this behaviour of theft and vandalism. She should be the one to pay for it with her own makeup and her own laptop and her own belongings. If you don't set boundaries at home, then that teaches a lesson that says boundaries do not matter. I believe it's important to not only set the expectation that taking, and ruining other people's belongings is wrong, but to do it in a way that sets an example to your daughter that it is important for her to stand up for herself, and that she needs to take pride in owning the things she worked so hard for.

 You know I probably shouldn't be saying this but my wife has been acting like a hypocrite latey. Especially regarding privacy issues. She considers privacy something very important but still thought that Zoey did not have the right to get a lock - Even if we leave her cousins out of this matter. My wife is not agreeing with the whole concept of getting a lock for Zoey. I explained to her what's been happenning, Even told her that Zoey has been moving some of her valuable belongings into a friend's house to keep them safe, do I blame her? Absolutely not. But my wife still thought Zoey was wrong to do that.
 Now her cousine are upset and they and Sammy are using the silent treatment (among other things like eating without us or not sitting with us) as a guilt tactic. Even though it's not affecting me, it's making Zoey feel like she did something wrong by having a lock for her room.

    u/OnlyInQuebec9 you need to tell your wife this!!! They are bullying her, they were bullying her to begin with and they (and your wife) are now gaslighting her. Your daughter has a right to feel safe in her own home and your wife is contributing to taking that away from her. NTA.

    This whole situation makes me sick. u/OnlyInQuebec9 has way more patience than I ever could. I'm a bit disgusted with OP's wife, I'm sorry to say, but I have the feeling she knows deep down inside that she's in the wrong but is willing to excuse it out of not wanting to deal with the backlash of her brother for some reason(s).
    
    I personally would not only have a firm discussion with the BIL, but I would with his daughters as well. You DO NOT steal shit from anybody in this household without first asking permission to use it. PERIOD. Then present them with an ultimatum. If that makes them upset, good, facing repercussions for inexcusable actions is part of growing up and seeing as how they are now adults, they're falling behind as a result of poor parenting.
    
    As harsh as that may sound, OP would actually be doing them a favor, because this sort of unfettered lack of respect for other people and their property won't just come to an end when they finally move out. It'll likely manifest itself in situations where people won't be so kind or forgiving of them—possibly even legal altercations.
    
    It sounds like your BIL is setting himself up for a rough future and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.
    
    I will say with utmost certainty (unless for some reason you're omitting crucial details) that you are absolutely NTA and should stand your ground. You are in the right here.

    OP should also round everyone up and warn them that Sammy's gone if he finds that lock tampered with at all. It might be a long shot, but I wouldn't trust the other adults in this situation given how opposed they were to the lock and it would probably be a good idea to get out in front of them and draw a line before anyone makes an attempt to go behind someone's back. Call me cynical, see a lot of irrational and misguided people in these stories, just throwing a play out.

      This sounds familiar; my mom's friend got divorced bc her hubby was sleeping around and she got the house and custody of the kids. Well. Eventually, with weekends at dad's, they realized they could get away with a lot of bullshit. They eventually, one at a time, decided they wanted to run away to daddy's. Well, kids go there and realize that mac and cheese isn't a meal and the "fun" parent just didn't give a shit at all, not just about what they weren't supposed to be doing. He didn't care about them at all. And when he had them full time, he started to get temperamental with them and get frustrated easily because, let's face it, kids are a lot of work and he was still honeymooning with his new girl, who wants kids to ruin that???  They realized they hadn't had a proper meal in months and they weren't wanted or loved by daddy, so they realized their fuck up and went home. Eventually, I hope the twins realize they should've stayed with the "more strict" parent, because then maybe they could become decent adults.

    My family is made up of codependents and enablers and I do alright with myself until they are around but when I am around them having boundaries is out the door. They do not respect them or acknowledge them and they will bully me until I give them up. It could be 100% her family triggering this response in the wife. I had to go no contact with my mother and I can have a little involvement like in texts with my brother but it gets to where I have to walk away from even that much.

     I am also looking at this and wondering if OP is codependent. His wife sounds toxic. I came to the realization of how messed up my childhood was when I started to think about the shit that happened to me happening to my daughter and I was like, “no fucking way.”  It was an eye opener for me to think that I never would tolerate those things being done to my child when they were just my “normal.”  This can be the beginning of a painful process that leads to better mental health and happiness. OP sticking up for his daughter here is most excellent and a start in the right direction.

I can honestly say that if this happened in my house, then the wife and I would have had it out well before it got to this point, so I feel like you're on to something with this codependency crap. I could grin and bear shitty situations with he best if them, but when my kids are being hurt and harmed, repeatedly, and their mom is enabling and participating in it? Fuck all that.

   Hi I'd literally just like to repeat something you wrote as it's so important. Enforcing her personal boundaries gives her nothing to lose except bad relationships. NTA op, you are not just looking after your daughter short term, you are modelling useful behaviour to her later in life. Does your wife want your daughter to be someone that doesn't enforce her own boundaries? That the cousins or the brother in law, that even the mom doesn't understand is not relevant, they are not their boundaries. Your daughter has a reasonable boundary which can be harmlessly respected, that it hasn't been has made her hide her belongings and you to get a lock, that they still aren't is what is causing the ongoing drama. There would be no problem if the kids or the brother or your wife had at any point been like no, respect her boundary

  Op you are NTA and you're being a really good Dad here. When Zoey is an adult and gets to choose what kind of relationship she has with her parents- she's going to remember her Dad taking her feelings seriously and protecting her.

     Oooh very true. This could 100% end their marriage. Its a very serious issue and it seems like its simmering right now. Whatever next step OP takes is a risk. If his wife stays on her brothers side, thats it, marriage over. No parent who cares about their child should back down against abusers.

  16 is still young and is a minor who's likely to be at home for another 2-3 years depending on when how old they are during senior year. 
  
  18 can move out and start being completely independent. I think it's telling that two 18 year olds moved with their dad instead of staying with mom where they grew up. 
  
  Do the 3 of them have jobs? Do they have a timeline of when to be out by? To save money? Are the twins going to college in the fall? 
  
  I hate to say it but if I were in your shoes I'd be worried that they have now moved in for a good, long time unless you become a firm boundary, line in the sand person. Like saying "this needs to be dealt with", and demand your wife go to couples therapy - with only you, or family therapy with only you and your daughter. No extended family, so that you can work through immediate family issues, like why your wife suddenly went from valuing privacy to thinking your daughter doesn’t deserve boundaries and it's ok to make your daughter feel like she doesn't matter. 
  
  The biggest issue is following through on whatever consequence you place out if your wife isn't willing to change, if it's that you and your daughter get an apartment, or that you kick out the in law's, or that you threaten divorce. Don't say a consequence that you won't follow through on, or they'll just get 1000 times worse bc they know you won't act on your threat/ you're bluffing. 
  
  And silent treatment is a go to of an abusive relationship, Zoey feeling guilty to apologize for something that a. *Isn't wrong* and b. *Is protecting herself* is *exactly* what they want. They want an apology for your daughter valuing herself. Please don't let her. This is early conditioning of manipulation which easily leads her to become an easier target for toxic and/or abusive relationships.

   You make an excellent point. The brother-in-law and his two poorly raised kids have successfully driven a wedge between OP and his wife. What’s next? 
   
   Dollars to donuts they’ve gotten a little *too* comfy and will keep stomping on any normal boundaries until you get fed up and leave “their” home. 
   
   I’d also encourage the OP to review the household finances, e.g. credit card statements and ATM withdrawals. It often happens that one partner is “loaning” money to their deadbeat sibling, or, as his daughters have no problem stealing, items of value may start disappearing from the home.
   
   Check into your state’s housing laws as well. After a certain period of time, OPs brother-in-law and adult kids may be viewed as tenants, and that’s a whole other can of worms.

   I'm guessing this would prompt OP's wife to echo her brother, that an adult is entitled to spend their own money on expensive makeup but a 16-year-old is entitled to nothing (selectively, because of course the other teens in the house are entitled to whatever, the real issue is that no one in OP's wife's deeply dysfunctional family of origin wants to solve conflict by any mature means, but whatever).
   
   Anyway, this will be cathartic for two seconds, and then it'll inflame the conflict. And to be clear, the conflict *needs* to be inflamed, because BIL sounds like a real psycho and his poor kids are gonna be the same if no one in their environment makes it clear that this behavior isn't normal or tolerable. But maybe that should take the form of OP setting a very clear ultimatum re what treatment of his daughter he will and will not tolerate, and what he's prepared to do to ensure her dignity, rather than anything that might get his wife and BIL bogged down in fighting for the moral high ground.

    ### 171 points by fart_panic

    That's it right there - the mentality that Zoey is entitled to nothing, but everyone around her is entitled to anything of hers that they like.  That's the kind of treatment that sets her up to be a doormat for the rest of her life if she tolerates it and no one stands up for her.

     ### 15 points by MissLadyLlamaDrama

     That's probably how mom grew up.... Which is what is causing this whole situation in thinking that she needs to bend over backwards to make sure to "keep the peace" with her siblings. I'm guessing that her own parents didn't do a whole lot of mediating themselves when the were raising the wife and her brother.
     
     Not that that's an excuse. She's an adult with her own kid now, so she needs to prioritize her kid, and that's on her. But it at least would explain where she gets this idea that telling kids to just tolerate whatever abuse the other kids in the house throw at them, just to minimize the amount of effort that the adults actually have to do by getting involved. Because I'm guessing it didn't come out of nowhere. Her brother was probably the golden child, so she is just accustomed to the concept of having to sacrifice privacy and personal possessions for his benefit. Just now, she is projecting it on to her daughter. And why he seems to think his own kids are entitled to whatever they want.
     
     I hope OP can nip it in the bud before it gets passed on to the poor daughter in this situation.

     What's going on is that now wife has "permission" to be as abusive as she likes. She's probably always leaned towards abuse, but with her brother there she has the support she needs to do whatever she wants to. And she wants to be abusive.

      ### 18 points by LMR0509

      More likely this was what was accepted in her childhood home and she is now facing dealing with it again and she is trying to be the fixer and keep the angry person pacified. She knows her husband and daughter are not going to hurt her but it's pretty obvious how her brother and his children behave. OP mentions her placing a lot of importance on privacy but being uncomfortable with the lock on her daughter's door. I think the mother is caught between a healthier adult life and a more abusive childhood and having her brother there is causing her to revert to old habits. I think the brother is likely far more abusive than OP is aware.

You guys aren't providing a united front on house rules. Your wife js dismissive of your daughters items and privacy in a way she wouldn't be with her own. She's the one letting the house guest manipulate the situation like there doing you a favor by teaching you lessons on sharing everything you own? The silent treatment really? Have you checked your bank accounts? Your housing them (alough the house didn't come with an extra wardrobe and makeup supplies to experiment with). This is a wife problem.  Nex

  Doing what's right is often the hardest thing. Keep at it. 
  
  Also, it may have been said elsewhere but sharing makeup, especially eye make up is a big no no. It can lead to infections or warts so that should be shut down immediately even between the sisters.

   ### 70 points by neverclearone

   Exactly! Styes, pink eye and many more things are transferred between users of make up,  also hair brushes with lice and such.  It is not healthy. This is important and I agree that you should mention to your wife that her behavior is questionable not being on your daughters side. 
   
    I would just have a talk with BIL and remind him he is in your home as a guest and he should be appreciative or you are going to have to part ways,  Being disrespectful to you and your daughter by making a hostile environment in your own home is horrible behavior of grown adults.  I would let him know and your wife that this is a deal breaker and if things don't change they will have to move out immediately, while reminding them it IS A TEMPORARY situation and they should be more concerned with working on getting their own place. Two 18 yr olds and an adult should all be working and able to afford an apartment of their own.

   And re: $15 set from Walmart:
   
   She wanted to have this particular set, she set herself a goal, and she saved up for it. This wasn't just a makeup set to her, but something she had been looking forward to getting and that she had made sacrifices for. She must have been really happy when she brought it home, not because of the makeup, but because she had *achieved* something.  
   To save up for something bigger you're dreaming of is a really important experience, for learning how to manage your finances specifically and also in general. The lesson that someone can just ruin something that is important to you without even having it recognized as having been wronged was an experience she could have done without, but at least she learned that her dad has her back.

  Her cousins are ADULTS.  They're 18. They're old enough to know better.  There are very real consequences for adults who do shit like this.  What are they going to do when they move out into their own apartment with a roommate and the roommate doesn't put up with that sh--?  It sounds like you're teaching not one, but two lessons.  You're teaching your daughter that her space and privacy is valued and disrespecting it won't be tolerated, and you're teaching her cousins that you cannot get away with taking things without people's permission (something that, clearly, they're own parents havent taught them.) 
  
  Odd question: how does _their_ mom feel about this behavior?

  ### 121 points by Contrariwisey

  NTA! You are in the right! Also 60$ makeup is VERY different from 15$ makeup from Walmart. Not even compatible quality. She’s making an investment in quality items. And even if it was 15$ makeup, it would still be her property that they are stealing which is NOT right. Your daughter should be able to keep her things safe. Also, they aren’t borrowing, they are outright stealing. To borrow, you have to ask for permission! Don’t back down. Someone needs to be on your daughters side. Please don’t let her down.

When he came to live with you 10 months ago, was there any talk about how long he would be staying? Because it sounds like he has overstayed his welcome.

  Tell your wife that teaching and providing boundaries and privacy for your daughter now will give her a healthy baseline for the rest of her life. No joke, this is one of the most important things you will ever teach your daughter.
  
  Instead, Zoey's basically being taught that stealing from her is fine, she doesn't deserve to have anything of her own, people can barge in on her without her consent, and standing up for herself results in punishments. What if she has a toxic roommate or significant other someday? She won't be able to see mistreatment because that will be her normal.
  
  The lock is giving Zoey protection and control over her own life. Keep the lock.

  Zoey doesn't feel safe in her own house, your wife needs to realise that. If she wants the lock gone she needs to make sure Zoey can feel safe. And we know what that means. NTA
  
  Zoey is 16 she's a human being with autonomy, not a toy for her cousins to play with as they wish. If she wants to hang out with them she can open the lock. Otherwise all they're missing is the chance to force themselves on her.

  uh yeah Zoey isn't wrong to do that, she's just learnt the only lesson there is to learn from how her cousins are stealing from her and her mother and uncle are ok with that.
  
  It is amazing to me that your wife hears that and doesn't stop to consider for even a moment  'am I in the wrong?' or 'ok maybe how I think things should be doesn't work for my daughter' or the even more important 'oh wow Zoey might really learn to hate her cousins and uncle over this!'

  Your wife and BIL are absolutely in the wrong here.  There is something to be said about kids of a similar age borrowing things from each other.  However, a key part of borrowing another person's belongings is asking that person for permission and if it is okay to use their things.  At no point in this post did I see that the cousins were doing that.  They were just taking her stuff to use as their own.  That isn't borrowing anymore.  That is stealing.  It doesn't matter if they return it later, if they did not have permission from the owner, it is theft.

  Let them be silent. Have Zoey mirror you walking right past them. I was a teenage girl and I've raised a family, and you must show your daughter that it's not her responsibility to bear others injustice against her. Zoey is her own person, not an extention of your wife and if she doesn't receive the respect she deserves in her own home, this will set up a lifetime of her subjugation to others if they are 'mean' to her in any capacity. You wanna watch this happen to her at college and in the corporate world? Of course not. Respect is earned and I'm embarrassed that her mother isn't standing up for her too. It's very sexist of her and her brother to hand you, "teenage girls share things". Bullshit! Walk right past them like they're not there. Gaslighting you both is cruel.

Your BIL and your wife are acting like these two basically adult women get to have say over what your own daughter finds acceptable. It's not cool, and they're acting like giant children.

  You need to explain to your wife that she is completely disregarding Zoey’s feelings and she is sending the message that her nieces and brother’s feelings are more valid and important than her own daughter’s. And since zoey is moving her stuff out already, mom is going to be shocked when she abandons all of you in 2 years. And I would not blame her. Her room should be 1005 off limits unless zoey gives them permission to be in there.

  Very soon Zoey is going to move *herself* out. Your wife thinks her cousins should just be able to steal her stuff (sharing makeup is unhygienic, also, it was HERS) and refuses to take her own daughter’s side? 
  
  You don’t just have a BIL and cousin problem, you have a wife problem.

  NTA. But I’m kinda just hijacking this comment to say - if buying a $15 Walmart make up kid is the solution for your daughter - who spent her own money on this pallet - why isn’t he doing that for his daughters who clearly *need* make up if they’re willing to steal for it?

 Exactly!  As a mother myself I cannot fathom how any mother would let someone treat their child like that, even if it is family. That would have bought them a one way ticket right out my front door. If your kid can't count on you to protect them,  who can they count on? NTA

  As a parent I know I can't stop the world from saying bad things about my children. It breaks my heart but to a certain extent you have to allow it to happen so they learn how to overcome it without being destroyed. 
  
  But the idea of not only giving that person a home but defending them then *attacking* the character of the only person on their side is appalling me. Mom gets no slack cut from me on this one. She should be ashamed of herself. Good on OP.

   I have someone living with me, a very close friend. And he said my 3 year old was "Damion" and "defective" because he was running around like a mad man playing. I very quickly got upset and told him not to ever call my son anything but his name ever again or he'd be living under a bridge.
   
   You're right, as a parent you can't stop people from saying hurtful things, you can't protect them from everything, but I can protect him in his own home, and make sure the people around him who "care" aren't filling his head with garbage like that. Being a parent is tough but I couldn't imagine not sticking up for my own kids.

   >	She isn’t your wife, she’s his sister.
   
   This times a million.  She should always side with her brother over her husband because, well he’s her brother. 
   
   However, this isn’t that. She’s siding with her brother over her daughter. That’s a HUGE red flag in my book. 
   
   My wife and I got into an argument over our daughter once. Her mom wanted to take her somewhere that I objected to. She told me she didn’t want to make her mom made and, I quote, “it’s not up to you”. 
   
   I told her that I would no longer allow her mom to have more input in our relationship than I do. I also told her that If our daughter went there would be consequences. She sent her with her mom to Florida for 8 weeks. During the pandemic. Her birthday was on week 2. 
   
   So while they were gone I got a bunch of odd ball jobs done around the house. Fixed my car. Did things I couldn’t with the kids there and just lived my life. 
   
   On week 5 I told her we had an appointment to go to counseling or I wanted her to move out and I would file a restraining order on her mom. 
   
   When she told me I couldn’t do that and that I was family I reminded her we are family on paper, that can be changed.
   
   Children are blood related, husband and wives are not.

  ### 149 points by MarquisEXB

  Honestly I can understand why the wife would act that way. (Not that I agree condone it.)
  
  My guess is the wife comes from an abusive (mentally) family where she doesn't value her own worth. It's likely the family is misogynistic, where women are to put their needs aside for the men. This would make a lot of sense given how she's devaluing her own daughter.
  
  Family upbringing band bonds can really mess with a person, and that's clearly what's happening here.

  THIS! I asked my dad to stick up for me one time at this business that I knew was taking advantage of me (I was young at the time). My dad was to busy to be bothered. And I ended up feeling humiliated and stupid. I’ve never forgotten that. 😞After that I never counted on him for anything and never asked him for help again with stuff like that. 
  
  You know who has ALWAYS stood up for me? My boss. Yup she’s a strong independent divorced woman and she’s always been there for me. She’s become like my second mother to me. Pretty sad if you can’t count on your own parents to protect you when you’re not an adult and have no power against adults. So yes, OP please continue to stand up for her and for what’s right. She may not remember this incident later but she will remember it if it ends up being a horrible experience. This is a simple situation of - would you like it done to you? (someone one using your stuff without asking and abusing it). I basically grew up thinking you can’t count on any man to stand up for you. Positive side is I’ve never been disappointed after that because my expectations are zero.

 ### 439 points by attanai

 Exactly. OP has one job, and that's to protect his daughter. Everyone else in this situation is an adult or has someone else protecting them. If she doesn't feel dafe in her own home, OP has a right and responsibility to get her out of that situation. I wouldn't go straight for divorce, here, but it would be a wake up call for everyone involved if OP and his daughter moved out of the house for a little while. He can change rent if money is an issue, but either way, his first priority needs to be getting her out of that situation.
 
 Of course, the ideal would be getting the brother to move out, but it sounds like that's not the real issue anymore - this fight will continue long after the brother is gone. It's about trust, now. OP can't trust his wife to keep his daughter safe, and that's not going to change if the brother and his kids are no longer a threat. There will be other threats.

 Quite frankly, as far as makeup goes, Mac isn't even close to the most expensive. It's actually a really great brand for someone who's in their teens and looking to move past drug store brands. My first higher brand makeup kit was from Mac that my mom got me when I was like 13/14.

 OP is offering a huge favour and service to this BIL, something other close family don't seem willing to do and yet he has the audacity to talk that way about him or his daughter...I don't understand sooo many people anymore, entitled assholes is a basic description for them. 
 
 A child's room in their parent's house is THEIR safe space, it should be sacred and a place they know they can create their own boundaries, having a parent shit on that for the sake of her brother's feelings is depressing, this girl will grow to know mommy doesn't have her back or care about her feelings...at least Daddy (OP) has some common sense in this regard, fair play to that guy.

Your daughter doesn’t feel like she has any privacy or respect in her own home and you gave her a lock to give her back her privacy. You tried talking to your wife, your BiL and your nieces and that got you nowhere - if your daughter has to accept 3 additional adults living in her home, they need to accept her very reasonable boundaries of not taking and ruining her things. 

Good for you showing your daughter you respect and support her.

   ### 890 points by AromaticPersimmon0

   the way the OP described how the colors were ruined i can take a pretty good guess it was probably a face or lip palette (most likely cream) because eyeshadow would be an easy fix. if it is cream (which is probably is) there’s no fixing those colors once you mix them in the palette.
   
   EDIT: i’m pretty positive it’s a lip palette or some sort of cream pro palette from MAC. either way VERY expensive and high quality product that i wouldn’t even touch with the decent makeup skills i have as an adult.

    ### 208 points by amyhenderson_

    Good point - I see palette and think eyeshadow, but yeah … I even own more than one non-eye palette, I just assumed! lol Still gross using anyone’s makeup without sanitizing it which I doubt the cousins did - I may share a powder blush or powder highlighter with my sister or a friend (with their own clean brushes), but even cream face products or any lip products are not shareable IMO. Or Zoey may not know how to fix a powder product that got messed up - if it is powder, maybe some YouTube videos could help her fix it? Or it’s just ruined in her eyes even if it is fixable because she saved up and bought something nice for herself and her cousins thoughtlessly gunked it up.

His daughthers are in fact thieves because there's a thin line in between stealing and borrowing and that is our bestie CONSENT.

His daughters don't ask yours for permission on whether they can take something from her or not. They help themselves into her room, into her cabinets/closet, take whatever they feel entilted to, use it however they want even if they drestroy it and then IF SO your daughter might see the object they stole from her again.

You are being an amazing parent and Zoey will forever be grateful for having her back the way a parent should. Whereas, your wife... I don't know if it's the fact that those are her brother's daughters or if she just doesn't care about people getting through her daguther at whatever cost just to steal her property and damage it.

 Exactly what I thought. If Zoey didn‘t give consent, it‘s stealing. And her mother is teaching her, she‘s worthless and that her own needs for privacy, boundaries and respect are just as worthless as she is. If her mother doesn‘t change radically, this poor girl will end in a abusive relationship, being treated like shit because in her mind she isn‘t worth any more than this and she has no mother on her side protecting her. I can even imagine, as a girl (because I experienced it myself like so many other women out there) to be pressurized to have sex or something sexual and not wanting it and being forced to. A person with no self-esteem will let it happen and will keep silence, because in her mind, there will be no support and she‘s worth nothing anyway… The damage this mother is doing is truly huge.

Good on you for standing up for your daughter, your wife, BIL, and his daughters are TA

Your wife’s arguement that this is preventing them from “spending time” with her is completely invalid, they go into her room **when she isn’t there** and take her stuff. Besides, they can “spend time” together in the living room or wherever else

Your BIL is ignorant, MAC vs Walmart has no comparison. Calling your daughter a “defect” is rich from a man who’s adult daughter’s steal from a child. Perhaps he should fix this “defect” in their personalities

Stand your ground, this means so much to your daughter, you cannot fathom. Wife needs to stop enabling BIL/cousins bad behavior, she’s essentially picking them over her own husband and daughter, but I’m certain she doesn’t see that

 To add to that, it sounds like OP put a built in lock on her door so she and OP can access the room with a key. If that's the case, that means Zoey can have then in to spend time whenever she is home, if she so chooses. The lock is there to prevent them from getting in when the room is unoccupied or Zoey needs her privacy. Things a door without a lock should do on their own with decent people.

I think you need to think ahead with this situation. You are your daughter are already uncomfortable in your own home. Your wife is upset. You need to do what is right for your immediate family before it puts even more strain on your relationship.

I think you need to get them to leave before it gets worse. It doesnt take much imagination to see how it could.

How uncomfortable do you have to be in your own home before something snaps? This is not a tenable situation. You have a right to feel safe /comfortable in your own home and anyone that militates against that is playing a dangerous game.

 His wife is upset because he put a lock on his daughter's room. How do you think she will react if he kicks her brother out? 
 
 If he even can, his wife most likely has the same claim to their house as he does, and they're already living here. What happens if you tell them to move out and they just say no? Police isn't going to do shit in most place, at best you'd need to go through the eviction process, and that's even if he's allowed to do that because, again, probably not only his house.

 How would OP treat one of his adult kids if they repeatedly stole from his other kids? Throw them out, perhaps? Or start charging them rent (and increase it to pay for damages and stolen items)? No treats or privileges in the house until they improve their behavior? Loads of fun stuff you could do.

NTA. As someone who had a “family friend” move into our house “temporarily” when I was in middle school. You did the right thing. The “family friend” who moved in with us, was only supposed to be there temporarily, until he got himself an apartment. Lived with us for 4 years. He only moved out because my parents eventually separated and divorced, while he was still living with us. So for the last 4 years that my family, was a family, we had some guy, who my sister and I didnt even like, live in our home.

 I wholeheartedly agree, I mean this incident alone has already started a rift between then, especially with this whole "silent treatment" business. 
 
 
 It is definitely time to start conversations on the BIL and his daughters moving on, think about it if OP and his wife did divorce, it's no skin off the BIL's nose and he'll probably get a larger slice of the house he's mooching off, so he's fine to act in a childish and disruptive manner and not care for the consequences, and I'm not saying that he's doing it on purpose, it's just that he's got no duty of care to OP's marriage, whichi is probably more dangerous than the BIL just being out right against it. I'm not saying kick them out right now, but definitely start making moves and starting serious conversations on the matter because if they're behaving like this over privacy, it can only slowly get worse as more divisions are created later on.

Leaving the palette on the bed and not giving a shit later tells me they really didn't care and had no empathy for Zoe at all.

The cousins are not your daughters and you don’t owe any of them the right to take, use, and destroy any of your family’s belongings. Hopefully they will take the hint and leave as soon as possible. But you did nothing wrong and I hope eventually your wife will understand that.

 Yep. What's not mentioned at all in "I got Zoey a lock", and "she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door" is this: _what does Zoey want?_
 
 OP should not be dictating when the lock comes off, at all. The lock on Zoey's room should stay as long as Zoey wants it to. She's old enough to have this _agency_, this control over her own privacy. It should not be anyone else's choice. 
 
 Or she could just stop locking the room when that's what she feels is right.

  While this is likely true, my sisters and I grew up in a house where most doors didn't have locks, and we weren't allowed to lock the ones that did.

But not for just playing or sleeping.

NTA.  Evict her brother.  Your wife can leave with them.  You need to protect Zoey.  

1. Your wife is T A for continuously dismissing Zoey’s feelings and letting Zoey be hurt repeatedly.  Your wife is choosing her brother over Zoey.  She’s also enabling the cousins’ behaviour by having no repercussions for their STEALING.  Your wife is destroying Zoey’s mental health and their relationship.

2. BIL is T A.  He’s selfish, entitled, and a bully.  It’s obvious why no one would take him in.  He puts his feelings above everyone else’s and enables his daughter’s stealing.  He’s a bad parent and uncle.

3. The cousins are T A for stealing and then throwing a fit when they can’t steal anymore.  They are not borrowing.  They are stealing and destroying property.

Please do the following:

1. Tell Zoey you love her, support her, and will keep her safe.

2. Tell her that her Mom, uncle, and cousins are all the wrong and that she did nothing to deserve this behaviour.

3. Tell Zoey that her privacy matters and she is right not to give her cousins anything that they want.

4. Tell Zoey that you’re going to leave the house with her or kick out BIL.  Either way, you’re going to keep her away from them.

5. Tell her how proud you are of her working and saving for her makeup.  Surprise with a gift card so she buy a new and some more.  

6. Get her counseling.  Most of all, her Mom turning her back on her when she needs her the most is going to be hurting Zoey the most.  A counselor needs to help her heal.

Your nieces are thieves and bullies. Your wife is a shitty mother.

NTA. I grew up in a household where my sister stole constantly from my room and tbh, it might seem minor, but it (among other things) has affected me in life. I wish I had a father who was proactive enough to do this to stop the behavior. Firmly with you on the lock stays until they go. Your daughter will appreciate what you’ve done so much! It gives her peace of mind and her own safe space.

NTA, your nieces are invading your daughters privacy and are taking her stuff. I understand people saying things are developmentally normal throughout childhood, but if you consistently use it as an excuse for wrongdoings, then it’s wrong. On a side note, do the twins share everything? That might be an explanation of why the keep using your daughters stuff, as it might be the norm.

Nope, I definitely feel you're more or less in the right here.  Borrowing stuff without permission is not borrowing.   Especially when the opposite party has expressed that they don't not want to lend something out.  Plus people deserve their privacy, it doesn't matter if their a boy or girl.

When you take someone's belongings without their permission, that's called stealing. Not borrowing. Maybe print that out on a large sign and give it to your BIL and his daughters. Actually, give that to your wife too.

The whole girls of that age do these things is bs. Girls of that age who give each other permission may do those things, but pretty sure that's when it's okay from the person who actually owns those things. Your daughter has made it clear she does not want to and everyone needs to respect that.

Your wife needs to start thinking about your daughter's feeling instead of of just her brother and  nieces. She definitely needs to stop throwing out the family card and how others will dislike you. You are already doing more than anyone else would so if anyone says anything, they are welcome to welcome the BIL and his daughter's into their home.

Your BIL and his nieces need to appreciate that you are letting them stay at your house when others would not and get their heads out of their proverbial behinds. If not, they can give you the silent treatment while living somewhere else. He also needs to stick to parenting his own kids instead of passing some bs judgment on to your parenting and your daughter when it's his daughters who can't respect someone else's privacy and property. 

You and your daughter are doing enough by simply not demanding the BIL and his daughter's get out and instead simply getting a lock for her room. You may want to also figure out how you would even be able to actually kick them out depending on the law's where you are.

NTA, but all others in this story (sans Zoey) are. It is her home where she is supposed to feel safe and you should not feel compelled to treat your nieces as good as your daughters while your wife treats them better than her daughter.

I presume you know the proverb "your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on my part"? Well, a discomfort at how she is treated in her own home DOES and SHOULD constitute a reason to kick your BIL and his daughters to the curb on you and her mothers part. These people are done a huge favor on your part and behave like entitled goblins.

Your daughter has every right to be upset, thank you for listening to her and doing something about it. It's your nieces that are spoiled and entitled brats.

I would say that this is not quite the right idea. I would say that this lock does not get removed _til Zoe wants it removed_. Not before then, and not after.
 This might be the same time, but it's a difference in intent.

Her room, Her choice. She might not make the right choice, but she's old enough to make it and learn from it.

> I got Zoey a lock 

It is not clear from this what Zoe wanted? You don't say anything about that at all. Was it her idea, or did she agree to your idea? What were her wishes, you don't mention them?

NTA.

Also, taking without permission without someone's consent and against their wishes is not "borrowing". Again permission, consent, is Zoe's to give, or not.  _Everyone_ seems to be forgetting that.

 ### 15 points by throwawaylovesCAKE

 Its called being the adult. Zoey is young and might not be aware that what they call borrowing is actually full fledged stealing. So yes, I'd keep the lock on her door to stop the daughters from stealing her things whether Zoey wants me to or not. Sometimes you gotta do things your children dont like, this isnt being controlling, this is showing them how to not let people walk all over them
 
 Plus half the stuff in her room was probably bought by him, so it's also in his interest to not let it get thieved

  ### 9 points by [deleted]

  It’s even worse when you consider that the supposed “adults” are calling it borrowing. Two 18 year olds taking something from a 16 year old without asking? Even if they returned the makeup in perfect condition there was no consent. No wonder those girls are messed up, the fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Hell, if they're 18 then they can get their own jobs and buy their own shit. What they are doing isn't sharing, they aren't asking to borrow you daughter's things, they are taking them without permission, they are stealing.

Your daughter is absolutely going to remember all of this and if she has any sense she will never trust her mother again for the rest of her life because your wife has proven to your daughter that she will pick other people over her.

You should tell you wife that BIL and kids are no longer welcome in your house and if she doesn't like it she needs to leave too.

Edit - Your daughter should report every theft to the police.

### 14 points by GraciePuppers

Taking anything, from anyone, without permission is theft. It's a very simple concept. Both BIL and his girls' have no respect for anyone other than themselves if they think this behavior is ok. 

Offer your wife and her family a choice. The next time something is "borrowed" without permission you'll file a police report, or the lock stays. The ball is in their court at that point.

Edited to add: NTA

You're a good dad, trying to protect your daughter.

Nieces, BIL, and also, sadly, the wife of OP, are the AHs.

This particularly sticks in my craw:

''my wife shamed me....saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters..."

Why?

They are not his daughters. I think people often go wrong by starting with a proposition that isn't true, but, supposedly, under some ideal set of conditions, perhaps should be true. This isn't even a "blended family"/step sibling situation, so why the conflation?

These girls are his nieces, not his daughters, and the fact that they are now living in his house doesn't change that. OP and his wife do not have the responsiblity for raising these girls, BIL does. And OP and wife don't have the authority that goes with that, either. Perhaps, if all three girls WERE sisters, OP and wife could find some other way to deal with this, that doesn't involve locking doors against theft within a household. But OP and his wife really have only indirect authority over the nieces, through the BIL, if at all. And given the attitude of BIL, even that is dubious.

The girls should be treated exactly as what they are. Cousins that are staying at the house, most likely on a temporary basis. They should be treated with respect, of course, but it is not disrespectful to lock them out of a room from which they are habitually stealing, apparently with their father's OK. Really, as the OP makes clear in his last par, they, and BIL, are lucky this is all that he is doing.

### 12 points by BookReader1328

NTA - But your problem is with your wife. Your BIL shouldn't have any opinion at all about how you run the house he's currently living in for free. I highly suggest you kick them out, and if your wife has a problem with that, I suggest she go with them. And that is not "teen stuff." It's people with zero morals/ethics/standards stuff. Not what I'd want around my daughter.

You are awesome giving your daughter privacy, and your BIL has some major balls coming into your home, demanding things, and disrespecting your parenting as he spoils his brats. No wonder he’s divorced, sounds like a pill.

### 10 points by melympia

Okay, so I see several issues here. And you're NTA in all of them.

* Regarding the lock, you absolutely did the right thing for getting it, and you're doing the right thing in making sure it stays there.
* Regarding the lock part 2 and your nieces now being unable to spend time with your daughter (according to your wife), I presume the lock is only locked when Zoey is out of her room? So, how does your nieces ability to enter your daughter's room when she's not there impact their ability to spend time with her? Not at all, that's how much. Your wife is an AH for trying to blame-shifting here. But then, blame-shifting and victim-blaming seem to run in the family, don't they? Because that's what your BIL did by declaring your daughter shouldn't have the make-up in the first place that his daughter ruined.
* Regarding not having your wife's back, you're still doing the right thing. Because she should have her daughter's back, which you do. She's clearly in the wrong here. However, you need to have a serious talk with your wife. About how badly your BIL's and nieces' presence in your home impacts you, your daughter, and your relationship with your wife. I mean, her giving you and your daughter the silent treatment for protecting her(self) and her belongings is very high up there in the realms of unreasonalbe, if not toxic.
* If your wife stays unreasonable and "upset" with you, I'd seriously suggest that you make sure your nieces know where your wife keeps her make-up, her jewellery, phone cases and whatever else they may be interested in. I'm pretty sure she'll sing a different tune pretty quickly. Especially if you make sure she can't use your common money (household money or the like), but only her personal spending money to replace the stuff your nieces steal/destroy.

### 10 points by [deleted]

NTA at all.  I grew up with sisters that stole and destroyed everything I owned.  I went a whole New England winter without boots because one sister had stolen mine and was hiding them in her school locker.  I’d walk in their room and my cd’s would be snapped in half on their floor.  Their friends would come over wearing my clothes... after they had modified them by cutting off the hood or something.  Etc etc but tell your wife:  I no longer talk to my sisters or my parents.  Just my side of things.  Even if I liked them I wouldn’t be able to afford the losses of their unmitigated assholery.

They aren’t borrowing and they absolutely know it’s wrong. They have no respect for your daughter or her belongings.  There’s nothing wrong with your daughter to save up for something she wants.  It’s also pretty gross using someone else’s makeup.  

I’d expect the two eighteen year olds to pay for Mac kit they destroyed and to tell your brother in law the demand is coming from you, not your daughter.  

Don’t remove that lock!  Also might want to get a locking makeup bag for your daughter.

NTA...I feel bad for your daughter.  BIL and nieces have no respect for you, your daughter or your property.  Shows lack of parenting if they don't understand boundaries of other people's property.

So sorry you have to deal with this.  It also sounds like the twins are jealous of what your daughter has.

Have the same conversation with your wife again, without anger and when emotions are slightly cooled.  She needs to realize that **she can't expect a 16 yo to switch gears from being an 'only' to having her space invaded and accept cousins as instant siblings.** Remind her that her standing up for his kids over her OWN CHILD will haunt/hurt their relationship.  She needs to see things thru her daughter's eyes - not thru the eyes of her sibling.  (she may have some weird feelings of protectiveness if she's older or want his approval if she's younger).   Tell her if she doesn't become her daughter's advocate, SHE is making the choice for BIL to leave.   

Maybe even do some sleuthing - find out specifically why other family wouldn't take him in...or ask your MIL/FIL for additional perspective to bolster the discussion.

I don’t know why us girls to though a stealing phase (super common) but it’s horrible when they do it to people that are their family or friends they’re supposed to care about. Keep the lock on Zoeys door and don’t back down when it comes to standing up for her! These other girls need to learn stealing is wrong, they’re not “borrowing” if they’re just barging in and taking her stuff! What audacity.

### 6 points by Special-Parsnip9057

NTA!!!Why is it that people are so willing to look the other way on bad behavior? Your wife really ought to be ashamed of herself for not advocating for HER daughter instead of her brother's daughters.

Let's get one thing straight. You both allowed 3 ADULTS  to move into your home. Your wife needs to understand that.  You say that other family members wouldn't help and so now you're stuck in a bad situation.  Did anyone ask your daughter how SHE would feel about this? Because clearly your wife, uncle and her cousins don't seem to care how she feels about her things being ruined and taken since they did.  Instead, they are willing dismiss the cousin's behavior because "that's girl stuff" or the makeup kit she saved for "is too expensive and adult" for her.  Well, apparently it wasn't too adult for his adult daughters to ruin.  In some places this is grounds for arrest too. Your daughter is a minor and they aren't.  And they are taking and destroying her things.

I would have a come to Jesus conversation with your wife.  I would indicate that you know she wants to help her brother and his kids, but she is forgetting that her priority is her own daughter.  Her taking sides and defending them is damaging her relationship with her own child because she has been bearing the brunt of their bad behavior.  She is allowing 3 ADULTS to bully and demean HER CHILD because she is so invested in her need to help her brother. And, you need to work on a plan and a timeline as to when they all need to get out.  Unless things change drastically, they are GUESTS in your home and they should act like it. And you are perfectly within your rights to send them packing if they can't shape up.

I am honestly appalled at your wife's behavior. She seems to think nothing of your daughter's feelings and disappointment and wants you to think of her cousins as YOUR daughters. Well, do that then. Make them buy a new kit for your daughter. Hold them accountable to their behavior and mete out discipline when warranted.  If they don't like it and don't comply, and keep wreaking havoc, get eviction papers ready for the girls and your BIL. Keep records of everything with dates and times in case you need it.  If anything else goes missing or other types of behavior like you've described occurs, see if you can press charges. And if you get them out of the house, change the locks.

I don't know the circumstance that prevents your BIL from being able to at least find his own apartment for him and the daughters, but I strongly suggest this be made part of the conversation as well.  Moving in  cannot be the long-term and permanent solution for his issues. u/OnlyInQuebec9

"Borrowing" without permission is stealing.  Technically, Sammy's daughters ARE thieves. Sammy is enabling them, and deflecting his enabling and their entitlement onto you.

Bravo, OP, for standing up for Zoey when all the other adults in the house won't.  WTH is with your wife, BTW? It seems that her family already knows what's up with Sammy's family, and that's why they won't put them up.

Also, he should stop pretending he knows anything about makeup either, because it's actually kind of easier to apply "natural" looking makeup with nicer makeup than it is with cheaper makeup, so his logic makes no sense. He implies you are letting your daughter look older than she is for "untoward" reasons (sense the sarcasm), but nicer makeup isn't gonna make her "look older" (except maybe in the sense that she might look like a more experienced makeup artist when she has nicer and easier to use products)

Why doesn't your BIL go buy his daughters the $15 one from Walmart then? And ASKING for permission is the difference between borrowing or stealing. They don't ask, they just take, it's stealing. If I were you I'd start doing that to my partners stuff. Just ruin her things, take them, hide them etc. TBH as soon the BIL said that about my daughter after his daughters clearly have the defect he would be out of the house.

Tell your wife you are going to look for an apartment for you and your daughter. Explain that she's chosen her brother and his children over Zoey's privacy and feelings, and that as soon as you move out, she can do what she wants with the lock on the door.

Tell her you are not prepared to suffer the silent treatment in your own home, and you'll contact her as soon as you move out to discuss her paying you child support.

See how long she is prepared to back her nieces up then

NTA.  Please continue to protect Zoey.  Feel so bad for your daughter.  I remember saving up for special things.  Honestly, it taught me to really think about a want and a need and how to work for them.   I'm a great saver now because I learned early to do so and take care of my things.  Plus your daughter is a single child (from what I understand).  How horrible for her to have rude and disrespectful relatives invade her safe space - home and room - and own mother not stand up for her.  Your daughter is being put out in more ways than one.  Stand your ground.

Yes, girls do share things AFTER ASKING PERMISSION. Jerk sisters, cousins, friends don't. Especially expensive makeup. That is a hygiene thing too. You're not supposed to share any makeup. I would make them pay for a new set. Your wife and BIL obviously grew up with no respect for people's things or boundaries. This is all on them. I'm guessing they are rent/bill free too, which makes their behavior even more atrocious. If no one on their side took them in, there is reason. Probably because they are disrespectful and "takers". Fuck them. Give them a due date to move out. Ten months rent/bill free is plenty of time to get their shit together. Does he have a job? Time for him to move the fuck on. You're not the asshole here. Your wife needs to be respectful for you and your daughter.

NTA. This is only “normal” behavior when all people involved agree that it is okay. Zoey obviously does not think this is okay, and she has every right to feel that she AND her belongings are safe and respected in her own home. You seem to be the only one respecting that. She deserves safety and privacy. If you want to try to smooth the whole issue over, simply focus on the fact that she deserves privacy, period. Let Zoey have her own voice and let her say she also wants the lock on her door, if she feels comfortable doing that. I don’t know how to make your wife understand, but your BIL and his daughters don’t need to. You don’t have to explain anything to them, you don’t owe them an explanation. You have done the right thing, end of story. 

Edited to add, just in case it matters that I am not also a teenager, I’m a 44f mother of two 20-somethings. They always had locks on their doors growing up. Not on purpose, just because that’s the way our house was, but they were allowed to lock their doors, and they were always allowed to CHOOSE who they wanted to share with and WHAT they wanted to share. I always refused to play that “you have to share with everyone” bullshit. That is not respecting your children’s agency. They are people, not property.

NTA -- Kids learn very quickly that if x, then y. Your daughter learned that if she has a nice thing in her private space, her space is no longer private and secure enough to trust leaving them. 

Sloane is 18. If/when she has a roommate in the future and she tries this, she is going to have a HELL of a rude awakening. She needs to learn that asking before using anyone else's belongings or going into another person's is BARE MINIMUM. Otherwise it's theft, vandalism, and tresspassing. 

Backing down or giving an inch will tell your daughter that she can't trust you. She already doesn't trust the rest of your family, if she's hiding stuff elsewhere. Please keep backing her up.

Your daughter should always come first and her cousins have their own father and you dont need to play that role for them.

NTA. You’re such a great father for paying attention to how Zoey feels and supporting her throughout all of this. Everybody deserves their own privacy, and Zoey’s cousins are oblivious to that. What they need is to be taught that taking things without asking is stealing and not borrowing.

Remind everyone, kindly, that Zoey and the twins have not yet established the kind of relationship where they share everything. And maybe they will, maybe they won't either way it's ok. They were not raised together for the last 16 years. This is new for everyone and finding compromises is important for everyone.

The twins grew up sharing everything, your wife and her brother and whatever other siblings they have also likely grew up having to share a lot. Zoey grew up not having to share anything, it sounds like she is an only child. Again there is a place here for both sides to compromise, it is an important life skill.

This whole situation is new for everyone and it takes time to find the right balance. This is a blended family situation and it takes time and effort by everyone to make it work.

Your wife needs to see that there is a difference between how she was raised and how you both are raising your daughter. Also, why should you treat adult nieces that you didn't have any raise or influence over as your own? 

Your (AH) BIL needs to see the same and also not insult your daughter! In the same breath he said both she's too young for nice makeup and the same age as his daughters so she shouldn't be upset. Pick one, and also STFU. 

Your daughter has boundaries, you are helping her maintain them with a lock. Sometimes that is what is necessary. It gives her the option to spend time with her cousins or not, and feel that she has control over when that is.  I'm sure Zoey really appreciates that you are on her side and that you understand that this whole situation is difficult for her.

 No one would be told that it's ok to let people take from you or ignore your limits. Even family.

### 5 points by jessenby

NTA AT ALL.

This is NOT normal teenage girl behavior. This is disrespectful brat behavior. I would NEVER have gone into my own sister’s room, much less a cousin, and taken her things. These two are legal adults yet everyone around them refuses to teach them to respect other people’s boundaries and valuables. 

Your daughter should by cheap, low quality make up because Sammy’s daughters are disrespectful, selfish jerks who ruined Zoey’s things? Um. No. Sloane owes Zoey $60 and owes you for the price of the lock you were FORCED to install. I can’t even imagine using someone’s m.a.c. palette without permission, much less mixing colors on it. Best case scenario Zoey can scrap the top layer off and salvage the underneath but she’s totally right, Sloane damaged it significantly because now all of the colors will smudge and turn shades of brown. I would lose it if someone did that to my palettes. It’s so rude. 

Teenage girls borrow things with -permission-. They -ask first-. It’s a running thing in books and shows and films that teens and 20somethings who borrow items without permission are being rude and it makes them unpopular with their peers precisely because it’s Bad To Do That. The fact that Sammy and his ex didn’t teach their children to be upstanding humans with basic decency isn’t your fault or Zoey’s.

 Your wife needs to consider whether being a mother or an aunt is more important to her because the way you both handle this moment will be ingrained in Zoey’s mind forever - she’ll remember that you defended her autonomy and privacy and that mom said it’s fine for people to invade her space and take her things. That is going to be something that she recalls all through her life because how you act is more meaningful than what you say. Mom is encouraging Zoey to tolerate people making her feel unsafe and uncomfortable and that is a terrible thing to teach a child. It impacts their entire self perception at that age, it tells them that friends and partners who take what they want without permission are the normal ones and she’s the one who is wrong for wanting to set limits. It impacts how easily you cave to peer pressure, how quickly a no is coerced into a yes from a boy/girlfriend in the future. It isn’t just today, with how you both deal with her cousins - it’s how she views her needs and rights regarding her body and her things. Mom may not realize that but you’re teaching Zoey that she can say no to people and mom is teaching her that sometimes people taking from you is just the way life works.

NTA this is a hill to die on. Borrowing requires an agreement from both parties, otherwise it's theft. Also, using someone else's makeup is unhygienic and can lead to infections etc. There is nothing wrong with anyone including a teenager buying high end products that they scrimp and save for. It's their right and teaches them budgeting while giving them the means to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Stick by your daughter , the lock stays! And if they all don't like it,  the next lock they see can be the one that closes after they leave the premises.

I have an abundance of sisters, and when they "borrowed" my shit without asking growing up, they got in trouble. I had a job and saved up and bought myself nice things, and if they touched them without asking, they got grounded and had to replace what they took. I had a pretty shitty childhood, but even my parents respected personal property and stood firm on respecting it, and my siblings and I shared bedrooms, and we all shared one tiny bathroom. 

Your wife and BIL are huge, gaping AHs here. They are defending the shitty behavior of two entitled girls over the completely reasonable request for basic respect from you and your daughter. I genuinely hope your wife sees this and gets a reality check, because what she's doing is not ok. How she's treating her daughter is not ok.

People who behave this way have boundary issues and it is important that your daughter learn that her boundaries are important. Those girls being allowed to go in and steal her stuff is just teaching Zoey that her boundaries don’t matter. You did the right thing and I hope your wife wakes up.

Let's compare what these people say with the actual facts:

1. They say the cousins are not thieves and that it's normal for girls of the same age to borrow each other's stuff. The fact is that borrowing requires consent. Consent was not given, quite explicitly so. That makes it stealing. The cousins *are* thieves.
2. They say Zoey should not buy expensive makeup kits. The fact is what Zoey spends her own money on is none of their business.
3. They say the lock on Zoey's door keeps the cousins from spending time with Zoey. The fact is that the lock keeps them from entering her room when she is not in there.  The fact is that this is not at all about spending time with anyone but about having unrestricted access to Zoey's stuff.
4. They say you are babying Zoey and are overprotective. The fact is that you are exactly the appropriate level of protective while you are harbouring thieves in your house.

All in all, this sounds like a textbook case of gaslighting to me. Instead of accepting blame for being/enabling unapologetically thieving offspring they are trying to shame you for seeing things as they actually are and acting accordingly.  
To be honest, I don't know why you even tolerate any of them in your house, as for me stealing would be an immediate disqualifier, especially given that they are accepting no fault for it. And at this rate this very much includes your wife. You (and Zoey, obviously) are NTA. The rest can pound sand.

But your job as a parent is to stick up for your kids, so keep doing that.  You asked the other girls to stop taking her stuff, and Zoey clearly doesn't want them taking her stuff. Zoey shouldn't be REQUIRED to "spend time" with her cousins, especially if they're taking her things; she deserves to have autonomy and control over her space and belongings. Maybe this is how your wife was with your brother or maybe this is how Sloan & Olivia are, but Zoey is an only child and used to doing things the only child way. They can't force her to suddenly be like them.

I am glad to see that you are defending your daughter and her rights to privacy and to have her own things. Your wife’s insistence on your daughter taking a back seat to her brother and his daughters is troubling. Why are they so upset over a lock?  Is it because they feel entitled to Zoeys time and things and don’t believe they Zoey has a right to decide who she spends time with or who she decides to share her possessions with?  

Your nieces have been taught that no one is allowed to say no to them so this learned entitlement will just get worse. 

You and your wife need a long talk and possibly marital therapy about boundaries and being a united team instead of her putting her brother and his spoiled monsters first.

NTA. Sharing is one thing --but they never asked permission. 

AND YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE EYE MAKEUP. Professional artists (should) clean and sanitize brushes between applications. Sharing eye makeup can cause someone's normal eye bacteria to get in your eyes --and your eyes don't like it at all. Stys, pink eye, and general irritation can occur quickly. 
That's if your daughter WANTED to share. 

The twins are thieves. They are taking her personal belongings. They took her school computer. They ruined her makeup. 

Your daughter doesn't feel like she has privacy or any form of security in her own home. Keep the lock on the door after they move out. She's a teenager *and* deserves privacy and respect. 

As for your wife --tell her if the twins need to share that much, they can borrow her things. See how well that goes over.

You should not view the twins “as daughters”—they are guests in your home and have grossly outstayed their welcome. Teenage girls do not always “borrow” each other’s stuff, not to this extent. It’s not borrowing if you don’t ask. And your BIL deflecting by insulting your parenting and judging what your daughter buys with her savings—that’s just unhelpful and irrelevant. NTA and I hope they leave soon.
