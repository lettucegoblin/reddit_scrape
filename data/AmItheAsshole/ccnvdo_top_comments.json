Of course don't let your parents completely live your life for you but definitely heed their advice, they aren't doing this for the sake of exerting parental control over you, they're doing this because they want you to have a practical and stable future where you're not in loads of debt for a useless degree and nothing to show for all that time and money spent after the fact because art majors aren't in high demand.\n\n If anything you should say fuck going to school and putting yourself in debt until you actually have the slightest idea of who you are and what you enjoy doing with your time cause at 18 you don't know shit about jack shit, you can't even explain why you do what you do half the time but I digress. Take a chill pill and think about what you want to do with your life and actually do some research on potential careers you want to pursue. \n\nAlso you should sit down with your parents and have a discussion instead of running to reddit to feel justification and validation for your actions.\n\nEdit: for everyone insisting that art degrees are super useful, you're terribly misinformed and should rely more on factual and statistical data rather than your \"feelings\" or personal stories about how someone you know made it work for themselves.

It's always okay to reflect a gift that you don't want, especially when it comes with strings attached. Secondly, I think your parents reaction might be a tad assholeish, but generally, they're probably also not assholes. Assholes don't typically offer $10,000 to help with education. More likely, they're just worried and a tad misguided. BFA degrees do have the highest unemployment rate of secondary education degrees at 9.8%. They also have one of the lowest average starting salaries at just over $40k. That's not to say you can't find employment or that it would be useless, but it is definitely choosing a more challenging path through life. I'm going to guess that neither of your parents are BFA degrees, and that they probably know some BFA degrees from when they were in college who are now struggling. They want to protect you from that because they're your parents, however they went about it poorly.\n\nIf you want support from your parents, sit them down and have an honest conversation with them. Explain to them that you understand the challenges that come with a BFA, and you have a financial plan for dealing with the immense student debt that comes with attending a top tier University. I'm going to guess that the schools you're looking at are out of state schools where as your parents would prefer you go in state. This can literally be a difference if graduating with $25k-$35k in student debt and graduating with $200k in student debt. With a degree where the average graduating salary is so low, that can be crippling. At a 5% interest rate, that could literally be $10,000/year in just interest payments alone, not even toughing the debt. \n\nI'm not telling you that you shouldn't pursue your dreams or that you should cave to your parents demands, but when the cost of an apartment alone can be as high as $36k / year depending on where you live, these are all things you should think about and consider what you want for your future.\n\nOverall, my opinion is NAH. Have the conversation with your parents about what you want and what the realities of achieving that are.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people talking about the value of a portfolio.

I highly reccommend it if you love art, it was a tough decision for me, but it was the best one. I hope to get my master's and teach at the college level eventually. It may not work out that way, but I'm doing what I love and I feel like I made the best decision for myself. \n\n$10,000 is a lot, but it isn't going to cover all of your schooling. It'll make a nice dent in it, but if you get stuck in a field you hate, your life WILL be affected by it. If you choose to pay your own way, you can look into community colleges (if you have any) with art programs. Many of them have direct transfer degrees that go to a university and will let you transfer smoothly. It'll be a great way to get your gen ed's for half the cost, and some of my favorite people in life were my CC instructors. My CC also had waaaay more resources than my current university, so keep that in mind as well as you tour departments. I had access to a lot of different classes, materials and other resources that are not available where I'm at now. There are also less instructors and less variety in what's being taught. I mainly do ceramics and painting, so it's not too bad for me, and I got to experiment a ton in CC because of the variety. I wouldn't love ceramics the way I do now if I hadn't started there. You also have a lot more room to make mistakes and take weird classes. \n\nThe biggest change here is that CC usually doesnt have housing, however it also means that if you transfer, you'll get to university as a Junior, and won't have to live in student housing at all. It can be a great way to get away from home and make friends, but it's RIDICULOUSLY expensive compared to renting off campus, and the quality of the dorms varies greatly.\n\nIf art is your thing, start thinking about what field youd like to work in bow, as itll help you make decisions towards that goal. If you want to be an art teacher for kids, you have to have a teaching degree in the US to do so, which means teaching certification. But if you want to teach college, you go through the regular art courses, and then apply for a master's program. If you want to get a bachelor's, and just make art as a professional artist, you can apply to all sorts of programs and art residencies that are solely there to give you a space and possibly a community to make art in\n\nIf community college is an option, you could try to bring that up to your parents. It could be a way to stay closer to home while studying what YOU want to study, and could be a good compromise while you dip your toes into college. You could convince them that it'll let you find out if art is right for you, while also doing a lot of the important gen ed's you need for ANY field. Your first two years of college tend to be mostly gen ed classes regardless of where you go, but I found that CC let's you take extra classes. You can also look at the differences between degrees. An AA might look really good to your parents, but itll let you take a lot of art classes. You can also look at the AFA which might let you take more art classes. It also determins how you transfer over to university.\n\nAnd, if you are in the US, than remember that your parents only get access to your information IF you sign for them to have it. You have to opt into it, and legally, if you don't sign those waivers, they are not allowed to access your grades or your classes, and most importantly, your financial aid information. Legally, your professors cannot confirm that you are a student, what your grades are, anything. Even if your parents mean well, it could be a good way to set boundaries as you start taking on life as an adult.\n\nIf you have any questions about art, school or adulting in general, feel free to PM me! I hope things can be resolved easily, and that your parents are open to working with you on the path YOU choose.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d say your NTA. (I&#39;m in the US so everything I mention is based on that, if you aren&#39;t in America, it may be different for you) </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m getting my BFA in art. I highly reccommend it if you love art, it was a tough decision for me, but it was the best one. I hope to get my master&#39;s and teach at the college level eventually. It may not work out that way, but I&#39;m doing what I love and I feel like I made the best decision for myself. </p>\n\n<p>$10,000 is a lot, but it isn&#39;t going to cover all of your schooling. It&#39;ll make a nice dent in it, but if you get stuck in a field you hate, your life WILL be affected by it. If you choose to pay your own way, you can look into community colleges (if you have any) with art programs. Many of them have direct transfer degrees that go to a university and will let you transfer smoothly. It&#39;ll be a great way to get your gen ed&#39;s for half the cost, and some of my favorite people in life were my CC instructors. My CC also had waaaay more resources than my current university, so keep that in mind as well as you tour departments. I had access to a lot of different classes, materials and other resources that are not available where I&#39;m at now. There are also less instructors and less variety in what&#39;s being taught.

I gave up the STEM field knowing full well that I would be making less money but at least I&#39;d be enjoying my life.

        "body": "When I was in high school (a decade ago, which seems crazy), we were all highly, highly discouraged from taking a gap year. I went to a public school with a 97% college rate (granted, this was in Canada).\n\nThe reasons we were advised against gap years:\n\n- you will get too comfortable and won't go to college (well, university as we called it) at all.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI suppose what they were getting at, is that we wouldn't have the discipline to get out of this miserable life we created for ourselves in that one year. And I think that's what you're alluding to as well? \n\nIf so, it is a fair point. Some people just won't go to college at all. Do you think those are the same people who would have thrived in college, or the same people who would have dropped out, or finished just because? Would they have always wanted to be housewives or househusbands? \n\nA lot of my fellow high school graduates went on to never use their degree. A handful took over a family business, another handful just live at home doing nothing, and a surprisingly high (still objectively low, but surprisingly high) number went to a trade school afterward. The rest of this bunch just do whatever work that doesn't require a degree in the first place.\n\nOf course, the majority went on to careers that at least somewhat use their degree. Of those I keep in touch with, many are unhappy with their choice, but it pays the bills. Quite a few of my classmates went to the same school as I after graduating, and far more than I expected cheered me on to quit and transfer when I said I would. They lived vicariously. They wanted to quit, too, but didn't.\n\nI think gap years get a bad rap. You take a year off, and that's it, that's your life now. Or you take a year off, squander some money on traveling to Europe, and you're back where you started.\n\nThat's not what I propose. I hope to sit down with my kids, when they're at that age, and review \"life\". Here's what you can expect to make at this wage. Here's your rent. Here's how taxes work. Here's your cell phone bill, and here's your internet. Where do utility bills come in? Where does fun stuff come in? What's the best way to make this work?\n\nWhat do you want to do? Why? Here's what the student loan payment would be if you went here vs there. What scholarships or grants are there? What do you have to do to get them? Can you trial this? \n\nWhich college is nearby? Have you looked into auditing courses? Which courses? Do you have to register to audit, or can you just show up?\n\nThis isn't to say that things will go down like that. Maybe my kids will be stubborn, maybe they'll be steadfast in their selection, maybe they just won't want to. But from my personal experience, I wish I was told when I was 16 that this was an alternative. I wouldn't have lost two years, and I would've spent my first year out of high school doing what I did in the year after transferring out of college too late.",

The rest of this bunch just do whatever work that doesn&#39;t require a degree in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the majority went on to careers that at least somewhat use their degree. Of those I keep in touch with, many are unhappy with their choice, but it pays the bills. Quite a few of my classmates went to the same school as I after graduating, and far more than I expected cheered me on to quit and transfer when I said I would. They lived vicariously. They wanted to quit, too, but didn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>I think gap years get a bad rap. You take a year off, and that&#39;s it, that&#39;s your life now. Or you take a year off, squander some money on traveling to Europe, and you&#39;re back where you started.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not what I propose. I hope to sit down with my kids, when they&#39;re at that age, and review &quot;life&quot;. Here&#39;s what you can expect to make at this wage. Here&#39;s your rent. Here&#39;s how taxes work. Here&#39;s your cell phone bill, and here&#39;s your internet. Where do utility bills come in? Where does fun stuff come in? What&#39;s the best way to make this work?</p>\n\n<p>What do you want to do? Why? Here&#39;s what the student loan payment would be if you went here vs there. What scholarships or grants are there? What do you have to do to get them? Can you trial this? </p>\n\n<p>Which college is nearby? Have you looked into auditing courses? Which courses? Do you have to register to audit, or can you just show up?</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t to say that things will go down like that. Maybe my kids will be stubborn, maybe they&#39;ll be steadfast in their selection, maybe they just won&#39;t want to. But from my personal experience, I wish I was told when I was 16 that this was an alternative. I wouldn&#39;t have lost two years, and I would&#39;ve spent my first year out of high school doing what I did in the year after transferring out of college too late.</p>\n</div>",

Especially if you're being interviewed by the company HR rep and not by one of your direct engineering supervisors. It's like the person doing the interview is looking for a great conversational buddy, instead of someone qualified for the position. Now don't get me wrong, communication skills are always important, especially for certain work terms.  Sometimes it just feels like they won't hire you unless you have a 90% average or the social skills of an extrovert who runs 3 different clubs.\n\nIf you're outgoing and have great social skills, you're far more likely to get a position. Hell if you're really good at networking you might even be handed jobs. I get that's how it is, but damn if it doesn't feel shitty getting an 85% average and not getting a job offer until the job competition is almost over.

She made me sign away my rights before I saw a doctor because as she told the officer who brought me home with facial bruises and ripped clothing, \u201comg omg what did she do to my car. I need a car. Omg omg omg. Where\u2019s my car.\u201d  I have had health issues all my life but after that accident they became life altering. I  cut ties for 7 years after a counselor told me that basically I had cancer and the only treatment was to cut out that cancer. The father I loved beyond reason  had a stroke and she told me I couldn\u2019t have a relationship with him if I wouldn\u2019t have one with her and still I had no choice. \n\nThen my body gave out and I ran out of options. To keep my pets I had to go back and for  five years she let me \u201cgenerously\u201d live in the basement (upstairs was worse. If I had blinding migraines she would wake me up because I sleep too much. She would bitch if I was suffering and curled up in a ball but I had the tv on because I was \u201cjust watching tv\u201d and could be doing something (for her).the basement offered privacy in small doses until it began taking on water and she refused to address the mold in the 25 year old carpets the damaged ceiling tiles and even the bedroom had no carpet (in frigid winter) but paneled walls. That was my part of the house \u201cand I didnt deserve\u201d repairs.She couldnt \u201cafford\u201d my physical therapist at 2500/year but could but a 10K bathroom remodel because my cousins MIGHT visit and 3000 stained glass windows for her bathroom etc etc. while her disabled daughter was bedridden round the clock\n\nFinally after I said I would rather jump off a bridge than go home my best friend said I\u2019ve been asking for years, shut up or move in. I know you can\u2019t pay,just don\u2019t cost me money. I\u2019ve been here >5 yrs now. Moms now 92 and couldn\u2019t be bothered to read a new trust her broker and my cousin created that lets her be noble and screw me at the same time. I can\u2019t walk today because I can\u2019t get a 3k surgery that Medicare will only cover 1x/yr and I use to get 2.  Still \u201c I should be grateful because i am going to inherit millions\u201d -basically stop being a brat and demanding petty things like walking and wait for me to die. In fact there\u2019s another 5k procedure that may be my best solution but every day that I deteriorate \u201cwaiting\u201d makes me less and  less likely to be a candidate for it to work. So I may get the money and be too late. to put in prospective I could do every single god dam thing on my list medically and comfort wise and even if I included a new car, the pool we are building and hired help for the first year -it would be slightly over 5 percent of the total. truthfully my entire life of needs AND wants other than what I may do were I to get marginally better and my basic on going bills-  -  she could bankroll ALL OF THAT and STILL would have millions -yet she lets her only kid live on food stamps (Ssdi is only 15k) while I suffer in physical pain daily with little help but I\u2019m ungrateful knowing it\u2019s coming.....,\n\nAnd I get it all...eventually...Except not really. The new trust makes them now my warden to protect me from that best friend who has her own money  and doesn\u2019t need to game me out of any inheritance or she would just charge me rent. They call this a narcissists \u201cflying monkeys\u201d.At any point they can deem me irresponsible and cut me off. They call the financial shots and bill the estate As they deem right. They can hire countless staff, take out loans make gifts -even the house my father paid for is a manipulation  -I can have some money from the sale of a 1/2M house or I move back for 6 months and disrupt my life where I am (we r moving) and maybe get it all. I\u2019ll be basically groveling for money that she didn\u2019t earn and that everyone not named me has inherited in full except me, the only one with a college degree and an iq of 140. I\u2019m too stupid and irresponsible and my bestie is hateful  and conniving because no one could really care about me or as mom once admitted because if she hadn\u2019t let me come I\u2019d still be (stuck) in her basement.

We're so done with this shit, we have so much friggin waste because of her. I'm 23 and live with my boyfriend, she comes by at least once a week with stuff no one needs.
