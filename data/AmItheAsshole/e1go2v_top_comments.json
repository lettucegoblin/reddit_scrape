I made plenty of mistakes and the biggest one I made with my older children was failing to discipline myself first. You didn't take the iPods to show them how to interact in a more respectful manner. You didn't even do it because of what they did. It was something hurtful you could do that was lower effort than actually spending the time and effort to work with them teaching them and demonstrating. And worst of all you did it because you had a bad day not because it was the worst of their behavior. If you want to know why they kept doing the same things and didn't improve, that's because you didn't teach them. These are hard facts I learned the hard way, and I am forever sad I did that to my children. They haven't forgotten and it is still hurtful to them to remember it today that I punished them for my bad day, not out of love and care for them trying to help them.\n\nSelling your kids tablets or pretending to sell them is a low effort bullshit punishment. It has nothing to do with the problem you were trying to solve and I promise they'll remember it the rest of their lives as one of the shittiest things you ever did to them.\n\nRegifting them to them as Christmas gifts is even shittier.  The example you are setting is that a lie is ok as long as it furthers your ends. Is that the lesson you want your kids to learn and more importantly remember and emulate in their dealings with you?\n\nHow would you feel if I walked over and took whatever you're posting up on and told you I sold it just because I had a bad day and didn't like something you did? Does my day make it ok for me to be shitty to you and do something to you that has nothing to do with what you did that annoyed me and is more about my own bullshit than anything you did anyways?\n\nYour children deserve respect just as much as you do. You should have taken the time to spend time with them helping them learn to use their words, learn to respect each other, and such. If you were going to punish them, it should have fit the issue. Stuff like having them watch a movie together or do a craft project together are things that helped my two kids learn to work together and get along. Having them work as a team against you in some contest that is age and ability appropriate for the youngest is also a great idea. And the best idea yet is that you catch them doing well and give them back their iPods as reward.\n\nLook, I get that you probably had parents who parented you like you are doing your kids. How did you like that, really, when you were a kid? I know you didn't, and I know it didn't help you learn and mature at all. Obviously. If it did, you would not be doing this immature low effort shit to your kids. Discipline is about catching and rewarding good behavior at least as often as you punish bad behavior. Remember kind words are often more of a reward than material things. How many times have you had a kind word at the right time turn your day around?\n\nPunishment should be something that is extremely rare. If your kids are acting out, the first thing for you to do as a parent is discipline yourself. This is why good parents will tell you parenting is such hard work. You cannot expect your children to behave more mature than you do. You must set a good example which this whole situation is not.\n\nThe next step is taking the time to interact with them and teach them.\n\nIf you want to buy new cases that would be a great Christmas gift, but reset and return is a hard no. I guarantee you sooner or later your kids will figure out the new iPods are a lie. You aren't as smart as you think you are. And don't you think your kids deserve an honest parent as much as you deserve honest kids?",

You're looking for an easy way out of a tough spot but it's going to reinforce some bad ideas in your children.\n\nGifts can be revoked as a parent, temporarily or permanently, but if you take away something for bad behavior, then the only scenario in which you should give it back is for fixing that behavior. That being said, once the behavior is fixed, the reward should be returning what was taken (if you plan on returning them at all. That's entirely your discretion). What you DON'T do is bake this reward into a new Christmas gift.\n\nYour kids aren't that dull OP, they'll probably feel a lot of frustration at this without really knowing why. And it's hard to blame them. They won't be able to separate what got them their ipads back (improved behavior) from a typical christmas gift. They'll be wondering if anything they have is just open to being \"sold\", or if Christmas is just the time when you get all the stuff back that you lost privileges to. \n\nThe right move here is hard, but being a parent means setting an example. Be honest with them. Give them their ipads back (maybe with limitations this time?), but don't wait until Christmas. Reward their good behavior for what it is, not as a part of something else.\n\nThen when Christmas rolls around, buy what you can and explain to them that Christmas isn't about the price of their gift, but the actual important parts of family, gift giving and celebration. They're young, they probably won't care too much, or for too long.\n\nMy family couldn't always afford the most expensive gifts growing up, but I promise you, I would much rather look back on how my parents tried to make ends meet even when they couldn't buy us everything we wanted, rather than wondering why my Christmas gift was something my parents had taken and hidden from me.

You&#39;re looking for an easy way out of a tough spot but it&#39;s going to reinforce some bad ideas in your children.</p>\n\n<p>Gifts can be revoked as a parent, temporarily or permanently, but if you take away something for bad behavior, then the only scenario in which you should give it back is for fixing that behavior. That being said, once the behavior is fixed, the reward should be returning what was taken (if you plan on returning them at all. That&#39;s entirely your discretion). What you DON&#39;T do is bake this reward into a new Christmas gift.</p>\n\n<p>Your kids aren&#39;t that dull OP, they&#39;ll probably feel a lot of frustration at this without really knowing why. And it&#39;s hard to blame them. They won&#39;t be able to separate what got them their ipads back (improved behavior) from a typical christmas gift. They&#39;ll be wondering if anything they have is just open to being &quot;sold&quot;, or if Christmas is just the time when you get all the stuff back that you lost privileges to. </p>\n\n<p>The right move here is hard, but being a parent means setting an example. Be honest with them. Give them their ipads back (maybe with limitations this time?), but don&#39;t wait until Christmas. Reward their good behavior for what it is, not as a part of something else.</p>\n\n<p>Then when Christmas rolls around, buy what you can and explain to them that Christmas isn&#39;t about the price of their gift, but the actual important parts of family, gift giving and celebration. They&#39;re young, they probably won&#39;t care too much, or for too long.</p>\n\n<p>My family couldn&#39;t always afford the most expensive gifts growing up, but I promise you, I would much rather look back on how my parents tried to make ends meet even when they couldn&#39;t buy us everything we wanted, rather than wondering why my Christmas gift was something my parents had taken and hidden from me. Even if it comes from a place of love, the first makes me appreciate their effort so much more, while the second just leaves a bitter taste of manipulation.</p>\n</div>",

By now they often put in down after 5-10 minutes themselves and don't mind if it is taken. They absolutely watch their share of baby shark type stuff but I see educational value even in that. We sing/dance with them but it's fun for them to see how others do it and to pick out what they like. Anyway, I used to be pretty anti-tablet but am now a huge fan.",

By now they often put in down after 5-10 minutes themselves and don&#39;t mind if it is taken. They absolutely watch their share of baby shark type stuff but I see educational value even in that. We sing/dance with them but it&#39;s fun for them to see how others do it and to pick out what they like. Anyway, I used to be pretty anti-tablet but am now a huge fan.</p>\n</div>",

We homeschool and they use them for things like ABC Mouse and Hooked On Phonics. I have parental controls on them and their apple IDs are linked to mine so they can\u2019t download anything without me approving it from my phone. We limit their daily screen time and they don\u2019t even get that time until their school work and chores are done.
