He pushed me out of the way and make my eggs for me &amp; over cooked them at that. Yeah he ended up physically abusing me months later on. People with severe control issues are not safe, once they feel like they can\u2019t control you with words, it can escalate. I\u2019m not making assumptions about your ex, but I am so happy you\u2019ve found a compassionate partner. We all deserve to find kind love.</p>\n</div>",

Because of children and grandchildren, I still see him occasionally and he still tries to goad me but now it's the opposite. He tells me about a gourmet soup I used to make regularly as if I never heard of it and how he made it for the first time and how much he liked it and how he never tried it before. He used to start vicious arguments with me over this soup when we were married because he had never heard of a leek before he was married to me. So you dodged a bad situation by getting out. Kudos.",

I make my wife's tea every morning (she prefers by tea leaves so I guestimate the correct amount), sometimes a little strong or weak but she is okay with it. Life is too short to complain about the small things.  Enjoy that ground coffee and enjoy life! Thanks for the follow up too.",

        "body": "THIS.\n\nI'm a \"tea snob\" the way some people are wine snobs. I can make you tea that will boggle your mind. I'm very picky about how I do it. But to me, the number 1 rule of tea is this:\n\nIf you like what you're drinking, you're doing it right.\n\nIf you ask me why I do some of the things I do, I'll tell you. If you ask me how to make your tea taste better, I'll help you with that if I can. But there's no need for a process that some expert told you is the one true way if you can't taste the difference or like what you get without it.\n\nI do all that because I can taste the difference and because I get help with my weak digestion from certain teas properly sourced and prepared. But that's \\*me\\*. What you need might be entirely different.\n\nEdit:\n\nThere are a lot of people asking me for tea tips, but what I'd tell you depends on where you're starting from and what you want, so there's a lot of variation. I can't tell you quickly how to do what I do just like the commenter above can't distill down to a few tips her years of expertise at dialing in a new batch of coffee beans. But here are a couple:\n\n1. If you're new to some or all types of tea -- there are a lot -- samplers are your friend. r/tea is a good place to search for discussions of where to get good samplers.\n2. Actual tea leaves -- camellia sinensis -- will find ways to absorb just about anything in their environment. That can make a lot of magic, and it can cause a lot of problems.\n   1. If you store it in the kitchen or near anything with a scent or aroma, it may taint the tea. I store mine in my home office far from the kitchen,, garage, and bathrooms. Airtight, lightproof containers. The foil packaging good teas come in works.\n   2. If you wash your teaware with detergent, it will mess with the taste of your tea. I wash mine (the ordinary stuff) with half vinegar, half water, then rinse it in water. A very thorough rinse with the vinegar-and-water mix can get detergent residue off, but rinse several times. (My Serious Teaware only gets washed with hot distilled water.)\n   3. Whatever is in the water you use is going to interact with the tea leaves in a dramatic fashion. People get entire university degrees on this stuff in China. Conventional wisdom is that you should use unfiltered spring water, but how well that works is going to vary widely depending on your water source, how it was stored, and what tea leaves you're using. In a pinch distilled water + 3-5 grains of salt per quart of water is going to be better than most of the water in the USA for tea purposes. If you have a favorite tea, experiment with different waters and see what they do that you like and don't like. There is a LOT written online about water sources, filtering, etc.",

But here are a couple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you&#39;re new to some or all types of tea -- there are a lot -- samplers are your friend. <a href=\"/r/tea\">r/tea</a> is a good place to search for discussions of where to get good samplers.</li>\n<li>Actual tea leaves -- camellia sinensis -- will find ways to absorb just about anything in their environment. That can make a lot of magic, and it can cause a lot of problems.\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you store it in the kitchen or near anything with a scent or aroma, it may taint the tea. I store mine in my home office far from the kitchen,, garage, and bathrooms. Airtight, lightproof containers. The foil packaging good teas come in works.</li>\n<li>If you wash your teaware with detergent, it will mess with the taste of your tea. I wash mine (the ordinary stuff) with half vinegar, half water, then rinse it in water. A very thorough rinse with the vinegar-and-water mix can get detergent residue off, but rinse several times. (My Serious Teaware only gets washed with hot distilled water.)</li>\n<li>Whatever is in the water you use is going to interact with the tea leaves in a dramatic fashion. People get entire university degrees on this stuff in China. Conventional wisdom is that you should use unfiltered spring water, but how well that works is going to vary widely depending on your water source, how it was stored, and what tea leaves you&#39;re using. In a pinch distilled water + 3-5 grains of salt per quart of water is going to be better than most of the water in the USA for tea purposes. If you have a favorite tea, experiment with different waters and see what they do that you like and don&#39;t like. There is a LOT written online about water sources, filtering, etc.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Sometimes she drinks the stuff I make, sometimes it's just Starbucks or a Keurig, and frankly I don't mind at all. It's her choice to drink what she wants without judgment.",

I usually worked morning shifts, so I became QUITE well acquainted with my role there over the three years I worked there. \n\nIt also bears mentioning that I was raised by a narcissist (and I do mean a *true* narcissist, not just someone who thinks highly of themself), and my best was never ever ever good enough for her; at work, for the first time ever, my best could be good enough, and my hard work was noticed and praised. \n\nSo fast-forward a few years\u2014I had to drop out of college due to illness, and long story short, I ended up homeless at age 21. So this one day I\u2019m walking to the gas station for cigs (I am three years off tobacco!) and this gal a few years older than me (maybe 26-ish at the time) stops me and is like \u201care you homeless?\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cnooooooo \ud83d\udc40\u201d and she\u2019s like \u201c\ud83e\udd28 I was homeless for four years\u201d and I\u2019m like *fuck, she can tell for sure*. \n\nSo that girl (shoutout to Emmy!) tells me that she got out of homelessness by becoming a barista. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those jobs where the more experience you have, the better job you get, the more you make.\u201d \n\nSo later that year I got my first *real* barista job, using my experience in high school as my one and only relevant work experience, and Emmy was pretty much totally correct. I started at a gelato place that also served espresso, moved up to a corporate franchise on a college campus where I wasn\u2019t allowed to take tips, switched to a local shop on a rough side of town, and then I moved away and traveled for a couple of years. So I came back and got a job at a REALLY upscale cafe where I made HELLA tips, where I stayed for over a year\u2014sadly, it was an UNBEARABLY toxic work environment and it\u2019s actually the one and only time I have lost my temper enough to quit. No notice, no discussion, I don\u2019t even think I clocked out\u2014I just grabbed my purse and dipped after finally telling my boss off after 13 months of disrespect. \n\nSo I left coffee and worked retail for about six months before having to leave work while recovering from surgery. After recovering I went back to the coffee shop in the rough part of town for a while, but ended up leaving because the job wasn\u2019t very disability-friendly (I have ptsd and instead of believing and respecting my triggers he would go \u201cwell why is *that* triggering?\u201d Then get all pissy when I told him something horrible; like what did you think I was gonna say, man?). \n\nSo while I was at the upscale place, people kept telling me they wished I had met \u201cAlex\u201d (fake name). \u201cAlex\u201d had worked there a year before I did (there was a different manager and a better work environment back then), and everyone kept saying we would get along because, and I quote, \u201che has tattoos too!\u201d Lol. \nSo while I was at the shop on the rough side of town, I stopped at a new coffee kiosk in a little mall in my neighborhood (that mall was HOPPIN in the 90s but is pretty dead now; the only reason I go is because it\u2019s right by my house and makes a good shortcut to Target, but there are almost no shops there except an H&M and a few overpriced boutiques). I stop and say hi and tell the dude working there that I\u2019m a barista too and we proceed to chat about coffee and espresso machines and steaming techniques and shit for like twenty minutes, when I mention \u201cI used to work at PretentiousCafe\u201d and he\u2019s like \u201coh I worked at PretentiousCafe in 2018\u201d and I was like \u201cHOLD UP, are you \u2018Alex\u2019?\u201d\n\nHe was, in fact, Alex, and I gave him my contact info. \n\nSo I left my not-PTSD-friendly job and went full-time reading tarot, including a few shifts per week in a psychic shop in my area where I\u2019ve been shopping for years. This was super fucking exciting for me, as I\u2019d wanted to work there for like five years\u2014so I was HEARTBROKEN when in February we had to make staffing cutbacks and I was let go \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI left on great terms (my boss baked **two** cheesecakes for my last day) and am on the list of people to re-hire when business picks up, but I was s h a t t e r e d. \n\nAnd it just so happens that on the same day I was informed that that would be my last month there, \u2018Alex\u2019 texted me about working at his shop. \n\nSo now I work here, mostly when we vend at events, which I love\u2014I get to be outside and the tips are deeeeecent\u2014and he\u2019s teaching me how to roast. \n\nThere were a few other weird jobs I had in between coffee shops, but those are all other stories and none of them lasted nearly as long as any of my barista jobs.",
