That kids do that because parents like your wife pat them on the back about it!  </p>\n\n<p>I bet that if your wife would have been the one cat called on she would have demanded you do something about it!!!  </p>\n\n<p>I &quot;cannot&quot; believe her. This is either sexism and bad parenting if she truly believes what he did was ok, or powerplay because he is her biological child and you&#39;re his step parent, which if true, is manipulative. Parenting cannot be judged upon whether there is biology or not involved. What you did was either right or wrong. Can&#39;t let &quot;HER&quot; son walk?! Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I guess when things are good he&#39;s &quot;our&quot; problem but when I scold him his &quot;your&quot; son?  ok then.   </p>\n\n<p>If she would have been a good parent (talking this specific instant) She would have chewed the meat off of his bones about what he did to that poor woman, and THEN she might as well argued that you couldn&#39;t leave them to walk home. That would be acceptable. Passing off sexual harassment as normal because she didn&#39;t want her boy walking home is ridiculous!  </p>\n\n<p>GOOD FOR YOU, for standing up for that poor woman!</p>\n</div>",

It is not okay. It is not harmless.\n\nIt should always be called out. Always. \n\nIt is not acceptable for rowan and jack to act this way. it is not acceptable for your wife to enable it. It is not acceptable that you are being guilt tripped for calling this out.\n\nNta \n\nThis behaviour is repulsive and Rowan, jack and wife are definitely AHs. If my son behaved this way, walking home would be the least of his problems, and if he had a temper tantrum and refused to talk to me for calling him out for being an entitled, misogynistic creep\u2026 no way in hell would I be the one worrying if I should apologise. \n\nThe fact he just got engaged is completely irrelevant - unless to highlight that he is not husband material.

Your wife has already told you that she thinks her son is entitled to engage in abusive behaviour against women because he is male. If future dil needs help, she won\u2019t have an ally in her mil. You need to be ready to step up. \n\nProbably worth checking in with your 16-yo, too. Your wife and step son are clearly toxic role models on this subject.
