I know you are upset, but consider whether you want your idiot niece to have a felony record over this stupidity. Or find herself on probation for years as she pays back the value of the coat. Your sister would likely pay a couple of grand for an attorney, at least, to try to avoid the criminal penalties the girl actually deserves.  \n\nYou might want to check the law where you live to see how badly this could go for your niece and you might do what she did not do: seriously consider the consequences if you decide to take the matter to the police.  If I were in this situation, I would sit in the same room with your sister and niece and go through the laws AND your feelings about what she did. Calmly explain your possible choices, and that something serious has to happen here. \n\nIf you choose to go the police and court route, that is your choice and they will consider you the AH from then on.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. But look. In my state, damage to property over $250 is a felony. A 16 year old may get treated as a youth but could still face prison.  I know you are upset, but consider whether you want your idiot niece to have a felony record over this stupidity. Or find herself on probation for years as she pays back the value of the coat. Your sister would likely pay a couple of grand for an attorney, at least, to try to avoid the criminal penalties the girl actually deserves.  </p>\n\n<p>You might want to check the law where you live to see how badly this could go for your niece and you might do what she did not do: seriously consider the consequences if you decide to take the matter to the police.  If I were in this situation, I would sit in the same room with your sister and niece and go through the laws AND your feelings about what she did. Calmly explain your possible choices, and that something serious has to happen here. </p>\n\n<p>If you choose to go the police and court route, that is your choice and they will consider you the AH from then on.

You even felt bad about wearing it at all anywhere due to potentially ruining it, and this definetly was not what you were thinking could happen.</p>\n</div>",

Given the video evidence, and with a criminal conviction, you are guaranteed a win.  Any decent lawyer would advise your sister and niece that it is an unwinnable case and their best hope would be to settle with you.

It's not about them wanting to flaunt their wealth 24/7 or because they are out of touch with reality, it's simply because it *is* their reality.\n\nI once asked my husband for a \"simple necklace\" I could use every day in stead of my wedding band(I'm a nurse so no rings allowed). \n\nIn my mind a \"simple necklace\" is something silver or maybe if it gets wild, it could have been white gold like our wedding band.\n\nIn his mind \"simple\" was apparently a necklace from Cartier, and everything was like that. \n\nThey do stuff that is completely normal to them, but to most of us is something we just wouldn't think of. \n\nI had so many \"what the f...?\"-monents in the 8 years we were together, and when I tell people about some of them they think I'm making them up, because so many of them sound completely insane. \n\nAs an example my then SIL had a absolutely magnificent hysterical tantrum of epic proportions, when the architect on her new house told her, that if she wanted to be able to open up the skylight in the living room, there was no way around also having to install some mechanical device, that could perform this specific action.

If they/she can't afford it, I'd say charge the new one and she needs to get a job and make payments with a contract in writing of how much she gives you every pay period.

They can only be sheared every couple of years (4-5 times for the entire lifespan of the animal), and they\u2019re located at a relatively high altitude and free roaming, so rounding them up and shearing them can be time consuming.  Plus LP uses vicu\u00f1a fleece from Argentinian vicunas, which aren\u2019t as numerous as the ones from Peru. \n\nVicu\u00f1as in general were actually endangered for a while due to poaching and still are protected under some conservation programs.  I think it was illegal to trade vicu\u00f1a wool for a while, until their numbers went back up.  LP actually has done a lot to help protect vicu\u00f1as too (setting up reserves, etc) and that is also reflected in the cost. \n\nAll that said, it still doesn\u2019t mean the price is worth it to most people.

They can only be sheared every couple of years (4-5 times for the entire lifespan of the animal), and they\u2019re located at a relatively high altitude and free roaming, so rounding them up and shearing them can be time consuming.  Plus LP uses vicu\u00f1a fleece from Argentinian vicunas, which aren\u2019t as numerous as the ones from Peru. </p>\n\n<p>Vicu\u00f1as in general were actually endangered for a while due to poaching and still are protected under some conservation programs.  I think it was illegal to trade vicu\u00f1a wool for a while, until their numbers went back up.  LP actually has done a lot to help protect vicu\u00f1as too (setting up reserves, etc) and that is also reflected in the cost. </p>\n\n<p>All that said, it still doesn\u2019t mean the price is worth it to most people.

Not to mention that now some teenagers worry about creating enough content to maintain followers, or about going viral. \n\nBut even with that, I still don't think that alone makes kids worse or more reckless than they always were. I think kids just tend to misbehave in different ways now than they did in the past, and for different social rewards. It has always been cool among certain teenage social groups to be a destructive asshole, and there have always been teens who thought that was stupid. Now kids may not be pulling pranks to impress a few people at their school, but instead to impress people on TikTok. There isn't really a difference there morally, but the internet is forever.\n\nWhen my mom was a kid, the things her peers did were *way* more dangerous and harmful than what my peers did when I was a kid, because they were less monitored, and kids these days are even more monitored than I was, because they know anyone could record them at any time and post their lowest moment online for millions to see. Not to mention parents even having GPS tracking of their kids as a social norm in many places. \n\nA lot of pranks in the past also used to be based on bigotry, where the person being pranked was a minority of some kind. A lot of punching down. Kids are just as irresponsible and bad at thinking through consequences as ever, but boy are the older generations lucky that the stuff they said and did as a teenager isn't publicly documented, or how else would they get away with hypocritically claiming that teenagers are worse now?\n\nBtw this is not me arguing with you.

And Shoes....I would find a shoemaker and get bespoke.</p>\n\n<p>(My middle class versions, besides my polo duffle, are:\n1 Made Well leather tote/carry all bags (200ish, 5+ years later w much use still nice).\n2 good dept store (Saks, Bloomies etc) cashmere or wool overcoats - bonus if bought at end of season/on promotion (these tend to last 3-5 years, cashmere you need to be more careful with).\n3 Doc Martens (100-300 and basically indestructible)</p>\n</div>",
