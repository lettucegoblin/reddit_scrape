No concern for the cat, no concern for her boyfriend's feelings. I don't understand how you hurt people and animals this way!\n\nI had a friend once who found his front gate open and his dog missing. He walked the neighborhood for 3 hours looking for his dog. I decided to check the websites of some shelters in his area and found a picture of a dog that resembled his. I called and through a few quick questions and additional photos, we knew it was him. The person at the shelter told me someone had just pulled up a van and just dropped the dog in the front yard of the shelter. She provided me with a description of the van. I gave my friend the details and he was extremely quiet on the phone for a minute. Then just said, \"That's my mother's van.\" He was devastated and cried for about 45 minutes because he decided it would be best to leave the dog there and have him adopted to a loving family rather than risk getting him back and having his mother do something potentially worse to his dog. He had him for a few years but his mother got tired of having a dog in the house and just dumped him at a shelter while my friend was in work. When he confronted his mother about it, she just shrugged. To this day, I still feel so much hurt and anger for my friend.  \n\n\nEdited: grammar",
