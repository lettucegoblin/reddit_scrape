This read to me that he was trying to isolate her from friends and family to better control her. \n\nI feel like I have ESP after reading this update. He made it out to be like his family and friends were all that mattered because that will be her new family (and probably only family from his perspective) Then, THEN, he put his last name on the ring despite the fact that she was very vocal she was keeping hers!? Ah, chef\u2019s kiss. That was a power play. He probably figured if he forced it on her, she would just cave. He didn\u2019t want to marry her, he wanted to absorb her, and make her an extension of himself and his family. Also, he\u2019s not taking one crumb of responsibility. Classic. \n\nGood on you for letting it all play out. Good on her for walking away. The red flags here were so big, they might as well have been a blanket.",
