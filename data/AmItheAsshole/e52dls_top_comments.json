I come home for summer break and they converted my bedroom into a gym, tossed my bed, dressers, etc. and gave away EVERYTHING! left in my room to charity - supposedly they \"lost\" the deer-bone hunting knife my dad gave me along with a bunch of other collectibles and oddities I collected over time. For 3 months, I was expected to sleep on the living room couch, which wasn't even a pull-out. I had no dresser, closet space, or anywhere to put what little I owned.\n\nThey even forced me to sell my car to my brother because he needed one and I didn't because I lived in Boston. Admittedly, I parked the car and was planning on selling, but didn't want to sell to my brother because I knew he'd break it. Big shock, 2 months after I sold the car to him, my brother snapped the driveshaft doing a roll-back burnout.\n\nFrom that point forward, I have never stayed with them for more than a weekend. Also - another shocker - I'm still on crappy terms with them after 15 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: and to be clear, when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING! They gave away my clothes, shoes, CDs, and whatever other possessions I owned that were in my bedroom. They didn't bother to consult, ask, tell, or otherwise warn me because I would have taken a bus to pick up my stuff. They didn't even pack a small box with my clothes. They gave away over half of my entire wardrobe and I had about 10 shirts total. \n\nAs far as my car, prior to being forced to sell the car to my brother he had crashed his first car and blew the engine on his second when he decided to fuck around with the timing gears while doing some minor work he didn't even remotely know how to do. At 17 he was already on his third car. After he snapped the drive shaft - specifically the rear input shaft - he got it repaired, attempted to sell the car, didn't latch the hood fully, smashed the windshield and sold the car for 500.00 to my dad. My dad spent about 500.00 getting it all sorted and then turned around and immediately sold the car for 3000.00. So in the course of 2 weeks, I sold my car for 1000.00 (1000.00 less than I bought it for) to my brother after my parents threatening to forge my signature on a bill of sale, he did a ton of damage which cost him another 500.00 to fix, and then my dad profited off the sale of the car.",

My daughter told me over Thanksgiving that her partner slept on a couch growing up when his dad married a woman with 2 kids, moved into her house.

Who would do that to a child?  HER kids had rooms.  Couldn't the girls share a room? I was furious, because my daughter's boyfriend is an awesome young man.\n\nAnyway, at your age, if he wants you there, he shouldn't relegate you to a sofa bed.  That is very minimizing.

When I started reading this I thought you were a college kid or something, which I was sorta leaning towards NAH since a lot of parents seem to do that, but after reading that you\u2019re still 15, its definitely not you in the wrong. If your dad wants you to feel welcomed, he shouldn\u2019t have let your stepmom alienate you by turning your bedroom into her work space. \n\nI really sympathize with you on a deep level, my dude. When I move in with my dad at age 12, he was in the process of building a house that was supposed to originally have 3 bedrooms. It took til my senior year in high school, and by that time he had changed his plans to a one-bedroom house with an adjacent guest cabin that I slept in, but had to give it up any time there was company or one of my older step-siblings (who I loathe) were in town. It really messed me up as a teen, and I still have problems because of it to this day. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel welcome there because they took away your private space, don\u2019t let either of them guilt you into staying there and pretending it doesn\u2019t hurt your feelings. Eventually it will wear on you and probably cause other problems. \n\nYour dad sucks for doing this in the first place, but he extra sucks for not talking to you about it or at the very least informing you beforehand. And your stepmom sucks for even bringing up the idea in the first place. If she wanted an \u201coffice\u201d area that bad, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of other spaces in the house that could have been made to work without taking away your room.",

When I started reading this I thought you were a college kid or something, which I was sorta leaning towards NAH since a lot of parents seem to do that, but after reading that you\u2019re still 15, its definitely not you in the wrong. If your dad wants you to feel welcomed, he shouldn\u2019t have let your stepmom alienate you by turning your bedroom into her work space. </p>\n\n<p>I really sympathize with you on a deep level, my dude.

Of course you\u2019re hurt and angry - and Reddit *loves* calling out shitty family members, so you\u2019re getting a lot of support for your decision to just be done. And if you truly want to do that, that\u2019s totally okay. \n\nThat said ... your dad cried and immediately offered to change it back? Sure, you can read ulterior motives into that (and maybe you are right) - but to an outside observer, that really sounds like a sincere response. Most people can\u2019t just cry on command for an impromptu theatrical performance, you know? \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the babysitting. You\u2019re absolutely right that you should not be forced into the role of babysitter for your stepsiblings, and that should stop. But it\u2019s entirely plausible that one of your dad\u2019s motivations for doing that is to get you to spend time with them so that you grow to see them as *your family* as well. Good motivations don\u2019t excuse bad actions, but they may make them forgivable - more importantly, they should make those bad actions fairly easy to correct. \n\nIf you want to be done with your dad, whether totally or partially, whether just for a little while or forever, that\u2019s okay - you get to decide with whom you have relationships and the nature of those relationships. And you certainly don\u2019t have to be happy about the fact that your dad has remarried and has stepchildren. \n\nBut, depending on the rest of your relationship with him, you may want to consider having a serious, frank discussion with your dad about these things. It\u2019s possible that he is trying to handle this situation well and just doing a terrible job of it. To be fair, remarrying a partner with children isn\u2019t exactly the easiest situation to navigate and it doesn\u2019t sound as if he has done this before. \n\nIf that is the case, you may want to give him a chance to be better by *clearly* telling specific things that you want and *don\u2019t* want from him. If he sincerely wants you in his home and family, he will put in *visible* effort to correct the things you have problems with. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re not the asshole no matter what you choose and it isn\u2019t your responsibility to parent yourself. But if your dad is sincerely trying and just doing a shitty job, you\u2019re old enough to help build the relationship you want with him - a bit of guidance and communication from you may work wonders towards fixing this situation. \n\nPeople - including parents, especially in complicated situations like this - aren\u2019t always good at showing others that they love and value them. In fact, they\u2019re often bad at it. But if they genuinely value the relationship, they\u2019ll *actively* work on it if you give them a push in the right direction. Consider giving that opportunity to your dad by telling him clearly what you want from him. If it works, then that\u2019s fantastic; if it doesn\u2019t, you can distance yourself knowing that you\u2019ve truly made the right decision for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit**: I say this as someone whose dad literally never even tried - when he divorced my mom, he was done with me. I don\u2019t excuse genuinely bad parents and if he is one, you\u2019re better off without him. But if he is a dad who actually loves you and wants you in his home, that\u2019s worth working on.",

It is not right that your stepbrothers feel supported and loved while you do not.\n\nDivorce is already hard on everyone involved - parents, kids, in-laws, etc. When parents with children divorce and remarry, particularly if everyone involved has bio kids, it's super important to be considerate of all involved. I don't have kids myself, may not have any ever, but it's basic knowledge that how a child is treated as a youth can impact who they are as adults. Feeling like a burden, a guest, a nothing, a servant...really can ruin relationships and self-esteem. The bedroom incident is just the straw that broke the camel's back.

After the first time where our brother got the room while sister and I took over the living room, her on a couch me on a cot with sleeping bag, we refused to sleep over again until we had beds. (Second time was only because of a major fight with mom and grandma gave us her bed that time) Spoiler alert: Dad never moved, we never had our own beds or rooms where he lived, and the day visits with him and the grandparents grew a relationship that is much more akin to having an extra grandpa than a dad.\n\nThrough all that the custody agreement never changed.  I suppose if he'd wanted to try to force overnights our mom could have used the lack of beds against him. But it was always supposed to be temporary for him to live with his parents. I remember countless conversations in the early years. What if he got a 2 bedroom and gave us girls bunk beds in the living room with private room for older brother? No, that won't fly dad. What about girls get the room and older brother sleeps in the living room? A 15 year old boy living on a couch is a no go too. He seemed to think a 3 bedroom idea where nobody had to sleep in the living room wasn't possible and eventually gave up.",

And being *made* to watch your siblings (or step/half/whatever-siblings) is still parentification. It doesn't become non-abusive just because they only *occasionally* saddle their child with a burden that should fall to a parent or paid adult against their will. It's not an appropriate burden to force upon a kid *ever*. The only reason I was uncertain about degree in the above comment is that sometimes otherwise good, non-abusive people just don't realize that this is wrong.",

I saw what happened to my cousin after she spent more than a year off school to work on the farm and be the primary caregiver for their Mum, who had Huntington's Disease and was suffering from the associated dementia. My cousin was 15 when she decided to take leave from school - and the Education Department allowed it, and so did all her older siblings and their Dad.  After 12 months or so, my cousin reached overload point and spent some time in hospital, not knowing quite who she or anyone else was, and not recognising anyone she knew.  She's since recovered from that, and has her own family and stuff, but at the time, all the adults started panicking because they thought the disease had suddenly manifested (hereditary, more at risk if female).  I was horrified by all this, and couldn't understand why my parents wouldn't at least drive me to their place on weekends so i could help out. \"Family help family\" and \"it's their business\" are two notions that i still despise.  The family had some help, but in their and my family's church, the phrase \"we don't want to get outsiders involved\" was gospel. Those words still raise my pulse rate slightly, and i haven't set foot in one of their meetings for over 22 years.\n\nETA my cousin couldn't say no to being the caregiver, not with the way that church insisted that girls be raised, not with the expectations all around her from her family, and definitely not when she heard all the excuses from everybody else and realised that she was the only one to look after their Mum. Once she offered, instead of talking her out of it, they all jumped on board straightaway, and suddenly she was in a position where instead of having an option to say \"ummm maybe I shouldn't do this alone\", she would have had to stop caring for her mother. By the time she became the carer, she was already doing most of the work, and that's why she decided to ask for time off school.",

Those words still raise my pulse rate slightly, and i haven&#39;t set foot in one of their meetings for over 22 years.</p>\n\n<p>ETA my cousin couldn&#39;t say no to being the caregiver, not with the way that church insisted that girls be raised, not with the expectations all around her from her family, and definitely not when she heard all the excuses from everybody else and realised that she was the only one to look after their Mum. Once she offered, instead of talking her out of it, they all jumped on board straightaway, and suddenly she was in a position where instead of having an option to say &quot;ummm maybe I shouldn&#39;t do this alone&quot;, she would have had to stop caring for her mother. By the time she became the carer, she was already doing most of the work, and that&#39;s why she decided to ask for time off school.</p>\n</div>",
