Often, developpers are software engineers&#39; &quot;subordinate&quot; sortof. I am not saying that one is superior to the other though.\nAnd if you only look skill-wise or experience-wise, OP did at least 5 years of engineering school, plus her 4 years of experience, when he did a quick coding bootcamp (3 months usually where I am) and he just landed his job. Even he realized that he was no match for OP, that OP knew it from the start, and he properly ridiculed himself for the whole evening.</p>\n</div>",
