The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes. \n\nThe complete opposite can also be true: people who value individualism and don't put stock in collectivism may consider the collectivists to be assholes.\n\nOr in the case of your examples: there are circumstances in those scenarios where people would not be an asshole for doing what you describe as asshole behaviour - circumstances, and nuance, matter.\n\nHowever, you do raise a point with respect to the hive mind trends we can see in posts and responses, and I've seen it go both ways (some threads there is say a collectivist response that is highly voted and the opposing individualistic take is downvoted, or vice versa).\n\nI think that is more concerning than the fact that there are such diverse perspectives on what is or isn't asshole behaviour - as when the hive mind occurs it can stifle people from commenting and adding to a diverse discussion. Perhaps the period in which comments are randomized is not long enough? \n\nOr perhaps, on accepting judgment, we realize that while we can accept them all, not all judgments ought to be weighted the same: if someone gives a judgment but offers zero reasoning or is unwilling to back it up, well, I wouldn't put much weight on their judgement. \n\nBut how we weight judgments and the ones we choose to give power to are individual choices that the poster will make. This kind of bucks the \"X judgment is popular therefore X judgment is correct\" - as if the popularity of a judgment makes it more correct than others (that's fallacious and illogical, but since it is often assumed it creates the kind of hive mind trend we see and bitch about).",

        "body": "I've been lurking on this sub for a month and this is what I've observed.\n\nYou generally get two types of popular posts here: validation posts where the OP is clearly NTA by any measure of common decency and seek to just be confirmed by the crowd, or morally obtuse OPs who are clearly TA, but want to argue that they are right. Rare is it that someone is humble enough to be genuinely open to the crowd's judgment. Honestly, this should be expected given the nature of the sub. It's human nature to be defensive rather than humble, and since all we have usually is the word of the OP, we can expect the narratives to be tilted in OP's favor.\n\nI think the reason why judgments are often not perhaps in line with how the rest of society might decide is due to two reasons. One is that most of the clear-cut cases involve abuse, manipulation, or gross inconsideration of either the OP (or, in the case where OP is TA, the victim)'s rights. The sub appears to be weighted toward a thorough, even extreme, individualism in which individual rights and choices are nearly absolute so long as it follows the law.\\* This individualism is a good model to apply when obvious rights are being violated, and the kind of people who are genuinely hurt and wondering if they're TA are the type who have trouble asserting themselves appropriately. They need more individualism and boundary-setting.\n\nLife, however, is often more complicated than those cases. There are many instances in a failing marriage, for instance, where both sides can take some blame. I've seen this happen in real life more than once, where one can make equally plausible cases for either partner being more of a jerk than the other. It's actually relatively rare for the \"right\" side to be perfectly obvious. But those posts usually don't get tons of upvotes, even though we have a label for it (ESH).\n\nThe second is related to Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory (which [the Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kxkd3/am-i-the-asshole-reddit) that examined the survey of the sub touched on). The majority of the sub is liberal in political and social orientation. According to Haidt, those with liberal views tend to emphasize \"fairness/reciprocity\" and \"harm/care\" as the two central poles of morality. This is very compatible with a focus on individual rights, and the most popular posts tend to center around clear violations of fairness and/or obvious harm. However, conservatives tend to not only take fairness and harm into account but also \"purity,\" \"ingroup-loyalty,\" and \"authority.\" This sub frequently sides against views that privilege these three factors, particularly ingroup-loyalty, based on how swift people are to advise cutting the offenders off completely, even if they are family, spouse, or longtime friends. \"Purity\" is criticized as being oppressive, and \"authority\" is usually suspect unless it agrees with the posters' views.\n\n(A really good example is the recent locked post by the absentee biological father who insisted on being the only one to walk his daughter down the aisle. His appeal was almost exclusively centered around purity and in-group loyalty, which the vast majority of posters\u2014myself included\u2014found deeply repulsive. However, in many conservative cultures, his argument makes perfect sense, and is in fact related to the foundation of their traditional sexual morality. His view was blatantly patriarchal in a way that's scandalous to most modern people, but there are many places in the world where that view is not only mainstream, but strictly enforced by society and religion. That certainly doesn't make it right, but it does explain why such views even exist and when encountered seem so foreign and offensive.)\n\nIn the outside world, where there is still a mix of liberals and conservatives (one often dominating regions over the other), you're going to have more people who take the other 3 moral foundations into account. Haidt believes that this is a large part of the polarization of the country, because the two orientations are often incompatible with one another. When moral consensus begins to fade, you will inevitably get conflict. Here, though, there's actually a pretty thorough moral consensus, centered around individual rights and freedoms. Hence the seeming uniformity of the sub.\n\nOne last comment. I grew up in a conservative church where it was constantly bemoaned that society had fallen to \"moral relativism\" when the Bible said that morality was absolute. I never thought that was an adequate explanation for life's complexities. Now, however, it seems that black and white morality is back in fashion. Judgments here and elsewhere are often unnuanced, absolute, and sweeping. Perhaps we need a little more \"relativism\" to balance the scales again.\n\n^(\\*Major exception: adultery, where there is an absolute and unequivocal condemnation in nearly all circumstances and little to no sympathy for the participants. It seems nearly no punishment short of death is unapproved for cheating here. This is a big change from my youth, when many people wanted to give Bill Clinton a pass for his adultery and subsequent attempts to cover it up. He would not get away with it now.)",

OP even admitted they made good money and that by the end of the year WORST case scenario wouldn't even be $12 donated. Vast majority \"NTA - that's YOUR money!

The guy was on a last minute flight, was pretty tall and they had no more seats available in a roomier area. He was stuck behind someone who reclined their seat all of the way and was hitting his knees. He asked her politely if she could sit up, she said no and because he still wasn't comfortable he got the flight attendant involved. Most of the comments were that he was the asshole because if he wanted to be more comfortable he should have booked a better seat. \n\nMy opinion was that he wasn't the asshole. A lot of commentors were saying it's the airlines who design these planes to be uncomfortable so they could pack as many people in it as possible. While that's true, the lady still could have been considerate to those behind her. \n\n2. Three people were traveling together and two of them (male) had an empty seat between them and the third (the OP) was behind them. A fourth person sees that she's stuck between two males and asks if they can sit together while she sits on the aisle because of her religion. They say no, and the person sitting in the back butts in and acts like a total knob and basically is super rude to this fourth person and demands that the two people not move. The fourth traveler then asks if the third can switch seats since they admittedly all know eachother. Third traveler also refuses and continues to berate the fourth.  Most or all of the comments said OP was not the asshole and if the fourth person wanted to not sit between two males she should have booked her seat accordingly. \n\nAgain maybe I'm wrong, but it wouldn't have hurt one of the two guys to just switch over. I've noticed a trend were two people traveling will sit with a space between them so they could have more room. I feel like that's a bit of a scam and anyone who does this is basically screwing a stranger over and forcing someone to sit between two people who are going to talk over them. It's an uncomfortable situation for sure. \n\nJust because you may be technically right doesn't mean it isn't wrong. Why can't people just be nice??",

So many people were calling the kid \"a symbol of betrayal\" that must make the ex physically ill whenever he sees him. Like, no, he's a *child* and while th ex didn't need to care for him monetarily it is beyond cruel to suddenly withhold affection from a child.
