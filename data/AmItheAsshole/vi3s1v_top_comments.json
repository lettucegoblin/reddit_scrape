As soon as he moved in with me and a 1 year lease to our apartment was signed\u2026essentially \u201clocking\u201d me into the relationship, he pulled a complete 180 and his behavior changed. \n\nI had a beloved dog at the time. She was very well behaved/obedient trained, housebroken, and honestly a little on the lazy side (she was 6 yo at the time, so she was out of her puppy stage). He first set ground rules. \n\n1) no getting up on MY couch that I bought, which was the #1 place for snuggles\n\n2) no sleeping in the bed\u2026that I once again bought, but I let this slide because I understand some people just don\u2019t like to sleep with animals\n\n3) anytime she would follow me around the house, which she did often because well\u2026she\u2019s a dog and wants to follow her \u201cmaster\u201d he would yell at her to go in her kennel because it just annoyed him. \n\nMy dog was timid around him. And it seemed no matter how much I tried to put my foot down he would fight 10xs harder. \n\nOne day while I was at work he opened the door and left it open \u201cto enjoy the breeze on a nice day\u201d knowing my dog was inside. He had the time to safely put his cat in a closed room before doing this, but left my dog out. She ran out of the house and I came home to a missing dog. After searching for hours I returned home to find my dog waiting on the front porch. \n\nA few months later she had mysteriously got hurt, had broken ribs, a punctured lung, and her spleen was bleeding. His story is that she got out again and was hit by a car. The vet, however, said that it could have happened but usually injuries sustained are much worse and I was lucky they weren\u2019t as severe as the usual hit and run. I think he kicked her. \n\nAfter she returned from the few days she was at the vet I was told she may have diarrhea and vomiting and to keep an eye out for it. I went to work and came home to find my dog in her kennel outside, without water ( this was in the middle of the southern summer), covered in her own crap and panting uncontrollably. I had to then rush her back to the vet which resulted in more $$$ due to another expensive stay. \n\nI could not afford to break this lease, and he was bleeding me dry with the vet bills. I ended up rehoming my dog and I was stuck in the worlds worst roommate situation. \n\nThen guess what. The abuse turned on me! And we weren\u2019t even freaking dating!! It started verbal then hit physical. My mom drove the 9hrs down south to pick me up and take me back home. \n\nIn this specific situation you\u2019re NTA for defending your daughter and protecting your beloved cat. But hear my warning. This is a sign of abuse. Anyone who can treat an animal this way can and will treat a person just as bad. He\u2019s already showing abusive, controlling, and manipulative behavior. For you and your daughters safety you need to end this relationship. Like, yesterday. And if you choose to look past his behavior I would consider you the AH for continuing to subject your daughter to abuse. I didn\u2019t have a child to worry about, and if I did I would have tried harder to leave my ex sooner than I had. It\u2019s not a healthy environment for a child to be in. (I do now have a child, and as a parent it\u2019s your responsibility to put your child\u2019s needs/wants/feelings before your own)\n\nAnd screw him for trying to intimidate/control your daughter by secluding her from her beloved pet. Not only that but he endangered the cat by letting it out. I bet he will seclude you from friends and family too (that\u2019s another thing my ex did after I got rid of my dog)",

In fact you did not report him to the police for animal cruelty for his stunt. </p>\n\n<p>You have seen this man for what he is, would you trust him with your daughter&#39;s life?  He&#39;ll see her as the one that got you mad at him. I assure you he will get worse and start making other demands.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This man is scary and not a person I would trust with my pet, child &amp; shown how dangerous he can be.  Maybe his family is against him if he has acted like this before. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>BTW, You are now to blame for telling the truth and protecting your daughter.  He accepted no responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>He is cruel &amp; heartless</p>\n</div>",

I don&#39;t know what my older brother is like, because he lives out of country now, and rarely came by even before, but to my understanding, he was a LOT like this AH.  He disliked animals (mainly because he couldn&#39;t control them), though he apparently changed a bit because he did get a cat my other brother said he adored.  He was literally kicked out of one of my other brother&#39;s house (I have 4 brothers) because of how he treated my brother&#39;s cat. I couldn&#39;t do anything, but he also made it so my cat didn&#39;t like travelling because I was getting ready to go on vacation so had my cat in a cage ready to go and he approached the front causing the cat to freak out (he wasn&#39;t fond of men).</p>\n\n<p>So, I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if my brother&#39;s fiance had done this, and I definitely would have sided with OP.  Most of my family would as well.</p>\n</div>",

To my mind, the goal of going no contact is not to hurt the other person or try to force them to change, but to protect yourself from someone who repeatedly refuses to respect you or your boundaries when you are in contact with them. If they eventually sincerely grow and change, perhaps you would consider getting back in contact (perhaps not) but the goal is not to force change in the other person, just to remove yourself from the harmful circumstances. The goal of the silent treatment is to upset and punish the other person for a perceived slight and force them to apologize and change their behavior to what you want.
