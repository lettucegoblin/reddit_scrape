I\u2019ve been able to adjust my eating habits, see what works well with my body and doesn\u2019t, what makes me feel good and what doesn\u2019t. You learn to adapt. It sounds like she needs to learn about her body and make some adjustments.</p>\n</div>",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like \"I prefer pink over blue\" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm \"emotionally stronger\" than her. \n\nMy parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. \n\nI was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. \n\nMy sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has \"Euthyrox\" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. \n\nShe's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.\n\nI'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. \n\nMy parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic \"I should apologise since I'm more mature\". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. \n\nI ask them \"so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?\" \n\nNow they're mad at me too.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she&#39;s sensitive and I&#39;m &quot;emotionally stronger&quot; than her. </p>\n\n<p>My parents never controlled my sister&#39;s diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. </p>\n\n<p>I was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn&#39;t think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she&#39;d be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto&#39;s Thyroiditis while my sister didn&#39;t, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto&#39;s, and have been on medication ever since. </p>\n\n<p>My sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what&#39;s happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won&#39;t take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that&#39;s why she was overweight. The box has &quot;Euthyrox&quot; written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. </p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn&#39;t want anyone to mean to her because she&#39;s fat. She also says that it&#39;s not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just staring at her gobsmacked. She&#39;s complaining that she doesn&#39;t have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can&#39;t lie to get sympathy from people. </p>\n\n<p>My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic &quot;I should apologise since I&#39;m more mature&quot;. They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. </p>\n\n<p>I ask them &quot;so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it&#39;s your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Now they&#39;re mad at me too.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I never lost hair, and mine isn't Hashimoto's, just run of the mill hypothyroid that hit in my 30s.  My doctor and I think I must have had off and on issues earlier than that though.  In my 20s, I was so tired at one point that he tested me for Lupus even though I didn't have the other symptoms. But I was also going through a seriously stressful time in my life so part of that exhaustion was probably that and the work hours I was putting in.  A couple of years before my thyroid diagnosis, my allergies went INSANE.  I always had hayfever as a kid, but I suddenly started getting hives.  It worked up to having hives 24/7 for weeks.  They'd merge and get to be dinner plate sized.  He gave me predisone purely as a diagnostic tool, but in those two weeks I started ballooning up (I'm an idiot and didn't know what that does to your appetite).  I also used food to distract from the itching and I think because it DID give me a little energy boost when I was feeling so fatigued.  I ended up on 5 different kinds of allergy meds before I started doing shot therapy.  Since then, both my doctor and I have read literature that says there are studies about a subgroup where an early sign of potential thyroid issues is allergies suddenly going out of control, extreme. I get why this upsets you.  As far as diseases go, I think we're lucky, but it doesn't mean it doesn't affect us and pretending to have it isn't offensive.",

I was eating healthier and exercising. I had switched to smoking cigarettes rather than chewing tobacco (important later). I began to lose weight. It started slow, maybe 10 lbs the first month. By the end of the year, I had lost 100 lbs. Everyone at work, friends, and some family would just gush over how good I looked. But towards the end of that year, my wife and family began to get worried. \n\nMy eyes began bulging a little bit. I assumed it was from weight loss. Then I started to get tremors in my hands. I assumed it was from the nicotine. I set an appointment with my doctor, but it was a month away. I started to get weakness in my thighs when I stood up from a seated position. Then it happened; thyrotoxic myopathy. I was walking up my basement stairs when suddenly my legs gave out. I fell down the wooden stairs onto basically concrete. My whole body shut down. I couldn't move my legs. I couldn't move my arms. I was stuck on the ground for over an hour. My wife finally found me and I went to the ER. My heart was about to beat out of my chest my heart rate was so high. Got a Graves diagnosis not too long after. It seems the the sudden increase of exercise, change of diet, and the addition of cigarettes triggered the hyperactive thyroid. The next few months were riddled with medication changes, thyroid storms, and more myopathy. \n\nMy endo finally settled on a medication. I couldn't do the radiation treatment because my wife was pregnant. The medicine made me gain weight, and FAST. I gained just about all of the weight back in about a year.

Over time, I have witnessed changes that have gradually eroded the welcoming and inclusive environment that initially drew me to Reddit. It is the actions of the CEO, in particular, that have played a pivotal role in my decision to bid farewell.\n\nFor me, Reddit has always been a place where diverse voices could find a platform to be heard, where ideas could be shared and discussed openly. Unfortunately, recent actions by the CEO have left me disheartened and disillusioned. The decisions made have demonstrated a departure from the principles of free expression and open dialogue that once defined this platform.\n\nReddit was built upon the idea of being a community-driven platform, where users could have a say in the direction and policies. However, the increasing centralization of power and the lack of transparency in decision-making have created an environment that feels less democratic and more controlled.\n\nFurthermore, the prioritization of certain corporate interests over the well-being of the community has led to a loss of trust. Reddit's success has always been rooted in the active participation and engagement of its users. By neglecting the concerns and feedback of the community, the CEO has undermined the very foundation that made Reddit a vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nI want to emphasize that this decision is not a reflection of the countless amazing individuals I have had the pleasure of interacting with on this platform. It is the actions of a few that have overshadowed the positive experiences I have had here.\n\nAs I embark on a new chapter away from Reddit, I will seek alternative platforms that prioritize user empowerment, inclusivity, and transparency. I hope to find communities that foster open dialogue and embrace diverse perspectives.\n\nTo those who have shared insightful discussions, provided support, and made me laugh, I am sincerely grateful for the connections we have made. Your contributions have enriched my experience, and I will carry the memories of our interactions with me.\n\nFarewell, Reddit. May you find your way back to the principles that made you extraordinary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNABDad",

If your thyroid isn&#39;t processing what you eat well &amp; the other effects of the condition like fatigue impact your lifestyle, it&#39;s still the condition causing it, not willpower.</p>\n</div>",
