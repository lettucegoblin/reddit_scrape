I didn\u2019t know how to care for my hair until I was in my early 20s - all my childhood years were spent with my hair in a giant poofy triangle, and I spent most of my teen years spending 12+ hours in a salon 2x a year to get Japanese straight perms. </p>\n\n<p>I use some products that are for black hair. My stylist is a curly haired Latina and was the first stylist I ever found who I actually wanted to go back to after my first appointment. I used to <strong><em>dread</em></strong> getting haircuts because I\u2019d spend a fortune to look awful afterwards - even went to a salon once that charged me $200 for a 10 minute trim \u201cbecause you just have <em>so much</em> hair!\u201d Yes. I have so much hair.

        "body": "This may be a lil controversial, but I think using \"cultural appropriation\" is still correct & not dumb when you use it how it was originally supposed to be used.\n\nLike the classic example of wearing headdress to music festivals in the U.S. The folks from the plains tribes have explained its use (worn almost exclusively by men who earned them over a period of time, or granted to someone esteemed (similar to an honorary degree from a college)), and have made it clear that they would prefer headdresses not to be worn by people from outside their tribes. In that case, continuing to do so is cultural appropriation, and the term is being correctly applied.\n\nBut in OP's case, not only did her best friend (a WOC herself) introduce her to the hair care, but obviously she's been actively welcomed at the salons she goes to! Given her hesitancy here, I imagine she wouldn't have continued going if the hairdressers made her feel unwelcome. While hair care & styling are pretty core to the culture of folks of color, it's been made clear in OP's case (and to people p much everywhere) that many folks are happy to help anybody who has the same hair struggles (bc god knows that 3c & above can be a real challenge even when you have a good routine in place- forget about it if you don't). \n\nI think in summary, you just have to look at what the folks of the OG culture are saying. If they're asking you not to and you do it anyway, that's cultural appropriation. If the people are welcoming you and teaching you their traditions (be they haircare or whatever else) & your ~woke~ friends are calling it cultural appropriation... don't worry about it.\n\nI'm sorry I had so much to say, but your comment got me thinking.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This may be a lil controversial, but I think using &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; is still correct &amp; not dumb when you use it how it was originally supposed to be used.</p>\n\n<p>Like the classic example of wearing headdress to music festivals in the U.S. The folks from the plains tribes have explained its use (worn almost exclusively by men who earned them over a period of time, or granted to someone esteemed (similar to an honorary degree from a college)), and have made it clear that they would prefer headdresses not to be worn by people from outside their tribes. In that case, continuing to do so is cultural appropriation, and the term is being correctly applied.</p>\n\n<p>But in OP&#39;s case, not only did her best friend (a WOC herself) introduce her to the hair care, but obviously she&#39;s been actively welcomed at the salons she goes to!

I had my first cut 5 years ago, and it's all I will ever get now. It gives my hair SO MUCH volume, health, and makes it grow back so well. There are a ton of salons that use the DevaCut method, but you don't need to buy the products. The salon I go to usually cuts your hair dry, washes it, and then styles it with Devacurl products, but I just opt out of the wash and style. \n\nThere is also a method called the Rezo cut, also a dry hair cut.  Their website has a search engine to find places near you with trained stylists.\n\nEDITED to add: there are official Deva Curl salons, but I don\u2019t go to those. Not only are they crazy expensive but given the weird way they handled the claims re: their products, I will always choose going to a local small biz.

I\u2019ve been cutting my own hair for about five years now (ever since I moved away from home, my adoptive mom used to cut it for me). Much less expensive than going to see someone and after a while and some coaching from my mom I know what works for my curls. You can\u2019t cut curly hair like straight hair, but somehow hair salons don\u2019t seem to get taught this even though lots of people have curls.</p>\n</div>",

And it would probably cost $25 because you know I want to use local chickens.  Someone is going to be like this isn\u2019t authentic.  Someone else will be like omg this is expensive. And some other dummy will complain that my menu doesn\u2019t have Mac and cheese because supposedly that is all we eat.
