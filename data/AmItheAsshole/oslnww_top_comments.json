He's bed ridden and his family come to see him everyday.\nMIL keeps \"drilling\" what I need to do to make my husband comfortable but does nothing to help. Just visits everyday and sits around expecting to be fed and entertained. Sometimes BIL, his wife & kids join them and turn the house into a mess.\n\nYesterday MIL, her husband and son came again. They checked on my husband then went to sit in the living room for hours. I served them coffee and croissant. Hours later my husband threw up again (2nd time) I had to take care of changing his clothes and cleaning the sheets to avoid infections.\nI was exhausted, I came downstairs and MIL looked at me and asked \" hey where's our dinner?\".\n\nI was shocked that after seeing me go up and downstairs many times and cleaning and bringing new sheets and running the washing machine that she'd expect me to prepare dinner. I'd already eaten a sandwitch at 6 and yogurt ( problems with my stomach and stress and pregnancy made it worse)\n\n\nI pointed at the kitchen and told her to help herself out. She gave me a look then said she didn't expect me to ask *her* to cook dinner at *my* house. I said I didn't expect her to ask ME to cook dinner while I'm taking care of her son. She started arguing about the way I spoke about my husband saying as his partner, *this is the least I could do* and called me unhinged for throwing in her face that I'm helping my husband.\n\nShe got her husband involved asking what his thoughts were on me making guests hungry and forcing them to cook themselves when this supposed to be my duty as a host/home owner. FIL said they could order food and call it a day and yelled at my younger BIL to stop playing and order food but MIL got mad and lashed out criticizing me saying I wasn't up to the challenge of taking care of my home and my guests. I lost it on her and told them to leave since she kept yelling disrupting my husband's sleep. She left after saying she felt sorry for her son and grandbaby with an \"aggressive wife and a mother like me\".\n\nShe told everyone and my older BIL said he understood I'd a lot on my plate but lectured me about how I should have respect for his mom who was a guest. Repeatedly saying if that was his wife she wouldn't have acted this way. He asked me to apologize but I didn't.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

FIL said they could order food and call it a day and yelled at my younger BIL to stop playing and order food but MIL got mad and lashed out criticizing me saying I wasn&#39;t up to the challenge of taking care of my home and my guests. I lost it on her and told them to leave since she kept yelling disrupting my husband&#39;s sleep. She left after saying she felt sorry for her son and grandbaby with an &quot;aggressive wife and a mother like me&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>She told everyone and my older BIL said he understood I&#39;d a lot on my plate but lectured me about how I should have respect for his mom who was a guest. Repeatedly saying if that was his wife she wouldn&#39;t have acted this way. He asked me to apologize but I didn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You weren\u2019t keeping her away from her sick child, she actively chose to avoid him. Likely because she didn\u2019t want to perform any of the basic care activities, such as cleaning him up after vomiting. She wanted the kudos of saying she was visiting her son all day when it sounds like it was around five minutes, and then expecting her nauseous, exhausted, pregnant daughter in law to wait on her hand and foot as well. What a terrible mother she is. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not hanging her out to dry by broadcasting this information as far and wide as you can.\n\nThey were also not guests. Guests are invited. They were not. There is an important distinction between inviting someone into your home for a social occasion, and people visiting someone who is sick. There are two priorities in your home right now: your bedridden husband, and your pregnancy. MIL is not a priority. At all.\n\nIf I were you, I would make it clear your home is not open for social activities right now: you are under emergency measures. Anyone who wants to visit your husband is welcome, but the moment they leave his room, the visit is over and they are not invited to stay, unless they are helping with household chores. When they inevitably complain, you innocently ask why they would want to take your attention away from their sick child? Surely his health and safety is more important? They won\u2019t be able to answer in any way that is reasonable.\n\nAnyone else who complains is told that they are welcome to come and take over the purchasing and cooking of MIL\u2019s dinner. You\u2019ll be amazed how quickly they shut up when they are on the hook for catering to this awful woman.\n\nIf it were me, I would just ban her from your home until she apologised profusely and agreed to follow your rules. You are about to have a child, and if she is this poor a mother, she is going to be exactly the same way as a grandmother. You need to establish this boundary NOW, or you never will. And anyone else\u2019s opinion is moot. Just say to any flying monkeys she sends that this is between you and her and not open for discussion. Repeat as many times as is needed.",

There are two priorities in your home right now: your bedridden husband, and your pregnancy. MIL is not a priority. At all.</p>\n\n<p>If I were you, I would make it clear your home is not open for social activities right now: you are under emergency measures. Anyone who wants to visit your husband is welcome, but the moment they leave his room, the visit is over and they are not invited to stay, unless they are helping with household chores. When they inevitably complain, you innocently ask why they would want to take your attention away from their sick child? Surely his health and safety is more important? They won\u2019t be able to answer in any way that is reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else who complains is told that they are welcome to come and take over the purchasing and cooking of MIL\u2019s dinner. You\u2019ll be amazed how quickly they shut up when they are on the hook for catering to this awful woman.</p>\n\n<p>If it were me, I would just ban her from your home until she apologised profusely and agreed to follow your rules. You are about to have a child, and if she is this poor a mother, she is going to be exactly the same way as a grandmother. You need to establish this boundary NOW, or you never will. And anyone else\u2019s opinion is moot. Just say to any flying monkeys she sends that this is between you and her and not open for discussion. Repeat as many times as is needed.</p>\n</div>",

What a nightmare!</p>\n\n<p>They actually did you a favor giving you this preview as you will be way more vulnerable after giving birth. Set up strict visiting hours and no hosting with snacks, drinks, meals rule from you policy for those who just want to visit your husband like in a hospital setting, and a near open door policy for those who help by providing meals for you both and help with household chores. This is a perfect chance to train the family up on how to actually behave when someone is home recovering. It is incredibly rude to go into someone&#39;s home and expect to be waited on and entertained adding to the work of the caregiver. They have no manners. Good on you for standing up to the lot of them. NTA</p>\n</div>",

OP lives in the Southern US, and her in-laws clearly believe in traditional gender roles. This would be the expectation *today.* \n\nI currently live in a rural, conservative area in the northeast and it's pretty well the expectation here that when someone takes ill, you should only show up if your presence is going to help in some way. Otherwise, you get in, say hi, and leave before you become a burden.\n\nWhen I was in the South, it was pretty similar. Visitors were a bit more common, but they were always brief drop-ins, rarely came empty-handed, and only stuck around if they could help in some way. I brought many a meal to a family after an accident, surgery, birth, etc, and received several after the birth of my eldest. Standard protocol was *do not cross the threshold*, even if invited in, unless doing so will make your host's life easier. They're only offering their hospitality because it's the polite thing to do.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>In the 1950s, MIL would have been expected to bring a casserole or something to help out, not sit on her butt like she\u2019s Queen for a Day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Forget the 1950s. OP lives in the Southern US, and her in-laws clearly believe in traditional gender roles. This would be the expectation <em>today.</em> </p>\n\n<p>I currently live in a rural, conservative area in the northeast and it&#39;s pretty well the expectation here that when someone takes ill, you should only show up if your presence is going to help in some way. Otherwise, you get in, say hi, and leave before you become a burden.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in the South, it was pretty similar. Visitors were a bit more common, but they were always brief drop-ins, rarely came empty-handed, and only stuck around if they could help in some way. I brought many a meal to a family after an accident, surgery, birth, etc, and received several after the birth of my eldest. Standard protocol was <em>do not cross the threshold</em>, even if invited in, unless doing so will make your host&#39;s life easier. They&#39;re only offering their hospitality because it&#39;s the polite thing to do. Graciously decline, and gtfo.

Just schedule a time with the new mom, drop off, say a quick hi, and get the hell out of there. No sitting down to visit or make her feel like she needs to host. No worrying about what her house looks like. When I take my meals, I even text earlier in the day to see if she needs anything like milk or something. \n\nWe also do meal trains when someone is sick, husband or partner is sick, had a death in the family, husband is deployed, is overwhelmed with finals. Of we notice a member seems like they're going through a lot, we reach out and ask if they would accept meals. If people don't have time to cook that week, they pitch in to buy a gift card so she can get food delivered. \n\nIt's hands down the best part of this club. And it's helped us all normalize accepting help, which was very hard for some of us.",

Still, my mom only offered advice when asked so she wasn't the nosy MIL, but was way willing to help every time she was asked. I took the route of telling funny stories about when we were little that may or may not have only been told because they had a helpful hint in them. \"OMG that reminds me of when we...\" \n\nNow that they live close we just grab a kid so the parents can get stuff done. They are more comfortable that way, instead of us just doing stuff without asking. And we have a standing order that we drop everything and get in the car the second SIL calls for help when the new baby comes soon. They live just far enough away that it's an overnight trip so showing up on their doorstep with jammies and a pillow unannounced would probably create bigger problems. \n\nI'm fairly certain my mom will leave the stove on the first time she gets called for help because, \"my babies need me!\" will create a panicked search for her keys... on their hook... by the garage door... at her eye level. Her keys are the only ones that are always on the hook. Dad leaves his in the ignition in the garage and I hide mine from my dad so he doesn't take mine to work when I need it \"because it needs to be driven\" which it does, but let me know first please.
