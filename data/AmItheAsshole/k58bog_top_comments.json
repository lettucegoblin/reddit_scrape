Ask the brother what she said to him, most likely she twisted it into something else to make you out to be snappish (but then again, why ask an invasive question to someone you&#39;re not close to if you&#39;re that easily offended?). If he still doesn&#39;t see the issue then we know where the sister gets it from and avoid both of them. But do not apologize, they are the ones who should be apologizing for being such tactless cruel twats.</p>\n</div>",

And most people who are losing weight due to illness or a disorder aren\u2019t going to recommend it, in my experience.</p>\n</div>",

Unfortunately, I would suggest not saying it.\n\nMany people are uncomfortable about weight or body image, and/or don't want folks commenting on or talking about their bodies or weight to them. I don't think telling people that they dropped some weight has the high odds of positive reception that you may suspect. So many ways it can backfire.
