He simply said &quot;he&#39;s not YOUR son&quot;. I helped raise him since he was 4. Meanwhile all he would ever do is down him and make him feel like shit. I was a stay at home dad and it was some of the coolest times I can remember. Homework, PTA meetings, etc. I do not understand fathers like that and never will. I am so sorry you and the kids had to endure such fucking utter toxic nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>My step son is 18 now and we have always remained close and now that he is an adult, his father is paying the price. He&#39;s cut him out since moving out and he came to me for help. His mom too but I was happy I was bastion for him as well. He can expect that type of Karma if he doesn&#39;t realize what he has in front of him, immortality.</p>\n</div>",

She would do laundry and everything. \n\nWe have our two dogs, a 12 year old mastiff mix and a 12 year old wolfdog. As well as my mother-in-laws dog (Rottweiler, Chocolate lab mix). It took me 3 weeks to talk my wife into us getting one. We have long grain bamboo floors, so we were able to get away with a cheaper robovac. We went with [this model](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079QYYGF1/). Initially it was set up to come on at 2 am and clean everything. But the little alarm that goes off when it gets stuck on something drove me crazy. So now it comes on around 10pm. \n\nMy wife and I both have issues with infertility. We drained our saving's and was gifted us with our first born. As hard as it was, we still wanted another. Unfortunately, the next two pregnancies didn't make it all the way. With our new born now, even as tired and stressed as we are. We can't help but melt when we hold her. Something we thought we wouldn't get to do again. We use a dockatot while she's getting accustomed to sleeping at night. Even on nights where she does well, I still just end up holding her most the night. \n\nOh, and baby diapers are nothing compared to grandma diapers. Nursing home staff don't get paid nearly enough.",
