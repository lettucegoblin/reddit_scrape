He didn't complain about missing time over dinner with his kids and wife, just that wife should have told him (like you tell a 5 yr old out playing) to come to eat, and that also microwaved roast is rubbery (yeah it is, which is why you eat it when it's done).  He's self-centered, obsessing with a game that keeps from interacting with people a whole lot of the day, and spends his time in the bathroom.  I doubt this is depression, just sounds like he's emotionally never matured (or maybe he'll never be) to the point that things like wife, children, hobbies (other than one game), other people, other things are of interest to him.\n\nOP, of course you're NTA here, he is.  He has poor interpersonal skills, doesn't seem to care, and only can blame you for what any other adult human is responsible for: keeping track of things like dinner, wife, children, the rest of interesting things in life.",

It's like I took a vacation and everyone is looking for Mom. Moms been in the bathroom a while.... (6 mins guys, I hear them talking shit and it has been 6 minutes. ) but the husband does still escape to the bathroom with phone, shower with phone, to take a break and falls asleep for 1 to 6 hours.

It sucks even more in my opinion having it and being terrified to leave the house... but here I am, sucking it up, day in and day out. Not letting it show that I'm pretty close to rock bottom... but go wild hubby, waste every second of your time sleeping or on your phone. I know everyone copes differently, but it's been a year since i got the diagnosis, maybe I'm jealous that I can't also escape for me time like that.... but then again, I can have \"Me\" time, away from the kids and him, when the kids don't relay on us for everything. \n\nI have literally started calling HIM out now.

He says all the time how easy everything is... if it is... then, I know... take half of that off Mt plate. He has been a stay at home Dad for over a decade.

I also had severe treatment resistant depression that has been stable since finally finding a med that works for the last 5 years.\n\nHaving also read all the discussion below your comment and not knowing exactly the best place to add my thoughts, rather than try to reply piecemeal, I decided to do it here:\n\nYou can not expect most people to recognise that they are behaving in a way that suggests that they might have a mental illness or a neurodevelopmental condition such as ADHD or autism.\n\nThe vast majority of people are simply too misinformed on what most mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions are, what the most common symptoms are, who they affect, what the treatments are, how the treatments work and what side effects there might be.\n\nFor example, many people still think that girls and women can't have ADHD. Many people think that you can't be autistic if you can make eye contact. Many people think that you can't be happy and have depression. Many people think that having OCD means that you like to clean your house a lot. Many people think that you can't have an eating disorder if you are overweight.\n\nMany people in these examples can include some doctors, including some psychiatrists who are not specialists in these conditions, causing them to gatekeep access to diagnosis.\n\nVery many people think that taking meds is dangerous, addictive, weak, that it will make them a zombie, so many myths and half truths. Meds are a stepping stool, a support that when properly managed will get you to a place where you're able to implement effective coping strategies yourself. Yes, side effects happen and some meds just are not right for everyone. The anti-depressant that has a zombie effect on you might be just right for someone else. There's no way of knowing in advance, unfortunately. But this isn't explained enough by doctors!\n\nI spent most of my life not even knowing that the reason that I just couldn't function was ADHD. Decades of being told that I just needed a 'kick up the butt'.\n\nYes, when I take my Ritalin and it's a good day and my autism  is working with my ADHD not against it, I can get stuff done. On a so so day, I can give myself that push, on a bad day, I struggle to do the bare minimum.\n\nIt's not that I don't want to, I can't. There's a difference. I do want to, that's the worst part. And I can't even do the things that I love.\n\nWhen you are that person, it's not as if you go to bed one day perfectly well and neurotypical and wake up the next morning with completely changed behaviour.\n\nOften, it creeps up on you, there's a slow decline, it accumulates with stressful events too, problems at work, with family, a global health catastrophe lasting over a year that also causes a recession and social solation...\n\nWhen you are at the bottom of the deep, black hole, self-awareness isn't something that you really have anymore.  Yes, you may appear to be selfish from the outside but it's not in a narcissistic way, it's just that you are no longer capable of caring for yourself, let alone anyone else. \n\nTime spent on mindless activities is an escape mechanism, it's avoidance. Not just from responsibility, because you don't  know how to explain that you just can't. But also avoidance of your own feelings, your own thoughts. It's numbing.\n\nI have been this person.

Depending on if the issue is rooted in illness will determine the exact course of treatment and what strategies will likely be more successful.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately there are many reasons WHY he behaves the way he does. It would be literally impossible to be otherwise. The reasons determine the next steps. He doesn&#39;t deserve any more or less sympathy regardless of what the cause is.</p>\n\n<p>For example if this man has ADHD no amount of &quot;self discipline&quot; will magically make him able to understand time the same way neurotypical people do. However he could use medications, use strategies involving timers and routines.</p>\n\n<p>If he is neurotypical it could be because he&#39;s avoiding his family, or feels useless in the kitchen/with kids, or he feels ashamed that he isn&#39;t contributing as much but doesn&#39;t know how to reconcile it.</p>\n\n<p>We should have sympathy for all people. The people in this discussion suggesting he may have a mental illness aren&#39;t making an &quot;excuse&quot; that magically makes what he did better. The man is an adult and is responsible for his actions.</p>\n</div>",
