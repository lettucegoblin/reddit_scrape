        "body": "Any chance your mom is ADD or ADHD?   \n\nI\u2019m a mom with ADHD.  When I hear or see someone go into another room of the house, it makes me remember something I need to do.  As I\u2019m typing this,  I just heard the cat in the laundry room upstairs scratching in her litter box,  which reminded me that I need to put the towels in the dryer. Lol.  My husband has always joked  that I want to be where he is.   We have a large kitchen with an island in the middle so we don\u2019t bump into each other, but somehow end up in the same place.  Course I always beat him there bc being ADHD, once I start doing something, I\u2019m all in at 100 mph.    Used to think it was a coincidence but it happens too often.   I assumed since I would get there first, that he was just in my way.   After analyzing my actions though, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I think that all it takes is a subtle turn of his body for my subconscious to pick up what he\u2019s about to do next and next thing you know, I have this overwhelming desire to wash my hands in the sink or get something out of the fridge.    If your mom has ADHD, your being in the kitchen could just be a trigger reminding her of things she needs to do.   \n\nI also think it\u2019s possible that you are correct in assuming your having ADHD might be the reason you have such a negative reaction to your mom being in there with you at the same time.   First of all, good  for you having a routine bc it\u2019s a key to success when living with ADHD.    My teenage daughters also have ADHD and they don\u2019t like to cook when someone else is around, especially if they are limited on time.   Packing a lunch is simple for most people and only takes 10 min. For someone with ADHD,  it requires focus to stay on track when you have to make a bunch of little decisions.   Your mom distracts you and throws off your rhythm.   I know that all 3 of us get really frustrated and snappy when someone interrupts us when we are doing something alone.   For me, its like I finally got everything in order to do this so don\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m in the zone.   People without ADHD don\u2019t realize how hard it can be to motivate yourself to do something.  It\u2019s just the way we are and we try to respect each other\u2019s alone time.   No reason to get mad when someone snaps bc we understand where it\u2019s coming from as long as they immediately apologize. \n\nMust also say that if this is the thing that bothers you the most about your mom,  then count your blessings.   Please know that I\u2019m not discrediting your feelings, but in the big scheme of things, this situation is no big deal. Im impressed with the ways you tried solving the issue and the way your mom responded. Sounds like you have a good mom and ya\u2019ll have a good relationship,  other than these little blips.   My mom was super strict and controlling which caused a lot of resentment.  Wasn\u2019t until I was in college and heard horror stories about other moms that I realized how lucky I was.    \n\nHope some of this might help.  Since you are 18 now, suggest you check out r/ADHD women .  Not sure this link will work but you can search for it. Great tips and support for all these weird challenges we fave with ADHD.",
