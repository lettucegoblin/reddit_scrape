        "body": "I have very homophobic and transphobic grandparents, and I am very queer. My parents are very accepting, but they knew that my grandparents would probably react very poorly to meeting my girlfriend or learning that fact. There was one point where my mom asked me to hold off from telling them because she was worried they\u2019d get sick from the upset. However, it was always a conversation that we had together, and it was always my choice what I would end up doing- because it\u2019s my life, ultimately. We ended up going really slow, over the course of several years, dropping hints and letting them ask when they were ready. So far I\u2019m not disowned!\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re feeding the fire of racism by strictly insisting your daughter hides her relationship, regardless of whether you\u2019re really alright with it or not. Also, it\u2019s your daughters life. I think YTA for how you\u2019re approaching it. It\u2019s possible to go about this in a different way- sitting your daughter down, explaining the possible outcomes and risks, and letting her make her decisions for herself and with her boyfriend. The way you\u2019ve gone about it, it seems like you\u2019re ashamed of the relationship based on the reactions of others. It\u2019s not your relationship. They are doing something in an area that comes with discrimination and risk unfortunately. True support would be sticking up for them, but if you can\u2019t do that, at least let them make their own choices.\n\nEdit: after writing this I read the other comments and I see a lot of people telling OP that the only thing that would be right is to support your daughter completely, cut off your parents! While I also have this instinct, in the real world this is very hard to do. People are not black and white, all or nothing, good or evil. Most people exist in between. My grandma has literally pulled me aside during a family dinner after hearing that I merely attended a Pride parade and sternly told me that I should never associate with \u201cthose people,\u201d they are sick, and there\u2019s no helping them. This is, obviously, awful. However- my grandma is a very loving person. She spent her whole life taking care of her disabled sister and her family. She is fiercely loyal to our family. She just doesn\u2019t get gay people, and ignorance is the precursor to intolerance. \n\nBurning bridges is not the only road to equality and understanding. If I were to tell my grandparents that if they didn\u2019t respect me right now as I am, then they are unequivocally awful people and I am not speaking to them anymore- that would not pave the way to understanding. It\u2019s a slow process, and it\u2019s one that requires patience and understanding from both sides. \n\nI am saying this with the caveat that it puts a huge burden on the person trying to handle the racist/homophobic/transphobic/intolerant person, and that it\u2019s totally valid to need to cut people off for our own wellbeing. However, this is not the only way to go about things, and if you can handle it, it\u2019s worth a shot.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I have very homophobic and transphobic grandparents, and I am very queer. My parents are very accepting, but they knew that my grandparents would probably react very poorly to meeting my girlfriend or learning that fact. There was one point where my mom asked me to hold off from telling them because she was worried they\u2019d get sick from the upset. However, it was always a conversation that we had together, and it was always my choice what I would end up doing- because it\u2019s my life, ultimately. We ended up going really slow, over the course of several years, dropping hints and letting them ask when they were ready. So far I\u2019m not disowned!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, you\u2019re feeding the fire of racism by strictly insisting your daughter hides her relationship, regardless of whether you\u2019re really alright with it or not. Also, it\u2019s your daughters life. I think YTA for how you\u2019re approaching it. It\u2019s possible to go about this in a different way- sitting your daughter down, explaining the possible outcomes and risks, and letting her make her decisions for herself and with her boyfriend. The way you\u2019ve gone about it, it seems like you\u2019re ashamed of the relationship based on the reactions of others. It\u2019s not your relationship. They are doing something in an area that comes with discrimination and risk unfortunately. True support would be sticking up for them, but if you can\u2019t do that, at least let them make their own choices.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: after writing this I read the other comments and I see a lot of people telling OP that the only thing that would be right is to support your daughter completely, cut off your parents! While I also have this instinct, in the real world this is very hard to do. People are not black and white, all or nothing, good or evil. Most people exist in between. My grandma has literally pulled me aside during a family dinner after hearing that I merely attended a Pride parade and sternly told me that I should never associate with \u201cthose people,\u201d they are sick, and there\u2019s no helping them. This is, obviously, awful. However- my grandma is a very loving person. She spent her whole life taking care of her disabled sister and her family. She is fiercely loyal to our family. She just doesn\u2019t get gay people, and ignorance is the precursor to intolerance. </p>\n\n<p>Burning bridges is not the only road to equality and understanding.

Your avoiding view is trully telling of  how you actually really feel about it. You don&#39;t like  her dating a black guy, but have to tolerate it until she&#39;s over it. And it&#39;s ok, you have your views and she has hers. Such is the life.</p>\n</div>",

Who\u2019s to say she and Jamal will break up? Perhaps they will, or perhaps he\u2019s the one. Don\u2019t assume though. The thing is, he\u2019s a major part of her life. He\u2019s a human being with feelings. And he shouldn\u2019t be treated like he\u2019s something to be ashamed of. She shouldn\u2019t be treated like her boyfriend is an embarrassment. How demeaning. \n\nExplain to her the reaction she will face and let them decide whether they\u2019re ready to face it or not. Support them. My mother always supported my mixed relationship but my grandfather is of that older generation who does not. I was nervous of his reaction, but we were serious and he either had to accept it or not. I stood by my now-husband when he expressed concern and told him I did not care who approved or didn\u2019t approve because I wasn\u2019t living my life for them. HE made me happy. If my family loved me, they would accept me and who I loved because I was not going to hide my boyfriend like I was ashamed. My mother knew how her father was but you know what? \n\nShe supported me. She helped me break the news. She was not ashamed of my husband and showed her acceptance in her actions. \n\nMy grandfather never said anything to my face. He said some unpleasant things to my mother about it and she handled it. We let him cool off and I continued bringing my boyfriend around. \n\nMy grandfather got over it. I never had a great confrontation with him, thanks to my mom. But I didn\u2019t hide my man either. He now adores his great grandson. \n\nYou need to support your daughter in your actions and stop being embarrassed. You may not want to upset your parents, but they have to come around or not. If they cut her off, they cut her off. You can love them as your parents but have a backbone and put action in your words. Be happy Anna is happy. Tell your parents the same. Anna knows the possible consequences and if she\u2019s ready to tell them then stand by her and Jamal and make sure that man feels accepted by at least one part of her family! \n\nI am beyond grateful I didn\u2019t have to deal with this with my parents. As I said, I had some disapproving family but I gave zero fucks about them. If you don\u2019t accept my husband you don\u2019t accept me. Anna may feel the same. \n\nBTW my mother is conservative. You don\u2019t have to be liberal to accept your daughter and her boyfriend.... don\u2019t care what everyone else thinks in the community. Because they\u2019re wrong.",

My mother knew how her father was but you know what? </p>\n\n<p>She supported me. She helped me break the news. She was not ashamed of my husband and showed her acceptance in her actions. </p>\n\n<p>My grandfather never said anything to my face. He said some unpleasant things to my mother about it and she handled it. We let him cool off and I continued bringing my boyfriend around. </p>\n\n<p>My grandfather got over it. I never had a great confrontation with him, thanks to my mom. But I didn\u2019t hide my man either. He now adores his great grandson. </p>\n\n<p>You need to support your daughter in your actions and stop being embarrassed. You may not want to upset your parents, but they have to come around or not. If they cut her off, they cut her off. You can love them as your parents but have a backbone and put action in your words. Be happy Anna is happy. Tell your parents the same. Anna knows the possible consequences and if she\u2019s ready to tell them then stand by her and Jamal and make sure that man feels accepted by at least one part of her family! </p>\n\n<p>I am beyond grateful I didn\u2019t have to deal with this with my parents. As I said, I had some disapproving family but I gave zero fucks about them. If you don\u2019t accept my husband you don\u2019t accept me. Anna may feel the same. </p>\n\n<p>BTW my mother is conservative. You don\u2019t have to be liberal to accept your daughter and her boyfriend.... don\u2019t care what everyone else thinks in the community. Because they\u2019re wrong.</p>\n</div>",

It\u2019s not a liberal thing to approve of Anna and Jamal, it\u2019s just a normal, moral thing. If you have something against him solely for being black, that\u2019s not something up for debate like political issues, that\u2019s just being shitty. </p>\n\n<p>What OP meant was \u201cI\u2019m not the type of person to usually approve of interracial dating, but I guess I\u2019m not super against it either. I just don\u2019t want <em>my</em> baby dating a black boy!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Use whatever excuse you want, racist grandparents, racist society, whatever.

It likely wasn\u2019t as aggressive as a typical come to Jesus meeting, and it sure wasn\u2019t an actual conversation about how race should have no factor in literally any of these discussions.\n\nTl;dr: OP is either mildly racist or conforming to a mildly racist community in the hopes of maintaining social status, inheritance status, or both.
