It's also borderline (if not outright) abuse if they don't allow you to have enough clothing to protect yourself from the weather, such as a coat to keep you from freezing or getting rained on, or proper footwear for the environment. It's hilarious that this backfired.  \n\nNow for some aunt-y nagging (can't help myself, sorry): \n\n* When smoking, ALWAYS make sure that you know who you're smoking with and what you're smoking. Make sure that they're someone you can trust in case the pot hits you too hard. And that they're not going to slip something harder in there. On the topic of alcohol - never get blackout drunk. There's no reason for it and you can't enjoy the alcohol's taste that way. Only get drunk or buzzed if you can trust the person(s) you are around and ALWAYS make sure to have someone who can safely take care of you and take you home. DDs are awesome.  If you need to be the DD, be the DD and never hesitate to step in if you see someone doing something unwise or something they may regret when sober. It would be best if you waited to smoke or drink until you were older, but I remember what my siblings and I were like when we were young. It's foolhardy to just tell you not to do something and not give advice on how to be responsible. Just make sure to be safe and never do anything harder than pot or drink until you black out. \n* ALWAYS carry condoms with you. You never know when you will need them and it's better to have them on hand then to have unprotected sex. I know that there's still some stigma about teenagers and women carrying them, but ignore all that noise. Carrying condoms and insisting that your partner wear them is a sign of a strong person who values her own body. If you are already on birth control, unless you know that your partner is STD free, use a condom. It can't prevent all STDs but it can prevent quite a few. If you can't afford them, hit up your local Planned Parenthood or community health centers.

You get sole say over who you kiss or sleep with. Don't let anyone pressure you into things you don't want to do. Listen to your inner voice. If it's saying that it doesn't want to do something, then don't do it. If it's saying that it does want to have sex or kiss someone, then feel free to do so - just protect yourself and make wise decisions.

You definitely deserved to have a punishment here, but your parents took it overboard by taking away nearly all your clothes.

NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA story:  My daughter's father (we are divorced) kept taking her car away for every single thing, with the last thing being that he was mad that he stopped by her dorm to say hi, just two (maybe 3) days after she had moved in.  OK so he was struggling with her going away to college... Fine.  But don't just show up after she has been gone only two days.  He should have checked with her first.  Anyway, she had gone to see her boyfriend, so he got mad and took her car away yet again.  What if she needed to go to the store or the doctor?  Anyway, so I asked if she wanted my hooptie to drive in case of emergency.  I thought she'd be too embarrassed, but no.  She wanted it.  Well a couple weeks later he saw her driving around in it and got mad and threatened something else.  I forgot what.  My husband said let's just buy her a car, so we gave her a price range and let her pick it out as long as it had good safety and reliability ratings.  I told her that the car would be taken away only for car related things such as speeding, DUI, etc.  That was over 4 years ago and she was never any problem.  I don't like punishment that is only meant to hurt and humiliate!  My mom took my phone away in 8th grade because of poor grades.  It was appropriate since I never did homework or studied because I was constantly on the phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for that huge story, but OP, I think you're pretty clever.

        "body": "Speaking as someone whose younger siblings did lots of stupid shit in their teens, this is a very bizarre punishment for that particular offense. Most parents try to make the punishment fit the crime/let the kid see the consequences of their action---my parents would forbid my sister from going out with her friends when they found out she had done sketchy shit last time she went out with the friends, for example. I have no idea how taking away your clothes would teach you a lesson about *smoking weed.* Sounds to me like a weird power play more than an attempt at actual discipline; they have only themselves to blame for the fact that it hasn't worked out the way they wanted. You're NTA for your response to the punishment, though you really shouldn't be smoking weed at your age, since your brain is still developing and what little research there is about the effect of weed on a developing brain suggests that it isn't great for you.",

I personally found myself partaking in it a bit too heavily when I was 19-20, and it was impacting my grades and motivation a bit. I was using it daily, and was often smoking alone, which isn't a great habit. I made the choice to quit for a while, but started using it again recreationally maybe three years ago.
