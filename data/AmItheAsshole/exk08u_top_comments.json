This happened to me on a few occasions - I was once waitressing at a really shitty cafe (fucking tyrants, worst job/boss ever but I had to make money to study) and we often didn't have enough staff to cover everything. It was only me covering all 21 tables (because my boss had fucked off) and some Dutch people complained how terrible and slow I was (in Dutch); I told them (in Dutch) that I was the only person working and probably wouldn't get lunch so it was the cafe that was terrible. I've done it to the French before as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust because someone can speak a foreign language, doesn't mean they can use it to shit on people.",

        "body": "\"Who says this?\"  Everybody.  Everywhere.  Like many here, I spent many years in restaurants due to the decent pay and flexible hours during school.  I took French all through middle and high school and 2 courses in college.  I learned Spanish from the kitchen.  Since I live very close to a military base, we had a decent amount of part-timers from various branches of military, some former translators or other form of linguist.    \n\n\nWe had customers curse at us, tell us we were stupid, grossly hit on us, you name it, all in whatever their native tongue was.  They automatically assumed that Americans can only speak English (Not the worst assumption), but in this case, we literally had a network of translators walking the floor.  \n\n\nThe worst experience I had was the brief stint I tried selling cars.  I was on a test drive with a couple who basically spent the whole ride telling each other in French how I was sure to take advantage of them, how all salesmen are scum, how I was probably racist against them for not speaking English, etc...  We passed a beautiful super old church in a historic part of town and the wife asked her husband (In French) if he knew the denomination of said church.  I replied \"Methodist\" without thinking and they both just slowly realized I spoke French.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;Who says this?&quot;  Everybody.  Everywhere.  Like many here, I spent many years in restaurants due to the decent pay and flexible hours during school.  I took French all through middle and high school and 2 courses in college.  I learned Spanish from the kitchen.  Since I live very close to a military base, we had a decent amount of part-timers from various branches of military, some former translators or other form of linguist.    </p>\n\n<p>We had customers curse at us, tell us we were stupid, grossly hit on us, you name it, all in whatever their native tongue was.  They automatically assumed that Americans can only speak English (Not the worst assumption), but in this case, we literally had a network of translators walking the floor.  </p>\n\n<p>The worst experience I had was the brief stint I tried selling cars.  I was on a test drive with a couple who basically spent the whole ride telling each other in French how I was sure to take advantage of them, how all salesmen are scum, how I was probably racist against them for not speaking English, etc...

We'd be on a mile long wait list, a line out the door, servers would be serving customers in the entranceway, most customers didn't care. But Lord help us all if a table actually opened up in the middle of the match! Manager would be yelling at me to help bus it before they had walked out the door. And customers would be stopping me asking if they can sit there. Other customers would be trying to sit at the dirty table to \"claim\" it, before I can even clean it. So I'd have to tell them to get up or get out. And then the first 10-15 names on the list had already left, but unless they told me, I'd still have to call the names in order of what I wrote down. But the absolute worst was when a server didn't think I was going fast enough calling out names and instead snatched silverware and menus from me and started yelling \"two tables for 2 on the patio. Any takers?\" One of the parties he took hadn't even put their name down yet, the other had been there for about 10 minutes. And all of a sudden every single waiting customer was in my face screaming and yelling demanding a table and cussing me, (4 foot 9 inch, 17 but looks 14 years old) like a dog. The second I saw my coworker I got in front of him and started screaming and yelling at him (over 6 feet tall) complete with an f-bomb every few words of course. Every customer without a table is staring. And plenty of the other customers were too. We both got sent home. \n\nThe Superbowl was easy after that.",
