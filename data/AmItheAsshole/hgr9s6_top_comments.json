        "body": "I was very concerned when I read this. What I think you need to do is step back from the situation. You need to re-examine your relationship with your friend Joe. Joe knows how you feel about this girl and the fact that he set you up like this is a red flag. Joe's girlfriend used her relationship with him to set you up with chain. Joe is a grown man and if he is easily manipulated by his girlfriend this way. You don't need this as a friend. As 4 Jane this is what you need to do. You need to be straight with her. You tell her you do not have feelings for her. And that you will go no contact with her from now on. And that if she tries to contact you in any way. That you will get a lawyer and called the police for pressing charges on her for stalking and harassment. You might want to consider telling your workplace or your landlord about Jane. Because if you go no contact with her something tells me she may try to show up at your work or your home. Just a thought. for your friend Joe and his girlfriend. You tell your friend Joe and his girlfriend that you need to take a break from them for a while. After what they did I would not trust them as far as I can throw them. And that you need some time to reconsider your friendship with Joe. Even if Joe apologizes for what he's done he's proven he cannot be trusted with his girlfriend around. He fully knew this was a setup. You are an adult and you can find friends elsewhere. Joe is not your family so you do not owe him nothing. It doesn't matter how long you've been friends even if you consider him family. What he done would break the trust I would have in a person. After some time and going no contact with Joe and his girlfriend or low contact. If you do decide to stay friends with Joe. You can start off slowly. You can spend time with him until he can rebuild your trust in him. Away from his girlfriend she is no part of this unless she becomes his wife then it's a whole different story. But until they are married does not need to but in your relationship. Because she has no say so in it whatsoever. Now if you do continue the friendship with Joe. You tell him you do not want Jane around you or to give her any information. Or better yet not to give his girlfriend any information. It till you completely trust Joe don't tell him anything about your personal life. Just go out have beers play pool go to the movies hell even go fishing. If you think the Friendship is worth saving. But if it's not worth saving and you can't fully trust him anymore. Because he is helping this girl stalk you. Then I suggest you get some new friends. Call that lawyer to find out what you can do if Jane does not leave you alone. You can either get a restraining order for a protective order. But if you don't have enough evidence for that you can go to a non-contact order. But if she tries to contact you in any way to social media phone calls or even comes to your workplace or shows up at your house or even through your friends she can get arrested. And when that happens you can get off full restraining order against her. And if that doesn't work I'll say sue for stalking and harassment if not taken seriously.(if I have the money and exhausted all others resources. It might scared her off) You have a right to be happy. When I read this post I was seriously worried about you. You deserve to be with someone that makes you happy. I feel this girl's can keep on coming after you insta turn into full-fledged stalking. So U need to be and watch your back. Please give us an update soon cuz I like to know how you handle the situation.",

I can understand how it would bother OP and on top of the fact that he has already rejected her multiple times. I can all but guarantee that it stung pretty good.

Clearly your friend has the same problem. I mean honestly, what did he expect your reaction to be when you walked in and found out who they set you up with?\n\nActually, I can guess. They probably saw this as a dumb rom-com situation where your annoyance with Jane was actually a cover for your unrealized attraction to her, and if you could just get to know her you\u2019d realize you two were actually perfect for each other. Which, barf. \n\nGood for you for sticking to your boundaries and getting out of a situation that so clearly violated them. Were you rude walking out without saying anything? Yeah, kinda, and if you want to apologize for that, go for it. Even to Jane. Owning one\u2019s mistakes is always a decent thing to do, and it absolutely doesn\u2019t call for more than \u2018it was rude of me to walk out without saying anything, and for that I apologize.\u2019 It\u2019s also completely understandable that you did just leave, and if the alternative was a shouting match in the middle of a restaurant, walking out was also the right thing to do in the moment. I mean, the best case scenario here would have been you walking up to your friends and Jane and saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not comfortable with this date, because Ive already told everyone here that I\u2019m not interested in a relationship with Jane, and I\u2019m not okay with the way you\u2019ve tried to force my hand anyway. Please enjoy your evening, but I\u2019m leaving now\u2019 and then turning around and leaving. At which point your friends would probably still be telling you you were rude and jane\u2019s feelings were hurt; you would just know that accusation was fully baseless instead of mostly so. \n\nAlso: your rudeness in walking out DOES NOT IN ANY WAY excuse the monumental breach of trust of your friend\u2019s decision to try and force you into a date with someone he knew you were not comfortable dating. Because that is a \u2018reconsider the viability of this friendship\u2019 level of consent violation fuck up. \n\nAlso: Jane\u2019s hurt feelings are fully Jane\u2019s problem. Her feelings aren\u2019t hurt by the way you rejected her (again), they\u2019re hurt by the fact that you rejected her (again), and that\u2019s not something she has any right to demand you change, much as she has inappropriately tried. \n\nOne last note that might be helpful generally: if you\u2019re not in a place where you\u2019re interested in dating, don\u2019t accept blind dates, even ones offered in good faith. It\u2019s your right to want to be single, and it\u2019s also not fair to the time and energy of the blind date, who probably is looking for a partner and wouldn\u2019t actually want to invest their energy even for a few hours into a date that is guaranteed not to go anywhere. Not only is it ok to say no, it\u2019s ok to stick to it. If you keep getting pressured after you\u2019ve turned one down, just say you\u2019ve already given your answer and aren\u2019t interested in arguing about it, and change the subject. Every time.",

If u have any questions afterwards, feel free to ask.\n\nFirstly, it's normal to feel guilt in these circumstances. Guilt is a complex emotion - people can feel it when they are completely faultless on a situation. All that does is demonstrate u are a guy with empathy, who doesn't like to see others upset. It doesn't automatically mean u did anything wrong.\n\nBut secondly (regardless of any misplaced guilty feelings u have), u MUST stick to ur guns. To be honest, I'm concerned about Jane's behaviour towards u. I'm hoping it's just immaturity on her part, rather than a full-on stalking situation starting up. \n\nI'm not trying to worry u, as I would lean towards the former (immaturity) atm. But DO keep an eye on this, if she continues her advances. Don't be scared to take more rigorous action against her if it begins to get more out-of-hand. U absolutely did the right thing either way (whether she's a stalker or just immature). \n\nYes, it may have stung her. But u aren't responsible for Jane's feelings - nor the natural consequences of her inappropriate behaviour.  U are actually doing her (and future men she's attracted to) a favour in the long-term. \n\nIf she isn't getting the results she wants, then she is more likely to learn that this behaviour an ineffective method to hook a guy. Feeling upset is a necessary evil for people engaged in problematic behaviour too. If they keep encountering painful feelings as a result of their inappropriate behaviour, then that is also more likely to eventually change their behaviour.\n\nUltimately (if u had stayed/taken pity on her), she would likely have taken that as encouragement. We know she already has a very questionable understanding of other people's boundaries. If u give her any 'hope' at all (i.e. or at least, what she could interpret as 'hope' in her mind - such as staying for dinner) then the situation will just worsen. \n\nShe would likely interpret it as u really ARE getting interested (since it's a 'date'). She will likely see at as u just need 'bringing round' some more. When u refuse her next advances, she would then simply up the ante - convinced she can make u 'back down' again, if she just keeps up the pestering.\n\nThirdly, I don't know for certain what the heck Joe and his girlfriend were doing. However, it's worth remembering that people who are engaged in harassment, can be very manipulative and convincing. They often manage to cause discord between people/make the victim seem the 'bad guy'. In psychology, we call it 'splitting'.\n\nShe could have lied to Joe and his girlfriend, to make it sound like u have  showed more interest in Jane than u admit to. It could even be as deluded as lying about something physical occurring between u. \n\nMaybe she then said (falsely) that she'd like to 'surprise' u at dinner, because u have expressed signs of being increasingly 'into' her (after being physical with her) - and so would enjoy the surprise. The possibilities are endless for what she may or may not have said. \n\nIf so, Joe and his girlfriend might be judging ur decision to walk out against that (false) context. Maybe ask Joe what the heck Jane said, to convince him this was a good idea. \n\nReiterate u have shown no interest in her beyond being an acquaintance (and indeed, remind him how many times u have now clearly rejected her).  Explain that u are concerned about her harassment - and u would prefer it if Joe and his girlfriend didn't enable Jane's unreasonable behaviour towards.  \n\nAs others have commented, if this were a girl suffering this harassment from a man - then it would be likely to be taken far more seriously by friends. But regardless of the genders involved, it doesn't make this behaviour any less concerning or stressful.  \n\nIf Joe cannot understand the problem after u remind him of the factual circumstances (and have disputed any lies she may have told them) - then u may need a break/some distance from him for a while, too.

Surround urself with supportive people.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck with it all.</p>\n</div>",

If someone says \"No, I'm not interested right now because I'm in a relationship\" that's what it means.  Which it appears OP may very well have said.  If that *is* what happened-- again I'm speculating, but OP writes that \"I informed her I was with someone and not interested\" so it might have gone down that way-- Jane is not in the wrong for asking again months later after OP's circumstance had changed.  That is not \"no means yes.\"  \n\nIf you regularly turn down dates with people your are not at all interested in with \"no, I'm not interested in going out with you *now* for <insert reason here>\" I would advise you, woman to woman, to try to stop doing that and suggest that you shouldn't be surprised if in some cases you get a second request for a date.\n\nHowever, and again, please read what I wrote, by the time it got to the blind date thing, someone is clearly delusional.  OP is not the asshole here.\n\nI think where your confusion lies regarding my position is that my understanding of OPs account is that the woman hit on him three times before the blind date incident, but now that I re-read it maybe it was only two times she explicitly asked, so you may have been thinking I was okay with the blind date?  As noted in my earlier post, I think blind date thing was not cool, she should have figured it out by then and OPs friend shouldn't have played along.  But until that point, maybe she was just too obtuse to get the message.",

That is not &quot;no means yes.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>If you regularly turn down dates with people your are not at all interested in with &quot;no, I&#39;m not interested in going out with you <em>now</em> for &lt;insert reason here&gt;&quot; I would advise you, woman to woman, to try to stop doing that and suggest that you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if in some cases you get a second request for a date.</p>\n\n<p>However, and again, please read what I wrote, by the time it got to the blind date thing, someone is clearly delusional.  OP is not the asshole here.</p>\n\n<p>I think where your confusion lies regarding my position is that my understanding of OPs account is that the woman hit on him three times before the blind date incident, but now that I re-read it maybe it was only two times she explicitly asked, so you may have been thinking I was okay with the blind date?  As noted in my earlier post, I think blind date thing was not cool, she should have figured it out by then and OPs friend shouldn&#39;t have played along.  But until that point, maybe she was just too obtuse to get the message.</p>\n</div>",
