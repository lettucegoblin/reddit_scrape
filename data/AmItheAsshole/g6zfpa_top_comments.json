And since the girls don\u2019t have memories of her, I don\u2019t see why they should get to know someone who abandoned 3 vulnerable people for 2 weeks on their own.

Those kids weren&#39;t given a choice about her behaviour, they deserve to get that choice now. The little kids can make that choice when they&#39;re ready.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d tell your sister that she can SEE the kids when <strong>they&#39;re</strong> ready, but in the meantime, she can write them on a regular basis. Personally, I&#39;d choose emails, to avoid the obligation of your home address. And if she can keep that schedule up, then you&#39;ll know that when they&#39;re ready to talk with her, then she at least kept her word for the last 6 months/year/decade. If however, she&#39;s not willing to even agree to that, she knows that she has every intention of failing them again. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let the family bully  you into anything, even if it means losing contact with them, as well. They are, after all, an element of the upbringing of your sister, and not necessarily qualified to decide what&#39;s mentally sound for anyone.</p>\n</div>",

Any helping mom to obtain/see the children without you is a crime.\n\n\\-Let the oldest know what you're doing, tell him you respect his wishes, that you love him, and you're going to protect him. Tell him if she reaches out to tell you right away. I would even consider to get a burner phone, or a child-phone that doesn't have games or anything with just your number in it in case something happens.\n\n\\-It may even be worth calling her parole officer if she has one, and informing your local PD.\n\nIf you want you can even file for a restraining order so if she violates any conditions she can get arrested.\n\nI know all of these precautions seem extreme, but neglectful former parents still often feel entitled to having their children that they abused.\n\nYOU are their protector, you do anything and everything to keep them safe.",

If your sister can get/stay clean for an indeterminate amount of time *and* the children express an interest in seeing her then it would be alright to introduce supervised visits. The children are the priority here, not your sister.\n\n>I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her,\n\nThat is not your responsibility, that's their bio-mom's. She put them in danger, she fostered the oldest's hatred of her, **she left them**. It is not your responsibility to make sure they are there when she decided to come back.\n\n>Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother\n\nTo be blunt again, your family are assholes and don't have the first clue what they are talking about. They can help your sister rebuild her life but they keep the fuck out of any business concerning you and those kids.\n\n>I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison.\n\nImagine being a person that sees this as a bad thing. \n\n>They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them\n\nBullshit. You *might* get away with forcing the two little ones to see her. And by get away, I mean they might not outright loathe you for it until their bio-mom does something horrible to them. But the oldest? He'll hate seeing her, and he'll hate anyone that forces him to see her.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To be blunt, you should never give the kids back, the risk/reward is not in their or your favor at all. If your sister can get/stay clean for an indeterminate amount of time <em>and</em> the children express an interest in seeing her then it would be alright to introduce supervised visits. The children are the priority here, not your sister.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is not your responsibility, that&#39;s their bio-mom&#39;s. She put them in danger, she fostered the oldest&#39;s hatred of her, <strong>she left them</strong>. It is not your responsibility to make sure they are there when she decided to come back.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, and it&#39;s my fault the little ones don&#39;t remember their mother</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To be blunt again, your family are assholes and don&#39;t have the first clue what they are talking about. They can help your sister rebuild her life but they keep the fuck out of any business concerning you and those kids.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I didn&#39;t take them to see her when she was in prison.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Imagine being a person that sees this as a bad thing. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They also told me that it&#39;s my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don&#39;t want to, because that&#39;s what&#39;s best for them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bullshit. You <em>might</em> get away with forcing the two little ones to see her. And by get away, I mean they might not outright loathe you for it until their bio-mom does something horrible to them. But the oldest? He&#39;ll hate seeing her, and he&#39;ll hate anyone that forces him to see her.
