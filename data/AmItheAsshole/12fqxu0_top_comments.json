My birth dad (John) who's 48M and my other dad Dwayne who's 45M. I call my birth dad John, \"Dad\". And I call my other dad Dwayne, \"Pops\". \n\nMy birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages. \n\nSo dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy. \n\nPops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents.\n\nFor a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me \"My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner\" I said sure. I'll tell my family. \n\nSo yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says \"Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready\". She says \"You must be \\_\\_\\_\\_ dad so good to meet you\" and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen \"He's holding the mac n cheese tray\" with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says \"Who's he?\" i said, \"Oh that's my dad\". She said \"I though he's your dad\" she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says \"I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nI genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents \"let's leave\" and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said \"son don't worry this is nothing new haha\" and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep. \n\nSo AITA for not telling?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My birth dad (John) who&#39;s 48M and my other dad Dwayne who&#39;s 45M. I call my birth dad John, &quot;Dad&quot;. And I call my other dad Dwayne, &quot;Pops&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>My birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she&#39;s somewhere in California, idk where or what she&#39;s doing. Haven&#39;t talked to her in ages. </p>\n\n<p>So dad, and pops i&#39;m super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they&#39;ve always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy. </p>\n\n<p>Pops &amp; Dad got married, and we&#39;ve been living an amazing life. I&#39;m probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he&#39;s laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i&#39;m blessed to have them as parents.</p>\n\n<p>For a few months i&#39;ve been dating this girl bella who&#39;s my age. I thought she&#39;s pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me &quot;My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner&quot; I said sure. I&#39;ll tell my family. </p>\n\n<p>So yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says &quot;Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready&quot;. She says &quot;You must be ____ dad so good to meet you&quot; and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen &quot;He&#39;s holding the mac n cheese tray&quot; with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says &quot;Who&#39;s he?&quot; i said, &quot;Oh that&#39;s my dad&quot;. She said &quot;I though he&#39;s your dad&quot; she&#39;s referring to Pops. I say yeah. That&#39;s my pops? And that&#39;s my dad? She pulls me to the side and says &quot;I didn&#39;t know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely didn&#39;t know why, that&#39;d be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn&#39;t matter. But i guess it&#39;s a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents &quot;let&#39;s leave&quot; and they left. I told my parents i&#39;m sorry and they said &quot;son don&#39;t worry this is nothing new haha&quot; and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep. </p>\n\n<p>So AITA for not telling?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This relationship would've been found to not be fitting due to her and her parents' views, it would've never have come to a meet-the-parents-night that wasn't going to work, etc. and you both could've been living separate lives with people more suited or on your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I \\*do\\* lean towards maybe you are an AH for it.

No.  \n\n\nShould you not hide things and cut off a relationship that's not going to work because of a partner's prejudices instead of avoiding addressing them just to wait until it can be a potential-scene, hopefully not (hopefully so?

        "body": "You would think it would have come up in conversation beforehand. OP has an outstanding relationship with both his dads and his mom bailed on him. I would think this would have been something he shared before \"meet the parents\". If he had a 650lbs parent living on a mattress in the living room, I would think that would have been communicated before to avoid awkward reactions. Bella reacted badly but maybe she was shocked and embarrassed herself. Not EVERYONE is homophobic because they have an awkward reaction.

        "body": "So at the point where she was like \"why didn't you tell me?!\" I kinda was like \"mild yta\" because we're still in a world where people will assume straight parents, and by not telling her you led her into an awkward situation, even if everyone had been cool about it.  She's probably a little nervous meeting your parents, and this sets her up to feel like an ass for her assumption, which is really not a mean-spirited assumption.  It's more than reasonable for her to expect that you would have mentioned gay parents before she met them in a setup like this. \n\nFurthermore, it could have been a disaster because she might have been cool and her parents a couple of homophobes which would have really put her in a rough situation. The way to deal with homophobia is not to blindside an ally into a situation like that.\n\nIn fact, I'm still not sure she's a homophobe herself... Maybe she just felt like you set her up in a game show, where she would have to confront her own parents.  Or maybe she hates what her parents are like, but she doesn't have any other support, and she can't take the financial or emotional risk to alienate them right now.  So her response may have been a homophobic one, or it may have been \"oh shit how am I gonna pay my rent?!\" that shit is real. \n\nAnd also... Your dads may have been through all this before, but it's still kinda shitty for you to just take the risk for them. Again, they are handling it just fine, and this is a learning moment for you to see how awful the world can be. But seriously man... What if they weren't OK with this? What if it really hurt them to see this shit go down? Why would you take that risk?  Be glad it worked out as it did. \n\nThe top comment is \"when did she mention her straight parents?\" and that's awesome. I think most of us wished the world worked like that.\n\nBut it doesn't.  And you should be aware of that.  There are times when you will unexpectedly need to stand up for what you believe in, when you need to put other people on the spot, when comfort and decorum aren't improtant.\n\nBut this was not one of those times. With 20/20 hindsight, it worked out. But man, it could have been a hurtful painful moment for your dads, and maybe it actually was for the gf (though... who I doubt is cool from what you wrote).\n\nThis is a learning moment for you.  You need to figure out when it's appropriate to put people on the spot, and this was not one of those times.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So at the point where she was like &quot;why didn&#39;t you tell me?!&quot; I kinda was like &quot;mild yta&quot; because we&#39;re still in a world where people will assume straight parents, and by not telling her you led her into an awkward situation, even if everyone had been cool about it.  She&#39;s probably a little nervous meeting your parents, and this sets her up to feel like an ass for her assumption, which is really not a mean-spirited assumption.  It&#39;s more than reasonable for her to expect that you would have mentioned gay parents before she met them in a setup like this. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it could have been a disaster because she might have been cool and her parents a couple of homophobes which would have really put her in a rough situation. The way to deal with homophobia is not to blindside an ally into a situation like that.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I&#39;m still not sure she&#39;s a homophobe herself... Maybe she just felt like you set her up in a game show, where she would have to confront her own parents.  Or maybe she hates what her parents are like, but she doesn&#39;t have any other support, and she can&#39;t take the financial or emotional risk to alienate them right now.  So her response may have been a homophobic one, or it may have been &quot;oh shit how am I gonna pay my rent?!&quot; that shit is real. </p>\n\n<p>And also... Your dads may have been through all this before, but it&#39;s still kinda shitty for you to just take the risk for them. Again, they are handling it just fine, and this is a learning moment for you to see how awful the world can be. But seriously man... What if they weren&#39;t OK with this? What if it really hurt them to see this shit go down? Why would you take that risk?  Be glad it worked out as it did. </p>\n\n<p>The top comment is &quot;when did she mention her straight parents?&quot; and that&#39;s awesome.

        "body": "This. I used to work in the wedding industry, and one of our pre-wedding questionnaire Q's is \"tell us about any situations or appropriate history we need to made aware of as to not embaress anyone.\" For example - no one told us the groom's father was freaking DEAD! So when family picture time came around,  I'm standing in the middle of the church yelling for Mr. GroomDad. When I turn around, everyone is staring at me with horrified looks on their faces, and then someone whispered, \"He's deceased.\" \ud83d\ude33\n\nSo because very simple  information wasn't shared, I unintentionally upset the Groom's little sister to the point of sobbing hysterics, embarrassed myself, and annoyed the rest of the groom's family. All could have been avoided - the groom's response later was \"sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.\"\n\nAnyway, back to the OP - she overreacted, but embarrassment on her behalf as well as your Dad and Pop's could have been avoided with a simple conversation.  The actual words don't even have to be said.  You could've just shown some pics of you growing up. There is nothing wrong with being open with your partner just as there is nothing wrong with having 2 amazing dads. \n\nHave you spoken since? Did you find out if she was just pissed at you for not telling her and she felt embarrassed? Or did she leave because she's a bigot?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This. I used to work in the wedding industry, and one of our pre-wedding questionnaire Q&#39;s is &quot;tell us about any situations or appropriate history we need to made aware of as to not embaress anyone.&quot; For example - no one told us the groom&#39;s father was freaking DEAD! So when family picture time came around,  I&#39;m standing in the middle of the church yelling for Mr. GroomDad. When I turn around, everyone is staring at me with horrified looks on their faces, and then someone whispered, &quot;He&#39;s deceased.&quot; \ud83d\ude33</p>\n\n<p>So because very simple  information wasn&#39;t shared, I unintentionally upset the Groom&#39;s little sister to the point of sobbing hysterics, embarrassed myself, and annoyed the rest of the groom&#39;s family. All could have been avoided - the groom&#39;s response later was &quot;sorry, I didn&#39;t think it was necessary.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the OP - she overreacted, but embarrassment on her behalf as well as your Dad and Pop&#39;s could have been avoided with a simple conversation.  The actual words don&#39;t even have to be said.  You could&#39;ve just shown some pics of you growing up. There is nothing wrong with being open with your partner just as there is nothing wrong with having 2 amazing dads. </p>\n\n<p>Have you spoken since? Did you find out if she was just pissed at you for not telling her and she felt embarrassed? Or did she leave because she&#39;s a bigot? Or maybe she felt she needed to have a talk with her parents beforehand. </p>\n\n<p>My parents are not bigots, but man, they are Def embarrassing.

It&#39;s not OP\u2019s parents&#39; job to be subjected to random homophobes so he can virtue signal about how <em>he&#39;s</em> such a good &quot;ally&quot; that he doesn&#39;t even think to ask.</p>\n</div>",

Heck with her ingrained prejudice he could have told a story with both dad and pops in it and she wouldn&#39;t have necessarily twigged to there being two men and not one. </p>\n\n<p>And also, for what it&#39;s worth, my gay partner has surprise introduced me as his partner or now husband to three people from his past now.  The eyes get wide and they get flustered, and one person acted the way the girl did.  So I don&#39;t declare this as an obvious fake.</p>\n</div>",
