There are plenty of kids who don't get birthday parties because their family can't afford it, and most of them have never done anything this awful. It's an absolutely appropriate punishment - it's something he cares about being taken away as a result of his actions taking something someone else cares about away from them. And I'd explain it to him that way and then add that he's lucky that, unlike what he did to his stepbrother, he can have another party another year. The treasured possession that belonged to your stepson's dead brother can *never* be replaced. Even if he was made to replace that hoodie, it wouldn't be a suitable replacement because it can never be the hoodie your stepson's brother wore.\n\nThat said, the action was cruel and heartless, but you need to have a look at *why* it happened. It sounds like your son is jealous that you've taken his stepbrother under your wing, and that jealousy needs to be dealt with. Once a little time has passed - so your son doesn't associate it with being rewarded for those actions - I'd suggest going and doing something special with your son to show him that you may have a strong bond with your stepson, but that doesn't take away his place in your life.\n\nBoth kids could do with some therapy if you can afford it. Your stepson so he can process his grief better, and your son so he can deal with whatever is going on in his head.\n\nAnd seriously, your son may try to retaliate for his birthday party being taken away, even though it was a direct result of his own actions. Teenagers aren't best known for being rational anyway, and your sons actions have shown that rationality is definitely not something he's strong on. Keep a really close eye on anything else that belonged to Connor, and anything that belongs to your stepson.

Of course there will be adjustments with new family members living in the household, but how are you managing those adjustments and how are you handling taking the time you used to spend with your son on your step-son?\n\nHe's acting out and punishment is probably not the best idea.

If you can't resolve it between the two of you, maybe some family counseling can help. But he's clearly acting out because of the family change. And that's pretty understandable - especially if there's no plan to work toward blending the families better.\n\nSecond, as a person who lost a sibling, I will tell you that Derek needs some therapy to help him move past this. There's nothing wrong with him keeping reminders of his brother's around, but he's wearing the hoodie as a security blanket.

It's unhealthy and really detrimental to this kid to continue to grieve like this during such important developmental years in his life. It will stunt him emotionally if he can't learn how to better cope and move past it. And carrying around a security blanket after years is a big sign that he's not moving past it in a healthy way.\n\nYou need to sit down and talk to your son to see what's going on with him and how he feels about the expanded household. Canceling the party is a bit much, too. You can still show there are consequences for his actions and find a reasonable punishment for the situation, but you're going to have to help your son work through his troubles in the long run.",

I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. Its safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything's which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest' type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most if the time. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say \"OK I get it\" and \"I won't do it again\".\n\nDays ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.\n\nHours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\nHe pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you married, you also forced him (bio son) to join a family that he might not have wanted to be part of.  It can be very difficult to spend years morning a person you never met, and he seems to have to deal with that constantly.\n\nWhen you realized how much attachment your stepson had to this hoodie, you and your wife should have found a new one just like it or very similar.

This is a tough lesson to learn at a young age, but it isn't healthy to spend your youth morning for someone.  I'm not saying cutting up the hoodie was the correct way to do it, but it seems like he can't let go and needs some constructive help to move on.  If there is any more clothing or items that were owned by the deceased it is time to \"put them up\" for safe keeping.",

That doesn't mean no consequences, there are going to be consequences for horrible actions (and let me say that I'm disgusted by what Leo did) - but punishment is not necessarily the same thing as consequences or discipline.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that when a caregiver decides to teach a child (or anyone decides to teach anyone) by getting back at them, making them suffer for what they did, this is really a sort of revenge. Yes, it's with the purpose of teaching a lesson, but it's about inflicting suffering. Now, especially in a young brain, when we inflict suffering on someone they immediately see only their own suffering, and it makes it almost impossible for them to learn the lesson you're actually trying to teach.\n\nSo a child that's regularly punished may well learn not to break certain rules, because they wish to avoid the consequences, but they're doing it for purely selfish reasons. They may well still break those rules if they can do it without being found out. They haven't learnt the lesson you want them to learn. Their obedience, if you get it, is completely self serving.\n\nFor example, if a small child throws a toy at someone, and you speak to them about it and explain how it hurt the other person, their focus is on the other person. If they do it again, you may take the toy away as they have no impulse control and you want to prevent it from happening again. They may be sad about this, and you don't want your child to suffer (counterproductive) so you comfort them and explain that it's just because you're worried they might be tempted to throw again and you don't want someone to get really injured. This is a consequence that makes sense. If you can keep your child feeling loved and safe they are much more likely to remember that throwing things hurts people.\n\nOr, when they disobeyed by doing it again you may have responded in anger, taken the toy and told them they could no longer have ice cream. This makes the child instantly think about themselves and how sad they are not to be allowed ice cream, and think about how you're being cruel to them by telling them they can't have something. They may wish they hadn't thrown the toy again but not because they even remember what you said about it hurting, just because they know that you're stopping them have what they want. They've lost their toy and their ice cream, they're miserable, they feel less connected to you, and they've learnt nothing.\n\nIn short, the punishment makes them self absorbed.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to toddlers, but teenagers and adults, too. Can you think of a time when you did something you would have felt bad about, but then the other person responded a way that was so much worse that it erased your empathy and replaced it with anger?\n\nThis isn't to say that your son should get his party. I wouldn't let those people into my home after what they did to your stepson either. But I think when someone does something awful, if we care about teaching them, our focus needs to be on helping their understanding, rather than vengeance.\n\nThere are natural consequences to what he's done. His step brother will probably never forgive him. You're disappointed in him. And I assume your wife is very upset, too. There are also logical consequences - you doing want his friends in your house. As far as anything further, I would insist on family therapy, with just you two at first, to talk about what happened and how you feel about what he did. My focus would be on bringing out the guilt he should feel, because what he did was despicable. If he can feel guilt and shame for his actions, he's learning, and he won't want to do anything like it again.\n\nI'd then encourage him (only once he was genuine remorseful) to come up with a way to try to make it up to his step brother - not as a punishment or penance, but because he genuinely cares and wants him to feel better. An act not about Leo, but about his step  brother. He'd need to understand that he might not be forgiven, but if he could do anything to make amends, forgiven or not, that would be only right. The focus is on his step brother's pain.\n\nAt the moment, he will not be sitting in his room imagining how his step brother might feel, he'll be sitting there seething about his party and trying to figure out if there's any way he can fix it for himself - sneak out to do something else, or convince you to back down, what can he do to ensure his birthday isn't ruined? This is where his mind will be.\n\nBy making the cancelled party a punishment, an act of vengeance, you've made Leo a victim in his mind.\n\nAt this point, it's certain that the party shouldn't and won't take place. However, I think you can still repair your connection with Leo and get the therapy, and talk to him about the real consequence of his actions, which isn't losing his party, it's hurting a 12 year old deeply, and disappointing his family.  I would really focus the cancelled party thing on not wanting his friends over, and still do something to mark his birthday, so you move him away from the idea that he's a victim of your anger, and onto the idea that you have valid reasons for feeling the way you do.\n\nI know this was an ESSAY, but I hope it makes sense. This wasn't just the ramblings of an eccentric, this is actually based on the most current research in psychology and child development. We know that traditional punishment stunts empathy and teaches selfishness and dishonesty. Our culture has followed the ideals of punishment as consequence for so long that it's so deeply ingrained in us all - it's so hard for us to look at an act as horrible as this and think that it could go without punishment. It seems crazy. But hopefully it makes sense, when you look at what you actually want to achieve with your lesson.",

(I had to run out of the apartment barefoot in December to get away.)\n\nLater, I was able to arrange a day to come get my stuff. Only it wasn't all there. He explained that he had kept a box of my most sentimental items, including a gold necklace that belonged to my cousin who died when we were both 21. I forgot what he wanted to use that box as leverage for, but his idea was that he would give it back once whatever it was had been completed. (I think it might've been to pay the last utility bill or something \u2014 something stupid that I was obviously going to do.) He actually brought out the box and opened it to show me what I couldn't have.\n\nHe thought he could use my grief to control me. But this time he was wrong. I turned around, walked to the apt manager's apt, and asked to use her phone to call the police. She said, \"I think he wants to talk to you...\" I turned around and there he was, handing over my box of things. All I'd had to do all along was stand up to his bullying.\n\nAbout a decade after that he killed himself. He had gotten into another relationship, been just as abusive to her, and then killed himself when she left.\n\nMy point is that your son is headed down a very destructive path. He needs a shit ton of help or he'll just keep hurting people until he destroys himself.",

Even if you put your family on a desert island, he'd still be a bully. That comes from within.\n\nHe needs to see a therapist if he isn't already because this is *not* typical or acceptable behavior from a 16 year old.\n\nIf your son had confidence in himself, his friends wouldn't be able to influence him in a negative way. He'd instead be the positive influence on them.\n\nI once taught two brothers. The older was, to put it nicely, a snot. That came from his dad only ever paying attention to him if he was doing sports or in trouble. Little brother followed in his footsteps because he thought his big bro was \"cool\".\n\nI explained to him the difference between popular and cool & that a leader *leads,* they don't follow, so if he wanted to be the big man on campus someday, he should work on his leadership skills & elevating those around him.\n\n& he did.\n\nAlso his big bro stopped being such a wad after we had a few conversations but it was a heck of a lot harder because he was already into puberty by the time we met.\n\nIt's going to be hard convincing him to turn the rudder but you can do it. Patience & understanding. Listening & talking to them like they're the complex people they really are. I know it probably sounds a little \"hippie dippy\", as the parents I dealt with often called it, but it really does work.\n\nGood luck.",
