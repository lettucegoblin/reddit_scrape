If she disapproves of his lifestyle then maybe reconsider the marriage. If it is only her parents/relatives then I can understand. \n\nIt doesn't seem like she is trying to insult your son or demean him but would rather not put him in a situation where she knows how her family will react in a negative towards him. Again I suggest the talk because if she does feel this way it might be prudent to talk with your son to get his opinion. Basically telling him \"we dont mind, actually we support you as you know, but some of the older generation might do whatever they can to make you feel unwanted or insulted for being who you are.\" \n\nThat way you manage to get both inputs on it without the glaring prejudices of the in-laws and you three can work it out as a family.",

He is a part of you and you have been there at every moment of his life, do not abandon him now.   Im sure a part of him, as a young man, is worried about what his place will be/ what the dynamic will be with the new family. To do something as abhorred as forcing your son to pretend he is someone else will frighten him and FOREVER drive a wedge between you(As a gay man around the same age I can attest to this).You will never be as close as you once were, he will feel that you are casting him to the side for a new chapter in your life, and putting him in the closet sends him a message that he is not allowed to be a part of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Where does this stop?  Is it only for the wedding?  What about anniversaries, birthday parties, funerals, other weddings, reunions, graduation, thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and every other family event?? She is asking for the wedding now, but soon it will be every time her extended family is around.  \n\nWhat happens when your Son decides to get married?  Will she force you to not post it on Fb so as to hide it from the family?  Will she refuse to go to his wedding?   \n\nWill she go as far as to scrub the house of things that might \"make him look gay\" for when her parents come over?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Your son has been dating his bf since he was 18 and as you stated is now 22.  You have been with your fiance for two years.   Your son's bf has been part of your life longer then she has. Lets presume that if your child is fine with hiding in the closet for this(spoiler, he wont be cool with it),his bf will not be and you forcing this on them could jeopardize/end their relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>...nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet.\n\n It should bother you,  You need to sit down and have a long and difficult talk with your fiance. This is a problem for her family. Rather then her asking you to hide your son away and disguise him to your family and hers, you need to tell her that cant happen.  She needs to have a talk with her parents and tell them in advance, that her son in law is gay and that they as her parents need to respect her future step son, husband and family.  She needs to tell them he is gay and that it is not changing.  For your wedding her parents need to get the fuck over it and enjoy the moment you two are about to experience.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would your parents think of you if you force their only grandchild to be unhappy and ashamed during family events? \n\nHe is your son.  You will be a pathetic excuse of a father, husband and human being if you force your twenty two year old son to hide in the closet on your wedding day.    Man up and make those two faggots your groomsmen.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're not the asshole, but if you go through with this you will be.  tbh, I really hope for an update on this.",

Will she refuse to go to his wedding?   </p>\n\n<p>Will she go as far as to scrub the house of things that might &quot;make him look gay&quot; for when her parents come over?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>3) Your son has been dating his bf since he was 18 and as you stated is now 22.  You have been with your fiance for two years.   Your son&#39;s bf has been part of your life longer then she has. Lets presume that if your child is fine with hiding in the closet for this(spoiler, he wont be cool with it),his bf will not be and you forcing this on them could jeopardize/end their relationship.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&gt;...nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet.</p>\n\n<p>It should bother you,  You need to sit down and have a long and difficult talk with your fiance. This is a problem for her family. Rather then her asking you to hide your son away and disguise him to your family and hers, you need to tell her that cant happen.  She needs to have a talk with her parents and tell them in advance, that her son in law is gay and that they as her parents need to respect her future step son, husband and family.  She needs to tell them he is gay and that it is not changing.  For your wedding her parents need to get the fuck over it and enjoy the moment you two are about to experience.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What would your parents think of you if you force their only grandchild to be unhappy and ashamed during family events? </p>\n\n<p>He is your son.  You will be a pathetic excuse of a father, husband and human being if you force your twenty two year old son to hide in the closet on your wedding day.    Man up and make those two faggots your groomsmen.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not the asshole, but if you go through with this you will be.  tbh, I really hope for an update on this.</p>\n</div>",

She needs to tell them that she expects them to be on their best behavior regardless or they will be kicked out. Because if fiance is allowed to bring her homophobic parents (a type of person that typically makes EVERYONE uncomfortable) you should be allowed to invite your sons boyfriend, and honestly potential son in law.\n\nIt's right of you to feel uncomfortable about this and to question.

But if you leave the thread long enough - things tend to balance out. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d boldly claim that even the radical advices can put things into perspective. We all have our own &quot;normal&quot; which we drive from our everyday life. Sometimes, though, our normal-meters are broken. So when a person writes an issue post on here, and some people tell them &quot;leave, that&#39;s a red flag&quot; - they most likely won&#39;t take the advice at the face value. But they will reconsider if their situation is really normal and be on a lookout for more red flags.</p>\n</div>",

Yeah...I bet that wouldn't sit well with you.\n\nJust as OP cannot force his fiancee to cut ties with her family, she cannot and should not force him to drop a nuclear bomb on his relationship with his son, either.
