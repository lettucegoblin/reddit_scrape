        "body": "\\> I know the title sounds absolutely terrible.\n\nI see that on Reddit a lot lately.  I feel that it's because people on the internet do jump to conclusions a lot, but in this sub it's probably safe to assume that everyone wants to hear the whole story or what are they even doing here?  /r/AmItheAsshole is the wrongest turn at Albuquerque for any Bugs Bunny trying to burrow his way to Headline News.\n\nNTA in the most absolute way.  In fact I personally feel that people of any sex or gender or orientation etc. who do what your ex did to you in the way she likely did it should spend the rest of their lives in a zoo cage on bread and water rations.\n\nGay or straight has nothing to do with it.  That she realized she's lesbian is fairly normal as there is no shortage of people under social pressure who take time to find themselves.  You don't HAVE to be understanding about how that affects you but you ARE understanding so that's not even an issue here.\n\nShe was casual and offhand and lighthearted about doing you serious harm with a false accusation for her own convenience.  Yes, convenience, because potential problems with bigots should not be managed by casually throwing someone else under the bus--that's what the bigots do to lesibans and gays and trans people.  Your ex is an oblivious piece of shit of the kind that normally show a consistent pattern of laying waste to their environment with what she did to you.\n\nShe's angry about you outing her because SHE WAS HIDING THE TRUTH BEHIND HER DELIBERATE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.  That has nothing to do with her orientation or anything else.  It's really the same as the the true story of a woman around here who reported vandalism by Neo-Nazis and instead was falsely charged herself by police, such that a local fringe magazine ended up exposing Grant Bristow, a Canadian intelligence operative who had founded a fucking Neo-Nazi organization as part of some devious scheme of work for the Canadian government; and his power as an intelligence operative had pushed local police to do the blatant opposite of her jobs.  In the context of your ex being lesbian she's just like another Grant Bristow.  I feel that that makes her worse trash than anything.",

        "body": "Oh I can relate, My son was bullied for 3 out of his 4 years in middle school,, because his older brother who was also bullied, recorded the bus driver not just allowing the obvious bullying, driving dangerously and allowing the children to run wildly all over the bus, there was another incident reported by 3 parents including me, where the bus driver hopped out of the bus after running up on a curb catching a bag of leaves in the tire, he hopped out to get the bag and the bus began to role because he did not put the freaking break on. Needless to say and after far too long enough issues got reported that the bus driver was fired, a driver  whom most of the kids loved because he let them run wild.\n\nSorry rambled on but it leads to the back round and what lead to, and indecent and a district wide phone call going out to the parents that one of the buses, had returned to the school, before finishing off the drop off because, a student had a knife. No names were given, no one was hurt, they made that clear.  I was surprised and curios but had not gotten to concerned about it. figured the school had things in hand and we would eventually get details later.\n\n All that changed when I got the call it was my son accused of having the knife. I immediately left to get to the school.   By the time I got there, it was established THERE WAS NO KNIFE, The only thing my son had on him that could even be remotely mistaken and what they claimed prompted the accusation was a clear plastic .05 lead holder filled with replacement lead, for a lead pencil he had. The accusations had come from 2 kids that were on record and had been witnessed bullying my son in the past. Despite the fact the have lied about him before, and again pointing out, though they insisted there was one, There was no knife,  or anything else other then a few other students who agreed with the accusers, the rest had remained silent. The fact that they know the children have been angry and blamed my sons for the former driver being fired.  Despite all this I was told I had to take my son directly to our local ER for him to basically get a psych evaluation and I would be escorted by the school resource officer.\n\n   More then one teacher aware of the bullying said it was ridiculous but along with the accusation of having a knife that had not existed my son was also supposedly making threats with said knife that DID NOT exist. Even the school resource officer reported to the psychologist at the hospital there was nothing substantiated no evidence that supported anything against my son. But because of the nature of the accusation this was standard policy. The DR shook his head and they all there basically conceded it was nothing but a complete waste of time. \n\nMy son was given a clean diagnoses /report what ever you want to call it. And was able to go back to school But here is the thing, that infuriated me the most.  No call was Ever made by the district to clear up the whole thing,  or making it clear to the parents that it was all misinformation a false alarm, and there had never been a threat to anyone.  they did not make the call. And do to this, despite no names being given in the initial call, you know how kids are,  it flew about the school like wild fire and all by my sons few closest friends it was all BS. I thank god it was close to the end of school and given the circumstances the school actually provided my son other transportation to school so he did not have to go back on the same bus again.  The last couple months of that school year had been miserable for my son.\n\nSo yeah even completely BS situation can make and leave a lasting mark and effect on people especially kids.",

I was surprised and curios but had not gotten to concerned about it. figured the school had things in hand and we would eventually get details later.</p>\n\n<p>All that changed when I got the call it was my son accused of having the knife. I immediately left to get to the school.   By the time I got there, it was established THERE WAS NO KNIFE, The only thing my son had on him that could even be remotely mistaken and what they claimed prompted the accusation was a clear plastic .05 lead holder filled with replacement lead, for a lead pencil he had. The accusations had come from 2 kids that were on record and had been witnessed bullying my son in the past. Despite the fact the have lied about him before, and again pointing out, though they insisted there was one, There was no knife,  or anything else other then a few other students who agreed with the accusers, the rest had remained silent. The fact that they know the children have been angry and blamed my sons for the former driver being fired.  Despite all this I was told I had to take my son directly to our local ER for him to basically get a psych evaluation and I would be escorted by the school resource officer.</p>\n\n<p>More then one teacher aware of the bullying said it was ridiculous but along with the accusation of having a knife that had not existed my son was also supposedly making threats with said knife that DID NOT exist. Even the school resource officer reported to the psychologist at the hospital there was nothing substantiated no evidence that supported anything against my son. But because of the nature of the accusation this was standard policy. The DR shook his head and they all there basically conceded it was nothing but a complete waste of time. </p>\n\n<p>My son was given a clean diagnoses /report what ever you want to call it. And was able to go back to school But here is the thing, that infuriated me the most.  No call was Ever made by the district to clear up the whole thing,  or making it clear to the parents that it was all misinformation a false alarm, and there had never been a threat to anyone.  they did not make the call. And do to this, despite no names being given in the initial call, you know how kids are,  it flew about the school like wild fire and all by my sons few closest friends it was all BS. I thank god it was close to the end of school and given the circumstances the school actually provided my son other transportation to school so he did not have to go back on the same bus again.  The last couple months of that school year had been miserable for my son.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah even completely BS situation can make and leave a lasting mark and effect on people especially kids.</p>\n</div>",
