My husband gets home from working 10 hours and within 10 minutes of being home you can bet he is giving me a kiss, asking about my day, taking our six week old out of my arms to love on her, feed her, play with her, everything. <strong>Everyone</strong> needs a break. Even going to work is a nice break from childcare some days, even though I love my daughter dearly and love spending time with her. I hope someday you can find someone who loves you and your baby as much as my husband loves me and mine. My heart breaks for you. You are certainly better off without him though, and so is your son.</p>\n</div>",

Right? But jeez once they start being able to walk and get into stuff around the house, I had to constantly keep my eye on him, turn my back for a sec and he&#39;s like climbing on the kitchen countertops to get snacks, or drawing on the walls or couches, then going out with him if he sees the toy section in the store he&#39;ll sit there and play and when you tell him it&#39;s time to leave he&#39;ll be screaming at the top of his lungs. There&#39;s no such thing having it easy when you have kids unless you don&#39;t give a shit about your own child.</p>\n\n<p>This dude has no idea what it takes to be a father, he probably only sees his child an hour a day and says OP is taking the child away from him? Meanwhile he contradicts himself by saying child needs his mother more. So glad you got out of that OP.</p>\n</div>",
