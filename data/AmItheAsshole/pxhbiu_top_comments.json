One common denominator with all of them was that they were let off from simple offences when they were teens.  Basically, because they never faced any consequences from bad behavior when they were young, they never learned that they shouldn't do stupid shit and their bad behavior continued into adulthood when the consequences we're far more severe.\n\nAs a minor, the girl will probably only get a slap on the wrist.  But it should be sufficient to help teach her to not break into other people's homes.\n\nYou should also take a copy of the police report and file for a restraining order to keep her from your home and brother.  This would send a clear message that she can't be anywhere near your brother.  \n\nOne way you know you're doing the right thing is because your brother is thankful.

That needs to be prosecuted.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had a few acquaintances and family members who ended up doing time in jail for different offences.  One common denominator with all of them was that they were let off from simple offences when they were teens.  Basically, because they never faced any consequences from bad behavior when they were young, they never learned that they shouldn&#39;t do stupid shit and their bad behavior continued into adulthood when the consequences we&#39;re far more severe.</p>\n\n<p>As a minor, the girl will probably only get a slap on the wrist.  But it should be sufficient to help teach her to not break into other people&#39;s homes.</p>\n\n<p>You should also take a copy of the police report and file for a restraining order to keep her from your home and brother.  This would send a clear message that she can&#39;t be anywhere near your brother.  </p>\n\n<p>One way you know you&#39;re doing the right thing is because your brother is thankful.  He may not be telling you all the ways his Ex has been reaching out and may not have the ability to determine what contact is inappropriate.  File for a restraining order.</p>\n</div>",

It doesn't matter if you think you know best; your brother has the first, last and every word in between on the subject of whether he wants a girlfriend.\n\nBut you already understand this concept. For instance, you think therapy would be good for your brother. And it's quite likely you're right. However, your brother said he isn't ready. So, you're respecting his decision, even if you're convinced that therapy would be good for him.\n\nThis girl also thinks she knows what's best for your brother. But, in contrast to you, she's overruling his right to make his own decisions for himself. I could see her giving him one final parting gift, or a gift in friendship in light of his (and your) recent loss. But she's going too far. This is stalker territory.\n\nAs she is a juvenile, and presumably with no priors, she'll likely get a light punishment. But, forgive me for adding this, but since both you and your brother are very young, I'd feel better if I made a few points.\n\nThat restraining order is no joke. As someone who has also taken out a restraining order (or \"injunction,\" as it's known in my state), I would suggest you advise your brother that it is ***not*** a gift of discretionary authority to be used to decide if and when she's allowed to approach him or speak to him. She will not be allowed near him, or to communicate with him, period. He doesn't get to decide to uphold it sometimes, then reserve the option to not uphold it, to allow her to talk to him for a few minutes, for instance. He has to uphold it all the time, or he could get in trouble himself.\n\nThis means, if she comes within 500 feet of him (or whatever the limit is in your state), she needs to leave immediately, once she realizes he's there. If not, he needs to call the police, then and there. He doesn't reserve the right to decide not to. He's obligated to. It doesn't matter if it's in a public area, or a fun place for kids to be. If he's there, she can't be. Period.\n\nAnd she will not be allowed to communicate with him in any way. Not over the phone, not texting, and not by having friends deliver a message to him. Directly or indirectly, she is not to have contact with him. If she violates this, he ***has*** to go to the police immediately.\n\nIn short, if he gets that restraining order, he is obligated to report any and all violations of that restraining order. He does not reserve the right to sometimes report and sometimes not. If he tries that, it will get both him and her into serious trouble.\n\nI've seen too many people try to treat their restraining orders like it's some kind of magical ability they have to control others. \"I can decide whether you're allowed to talk to me, or come to my house.\" That's ***not*** how it works.",

So, you&#39;re respecting his decision, even if you&#39;re convinced that therapy would be good for him.</p>\n\n<p>This girl also thinks she knows what&#39;s best for your brother. But, in contrast to you, she&#39;s overruling his right to make his own decisions for himself. I could see her giving him one final parting gift, or a gift in friendship in light of his (and your) recent loss. But she&#39;s going too far. This is stalker territory.</p>\n\n<p>As she is a juvenile, and presumably with no priors, she&#39;ll likely get a light punishment. But, forgive me for adding this, but since both you and your brother are very young, I&#39;d feel better if I made a few points.</p>\n\n<p>That restraining order is no joke. As someone who has also taken out a restraining order (or &quot;injunction,&quot; as it&#39;s known in my state), I would suggest you advise your brother that it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a gift of discretionary authority to be used to decide if and when she&#39;s allowed to approach him or speak to him. She will not be allowed near him, or to communicate with him, period. He doesn&#39;t get to decide to uphold it sometimes, then reserve the option to not uphold it, to allow her to talk to him for a few minutes, for instance. He has to uphold it all the time, or he could get in trouble himself.</p>\n\n<p>This means, if she comes within 500 feet of him (or whatever the limit is in your state), she needs to leave immediately, once she realizes he&#39;s there. If not, he needs to call the police, then and there. He doesn&#39;t reserve the right to decide not to. He&#39;s obligated to. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in a public area, or a fun place for kids to be. If he&#39;s there, she can&#39;t be. Period.</p>\n\n<p>And she will not be allowed to communicate with him in any way. Not over the phone, not texting, and not by having friends deliver a message to him. Directly or indirectly, she is not to have contact with him. If she violates this, he <strong><em>has</em></strong> to go to the police immediately.</p>\n\n<p>In short, if he gets that restraining order, he is obligated to report any and all violations of that restraining order. He does not reserve the right to sometimes report and sometimes not. If he tries that, it will get both him and her into serious trouble.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen too many people try to treat their restraining orders like it&#39;s some kind of magical ability they have to control others. &quot;I can decide whether you&#39;re allowed to talk to me, or come to my house.&quot; That&#39;s <strong><em>not</em></strong> how it works.</p>\n</div>",

Breaking and entering was crossing an unforgivable and extremely unhealthy line. Her actions of leaving gifts and letters at the door are understandable for a heartbroken teen. However, after failed repeated attempts, that should have been enough to realize it was time to move on. Obsessive behavior that leads to criminal acts regardless of intent is a sign of a much bigger problem. Most likely an untreated mental illness. If her behavior is not addressed the way it needs to be, it will only indulge and encourage this inappropriate and dangerous behavior as an adult. If she was eighteen, she would have gone to jail and had this added to a criminal record. If anything, in the long term, you are indirectly doing her a kindness by bringing this unhealthy mindset and behavior to light. It is her parents/caregiver's responsibility now to properly address and handle it accordingly. Just as it is now your responsibility to be your brother's caregiver. \n\nThe fact that she didn't take his well-being into account in the first place suggests an unhealthy attachment. He's a grieving teenage boy who just lost his parents and had his entire world turned on its head. Yet rather than take that into account, she was focused on herself only. That is not only unhealthy, but also dangerous. And the commenter that suggested if the rolls were reversed it would be an entirely different matter is correct. If this were a boy stalking an ex girlfriend who broke into her home trying to convince her to take him back? He would have absolutely faced criminal charges and have a ton of backlash. You are doing right by your brother and even though this is a difficult situation, you are responsible for your brother's health and safety. You did what any good parent should. As a mother myself, I commend you for your actions. Don't let other's dictate what you know to be right. You're awesome and I sincerely hope that girl's parents get her the help she needs.",

If anything, in the long term, you are indirectly doing her a kindness by bringing this unhealthy mindset and behavior to light. It is her parents/caregiver&#39;s responsibility now to properly address and handle it accordingly. Just as it is now your responsibility to be your brother&#39;s caregiver. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that she didn&#39;t take his well-being into account in the first place suggests an unhealthy attachment. He&#39;s a grieving teenage boy who just lost his parents and had his entire world turned on its head. Yet rather than take that into account, she was focused on herself only. That is not only unhealthy, but also dangerous. And the commenter that suggested if the rolls were reversed it would be an entirely different matter is correct. If this were a boy stalking an ex girlfriend who broke into her home trying to convince her to take him back? He would have absolutely faced criminal charges and have a ton of backlash. You are doing right by your brother and even though this is a difficult situation, you are responsible for your brother&#39;s health and safety. You did what any good parent should. As a mother myself, I commend you for your actions. Don&#39;t let other&#39;s dictate what you know to be right. You&#39;re awesome and I sincerely hope that girl&#39;s parents get her the help she needs.</p>\n</div>",

He's a great kid, but losing our parents made him a quiet, sad young boy. I've tried to encourage him to attend therapy so he can work on his grief, but he has refused every single time telling me that he's not ready yet. I get it, everyone works at their own peace and as longs as he's not deliberately hurting himself, I won't pressure him. I try to be as involve in his life as I can be without it being overwhelming, we both enjoy movie nights or binge watch shows on the weekends and he also helps my husband with his old car. \n\nBefore our parents passing my brother had a gf (16), she seemed like a good kid too, but after the funeral my brother decided that being in a relationship wasn't what he needed at that time and broke up with her. Totally valid. But she didn't take it good and was sure that my brother only needed ''some love'' to heal. \n\nLast month she began to drop letters and gifts to our door and my brother refused to open them every single time, she used to message and call him too and I could see the distress on my brother's face. The worst thing happened last friday, it was my brother's birthday and my husband and I decided to take him out, when we got back he went to his room and as soon as he did it, eh came down running. \n\nNow, his ex found her own way into my house, arranged his room with photos of him with her, their friends and our family, put some balloons and was waiting for him with a cake, mind you, this is creepy as fuck, so while my husband entertained her I called the police and they took her for trespassing private property. My brother is thankful, but my husband and the kid's parents are sure I'm overreacting and that I should drop the charges because she's trying to do something nice.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But she didn&#39;t take it good and was sure that my brother only needed &#39;&#39;some love&#39;&#39; to heal. </p>\n\n<p>Last month she began to drop letters and gifts to our door and my brother refused to open them every single time, she used to message and call him too and I could see the distress on my brother&#39;s face. The worst thing happened last friday, it was my brother&#39;s birthday and my husband and I decided to take him out, when we got back he went to his room and as soon as he did it, eh came down running. </p>\n\n<p>Now, his ex found her own way into my house, arranged his room with photos of him with her, their friends and our family, put some balloons and was waiting for him with a cake, mind you, this is creepy as fuck, so while my husband entertained her I called the police and they took her for trespassing private property. My brother is thankful, but my husband and the kid&#39;s parents are sure I&#39;m overreacting and that I should drop the charges because she&#39;s trying to do something nice.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

EVERYONE gets dumped, and allowing her to terrorize your brother just drags her antics out further. \n\nthere is no \"other point of view\" you would benefit from here. what your husband wants is for you to ENCOURAGE HER. if she knows she doesn't have to face consequences, it must mean that he still loves her, so she HAS to keep trying. she is not going to stop until she gets a reality check. \n\nshe BROKE INTO YOUR HOME. into your brothers bedroom. his parents just died, his whole life has been turned upside down, and she's upset she got dumped. boo fucking hoo. she is NOT the victim here.  your husband thinks you should let bygones be bygones, just forget about the whole thing? yeah, under NO circumstances should you do that. that's how you end up with your brother getting fucking kidnapped.\n\nask your husband if he has an ex he hates. then ask if he would feel creeped out or violated if she broke into your home, your bedroom, to set up a romantic candlelight dinner for the two of them, with photos of her face plastered around the room. even better, ask how he'd feel if one of *your* exes pulled the same thing. he'd probably not like it! if he says it wouldn't bother him and he wouldn't wanna press charges, he's fooling himself. he needs to learn to have some sympathy for your brother, NOT the fucking crazy girl who broke into his bedroom. \n\nyour husband needs a hard reality check. he doesn't seem to care for your brother very much, he seems like he just wants to sweep the whole thing under the rug and pretend things are normal. which is super easy for him, since he doesn't have a crazed stalker who again, broke. into. your home. she's not a poor upset girl who just didn't understand what she was doing, she ignored his wishes completely and committed a crime. she didn't just accidentally find her way into your house, this was a plan she's had for awhile. yknow. cause your brother was ignoring her. \n\nand she IS going to escalate if you don't file charges.\n\nedit: holy crap thanks for the awards!!! i just realized i didn't actually vote, lmao. OP, you are definitely NTA!! but your husband sure is!!! along with the girl's parents, because they raised a monster!!! \n\nalso, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put your brother in therapy. it doesn't matter that he hasn't asked about it, therapy isn't just for if you're struggling. therapy can also be preventative, instead of waiting until he feels bad enough that he decides to ask about it. you can make sure he has the tools to take care of himself, BEFORE it escalates into his mental health affecting his whole life. waitlists can be a couple months long, so if he does end up in a crisis it could be awhile before he gets a professional to help. honestly this one incident with his ex is probably enough to give someone PTSD, it's a good idea to get him into therapy before you find out.",

A significant amount of first time juvenile offenders end up being put on a pre-adjudicatoy supervision or a consent decree, that if successfully completed, never results in any formal adjudication, similar to a deferred adjudication or probation without verdict, like they often do with adult first time offenders. \n\nThe major difference (in many places but not everywhere, I don't know how they do it in every state) is that juveniles are not considered criminals, they are delinquent. Where an adult would be \"convicted of a crime\", a juvenile would be \"adjudicated delinquent\" if found to be 'guilty' (they don't call it that) so juveniles are not considered to be convicted of a crime.\n\nEven when a conviction does end up on someone's record, you can petition for expungement or a partial expungement. Juvenile records are often sealed and not available for public view anyway, law enforcement/probation/parole/court personnel/government agencies will still have access if needed but they aren't necessarily going to haunt them forever. Of course if you are adjudicated of a felony and you keep getting in trouble, that could count against your record even as an adult so you could end up in a higher sentencing bracket thanks to juvenile offenses if you keep getting in trouble.",

A significant amount of first time juvenile offenders end up being put on a pre-adjudicatoy supervision or a consent decree, that if successfully completed, never results in any formal adjudication, similar to a deferred adjudication or probation without verdict, like they often do with adult first time offenders. </p>\n\n<p>The major difference (in many places but not everywhere, I don&#39;t know how they do it in every state) is that juveniles are not considered criminals, they are delinquent. Where an adult would be &quot;convicted of a crime&quot;, a juvenile would be &quot;adjudicated delinquent&quot; if found to be &#39;guilty&#39; (they don&#39;t call it that) so juveniles are not considered to be convicted of a crime.</p>\n\n<p>Even when a conviction does end up on someone&#39;s record, you can petition for expungement or a partial expungement. Juvenile records are often sealed and not available for public view anyway, law enforcement/probation/parole/court personnel/government agencies will still have access if needed but they aren&#39;t necessarily going to haunt them forever. Of course if you are adjudicated of a felony and you keep getting in trouble, that could count against your record even as an adult so you could end up in a higher sentencing bracket thanks to juvenile offenses if you keep getting in trouble.</p>\n</div>",
