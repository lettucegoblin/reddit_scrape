This way you ensure that he understands why he gets a negative reception from his mates, for something that he shouldn&#39;t be ashamed about. To support him in exploring what he likes to wear I find it helpful to first try this kind of things in a protected environment, i.e. where the choice can be seen as fitting. I don&#39;t know about the U.S. but here in Germany we have the annual carnival which is a great time to try crossdressing in public for young boys as everyone is wearing costumes.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not assuming you did this on purpose, but the way you acted yould also be seen as a way to punish your son for his choice, as you deliberatedly let him face public shaming. Just something to think about.</p>\n</div>",

Why doesn't the bully pick on the star quarterback? The bully typically isn't going to target someone like that because they know it is no longer a situation sided in their favor. Plus the quarterback is not going to sit there and take it without defending themselves.\n\nUsually a bully is targeting someone because they know that person will not stand up for themselves. It is a \"safe\" choice. They can deal with their mental problems in an unhealthy manner without risk of being challenged. It is typically not \"personal\", usually it is based on opportunity.\n\nIn middle school this kid was just an absolute douche in general. But he decided to target me specifically.

Then he would randomly flip a switch in his mind and start bashing my head against the window or punching my arm.\n\nAfter about a month of that I snapped.
