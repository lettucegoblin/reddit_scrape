You really need a sit down conversation with your husband and MIL. </p>\n\n<p>Ask them both if they think going through other people\u2019s trash cans is reasonable behavior. Demand that they explain why and why not. </p>\n\n<p>Then ask if they think revealing personal and private medical information to the entire family that they came by while going through the trash is reasonable behavior. Really give them time to answer. </p>\n\n<p>Ask MIL how she would feel if you found vaginal cream and menopause diapers in her trash and proceeded to gossip about it to her relatives. </p>\n\n<p>Ask husband how he would feel if your mother had found his erectile dysfunction pills or skidmarked underwear and then told the whole family. </p>\n\n<p>Ask your husband if he really wants to find out through his mother that you are pregnant or if he would rather be the first to know and told by his wife? </p>\n\n<p>Then ask your MIL why she felt entitled to tell him before even confirming with you.</p>\n\n<p>So many questions. </p>\n\n<p>They really both don\u2019t want to really talk about \u201cthe bigger issue\u201d but instead of how you were wrong for \u201clying\u201d. Not considering WHY you had to do this in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I would definitely reconsider having children with a man who is clearly a child himself.</p>\n</div>",

I was on my period and changed my tampon. Since there were a lot of little kids (toddler/preschool age) in the house I wanted to make sure my used tampon was at the bottom of the trash can (I wrapped it in toilet paper, nobody freak out and think I was leaving a bloody tampon exposed). So when I put the tampon down to the bottom, the pregnancy test was in there and it was face up, and since I\u2019d had a couple positive pregnancy tests, I knew what the two lines meant. I didn\u2019t mean to see it and I never told anyone. I felt really bad that I had even seen it since it felt like an invasion of privacy. I cannot fathom a person thinking they have any business announcing another person\u2019s pregnancy!</p>\n</div>",
