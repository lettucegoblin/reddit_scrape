So, how does your nieces ability to enter your daughter's room when she's not there impact their ability to spend time with her? Not at all, that's how much. Your wife is an AH for trying to blame-shifting here. But then, blame-shifting and victim-blaming seem to run in the family, don't they? Because that's what your BIL did by declaring your daughter shouldn't have the make-up in the first place that his daughter ruined.\n* Regarding not having your wife's back, you're still doing the right thing. Because she should have her daughter's back, which you do. She's clearly in the wrong here. However, you need to have a serious talk with your wife. About how badly your BIL's and nieces' presence in your home impacts you, your daughter, and your relationship with your wife. I mean, her giving you and your daughter the silent treatment for protecting her(self) and her belongings is very high up there in the realms of unreasonalbe, if not toxic.\n* If your wife stays unreasonable and \"upset\" with you, I'd seriously suggest that you make sure your nieces know where your wife keeps her make-up, her jewellery, phone cases and whatever else they may be interested in. I'm pretty sure she'll sing a different tune pretty quickly. Especially if you make sure she can't use your common money (household money or the like), but only her personal spending money to replace the stuff your nieces steal/destroy.",

Your wife really ought to be ashamed of herself for not advocating for HER daughter instead of her brother's daughters.\n\nLet's get one thing straight. You both allowed 3 ADULTS  to move into your home. Your wife needs to understand that.  You say that other family members wouldn't help and so now you're stuck in a bad situation.  Did anyone ask your daughter how SHE would feel about this? Because clearly your wife, uncle and her cousins don't seem to care how she feels about her things being ruined and taken since they did.  Instead, they are willing dismiss the cousin's behavior because \"that's girl stuff\" or the makeup kit she saved for \"is too expensive and adult\" for her.  Well, apparently it wasn't too adult for his adult daughters to ruin.  In some places this is grounds for arrest too. Your daughter is a minor and they aren't.  And they are taking and destroying her things.\n\nI would have a come to Jesus conversation with your wife.  I would indicate that you know she wants to help her brother and his kids, but she is forgetting that her priority is her own daughter.  Her taking sides and defending them is damaging her relationship with her own child because she has been bearing the brunt of their bad behavior.  She is allowing 3 ADULTS to bully and demean HER CHILD because she is so invested in her need to help her brother. And, you need to work on a plan and a timeline as to when they all need to get out.  Unless things change drastically, they are GUESTS in your home and they should act like it. And you are perfectly within your rights to send them packing if they can't shape up.\n\nI am honestly appalled at your wife's behavior. She seems to think nothing of your daughter's feelings and disappointment and wants you to think of her cousins as YOUR daughters. Well, do that then. Make them buy a new kit for your daughter. Hold them accountable to their behavior and mete out discipline when warranted.  If they don't like it and don't comply, and keep wreaking havoc, get eviction papers ready for the girls and your BIL. Keep records of everything with dates and times in case you need it.  If anything else goes missing or other types of behavior like you've described occurs, see if you can press charges. And if you get them out of the house, change the locks.\n\nI don't know the circumstance that prevents your BIL from being able to at least find his own apartment for him and the daughters, but I strongly suggest this be made part of the conversation as well.  Moving in  cannot be the long-term and permanent solution for his issues. u/OnlyInQuebec9",

Her taking sides and defending them is damaging her relationship with her own child because she has been bearing the brunt of their bad behavior.  She is allowing 3 ADULTS to bully and demean HER CHILD because she is so invested in her need to help her brother. And, you need to work on a plan and a timeline as to when they all need to get out.  Unless things change drastically, they are GUESTS in your home and they should act like it. And you are perfectly within your rights to send them packing if they can&#39;t shape up.</p>\n\n<p>I am honestly appalled at your wife&#39;s behavior. She seems to think nothing of your daughter&#39;s feelings and disappointment and wants you to think of her cousins as YOUR daughters. Well, do that then. Make them buy a new kit for your daughter. Hold them accountable to their behavior and mete out discipline when warranted.  If they don&#39;t like it and don&#39;t comply, and keep wreaking havoc, get eviction papers ready for the girls and your BIL. Keep records of everything with dates and times in case you need it.  If anything else goes missing or other types of behavior like you&#39;ve described occurs, see if you can press charges. And if you get them out of the house, change the locks.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know the circumstance that prevents your BIL from being able to at least find his own apartment for him and the daughters, but I strongly suggest this be made part of the conversation as well.  Moving in  cannot be the long-term and permanent solution for his issues. <a href=\"/u/OnlyInQuebec9\">u/OnlyInQuebec9</a></p>\n</div>",

Zoey shouldn&#39;t be REQUIRED to &quot;spend time&quot; with her cousins, especially if they&#39;re taking her things; she deserves to have autonomy and control over her space and belongings. Maybe this is how your wife was with your brother or maybe this is how Sloan &amp; Olivia are, but Zoey is an only child and used to doing things the only child way. They can&#39;t force her to suddenly be like them.</p>\n</div>",
