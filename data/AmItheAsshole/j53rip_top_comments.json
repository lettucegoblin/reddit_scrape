You could literally be The Worst Person on Earth, and you still WNBTA in this.\n\n>She is clearly pissed off and disgusted with me for doing this to my own family.\n\nThis is the part in these cases that always has me rolling in the aisles. LOL! She is ticked off (Strike one!) at you (Strike two!) because you called her on STEALING YOUR WORK (And ***STEEEEE***\\-RIKE THREE! You're **OUT!!!**) from you?!?! And your own family tried to shame, guilt and blackmail you into letting her and your brother get away with it? Seriously??? That is some massive entitlement, self-centeredness, discrimination, favoritism, and just plain foolish stupidity on the part of your SIL, brother, parents, and anyone else who jumped on that bandwagon. The least of justice would be her losing her following, because she has proven herself of being untrustworthy. You did nothing to prove that; all you did was catch her and your brother at it and demand equitable restitution. If you'd taken it to court, you could have sued for and very likely received additional compensation for defamation, pain & suffering, and legal fees. Your parents are a piece of work for being upset with you for using the law as leverage to uphold your rights as a human being equivalent to your SIL; I cannot imagine what they are thinking... and quite frankly, I don't want to.\n\nSave your legal notes and talk to your pre-law friend about any statute of limitations for your case, because it wouldn't surprise me if this one goes extra innings, and you find out your family is either reneging, withholding the agreed-on compensation, or slandering/libeling you later. Be prepared to actually sue. Since you already made the decision to go NC, it's not like the choice would worsen those relationships. Good luck on any future writing!\n\nEdit: I really hope your family reads this and learns what AHs everyone thinks they are. It won't likely change their position; people who have already decided that being this negatively discriminatory & overbiased, favoring a proven, prosecutable thief over the victim they stole from are not usually capable of seeing how toxic they are.

You could literally be The Worst Person on Earth, and you still WNBTA in this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>She is clearly pissed off and disgusted with me for doing this to my own family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the part in these cases that always has me rolling in the aisles. LOL! She is ticked off (Strike one!) at you (Strike two!) because you called her on STEALING YOUR WORK (And <strong><em>STEEEEE</em></strong>-RIKE THREE! You&#39;re <strong>OUT!!!</strong>) from you?!?! And your own family tried to shame, guilt and blackmail you into letting her and your brother get away with it? Seriously??? That is some massive entitlement, self-centeredness, discrimination, favoritism, and just plain foolish stupidity on the part of your SIL, brother, parents, and anyone else who jumped on that bandwagon. The least of justice would be her losing her following, because she has proven herself of being untrustworthy. You did nothing to prove that; all you did was catch her and your brother at it and demand equitable restitution. If you&#39;d taken it to court, you could have sued for and very likely received additional compensation for defamation, pain &amp; suffering, and legal fees. Your parents are a piece of work for being upset with you for using the law as leverage to uphold your rights as a human being equivalent to your SIL; I cannot imagine what they are thinking... and quite frankly, I don&#39;t want to.</p>\n\n<p>Save your legal notes and talk to your pre-law friend about any statute of limitations for your case, because it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if this one goes extra innings, and you find out your family is either reneging, withholding the agreed-on compensation, or slandering/libeling you later. Be prepared to actually sue. Since you already made the decision to go NC, it&#39;s not like the choice would worsen those relationships. Good luck on any future writing!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I really hope your family reads this and learns what AHs everyone thinks they are. It won&#39;t likely change their position; people who have already decided that being this negatively discriminatory &amp; overbiased, favoring a proven, prosecutable thief over the victim they stole from are not usually capable of seeing how toxic they are. Still, it might give you some minor satisfaction. They&#39;ve earned your NC.</p>\n</div>",

But let walk you thru the list you made.  \n\n-have a thumb drive or usb drive isn\u2019t that big of a deal.  Especially if the SIL is a blogger she might have one handy with shit she needs for her blog.  Plus, many people just have usb drives now on key chains and what not.  You make it sound like usb drives are new and costs a fortune.  This is 2020.  People game on cellphones, consoles are portable, and etc.  lol.   \n\n-I\u2019m sure the sister mentioned she finished the novel many times.  As she would be happy to announce she had written a novel.  You try it and see where you get.  The SIL knowing it was worth something is again easy to figure out.  The SIL could have contested an editor with an outline of the story and mentioned their would be sequels.  The editor said it would be big to send the full manuscript over.  This is all very possible.  We live in an age where a video can make someone famous in a matter of seconds.  \n\n-the OP doesn\u2019t like her, but that doesn\u2019t mean she knows she would steal from her.  I mean get real ass.  Maybe the the sister went to the bathroom and left the SIL and brother alone with her parents.  You act like the OP should have followed the SIL everywhere.  In my family, there is a few SIL not liked. We don\u2019t follow them around the house when they visit.  \n\n-again you are taking something simple and trying to make it sound complicated. Jesus Christ.  How can you use a computer if this is your thought process.  \n\n-same as above and my first bullet point.  Downloading written documents can take mere seconds.  Try downloading a book on pdf and see how quick it is.  \n\n-self-publishing isn\u2019t hard and neither is selling a product if your fans or followers enjoy your content.  Again people sell products that might not tie directly into what they do. But the SIL is a blog WRITER.  So selling a book isn\u2019t to far from that.  But if she told fans or followers ahead of time that she was putting out a book, she could easily sell 7k worth.  We don\u2019t know what her blog is like or how popular it is.  I mean video game companies sell umbrellas and watches.  Neither have to do with gaming.  Btw, I have friends who self published books on amazon. Not hard. \n\n-caves over vague threats? Lol this is my favorite one.  Just because it shows how little you know.  You must read to many tabloids or celebrity lawsuits because sometimes just the threat of a lawsuit makes the person give.  Especially in this case where there is proof the SIL stole, published, and made money off someone else\u2019s product.  We don\u2019t know where this took place but the laws could be strict there.   You say incompetent lawyer but just looking at your reasoning shows how incompetent you are.  The lawyer did what was wanted, to get the book back without dragging it out.  A lot of cases settle out of court and quickly.  The SIL didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.  \n\nI think you need someone who writes how the real world works and let them explain things to you.  Then have someone show you what a USB drive is and how it works.  Maybe watch some videos.",

In my family, there is a few SIL not liked. We don\u2019t follow them around the house when they visit.  </p>\n\n<p>-again you are taking something simple and trying to make it sound complicated. Jesus Christ.  How can you use a computer if this is your thought process.  </p>\n\n<p>-same as above and my first bullet point.  Downloading written documents can take mere seconds.  Try downloading a book on pdf and see how quick it is.  </p>\n\n<p>-self-publishing isn\u2019t hard and neither is selling a product if your fans or followers enjoy your content.  Again people sell products that might not tie directly into what they do. But the SIL is a blog WRITER.  So selling a book isn\u2019t to far from that.  But if she told fans or followers ahead of time that she was putting out a book, she could easily sell 7k worth.  We don\u2019t know what her blog is like or how popular it is.  I mean video game companies sell umbrellas and watches.  Neither have to do with gaming.  Btw, I have friends who self published books on amazon. Not hard. </p>\n\n<p>-caves over vague threats? Lol this is my favorite one.  Just because it shows how little you know.  You must read to many tabloids or celebrity lawsuits because sometimes just the threat of a lawsuit makes the person give.  Especially in this case where there is proof the SIL stole, published, and made money off someone else\u2019s product.  We don\u2019t know where this took place but the laws could be strict there.   You say incompetent lawyer but just looking at your reasoning shows how incompetent you are.  The lawyer did what was wanted, to get the book back without dragging it out.  A lot of cases settle out of court and quickly.  The SIL didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.  </p>\n\n<p>I think you need someone who writes how the real world works and let them explain things to you.  Then have someone show you what a USB drive is and how it works.  Maybe watch some videos.</p>\n</div>",
