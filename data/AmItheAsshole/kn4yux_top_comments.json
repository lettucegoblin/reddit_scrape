        "body": "Hello, fellow sock lover here. One thing you might consider doing is visualizing your boyfriend carrying out your punishment. Picture him waiting for an opportunity to get to your dresser while you're out of the house. Once you're out of the way, he opens the drawer and sees the collection you've built up over the years that makes you and your patients happy. \n\nHe doesn't care that you selected each pair because you were charmed by it and it makes you happy, that you paid for them with your hard-earned money, or that they provide distraction and joy for people who are getting their blood drawn.

If the answer is no, and he claims to love you, please understand that he defines love differently from the way you do. Your definition of love precludes carrying out a malicious, premeditated act of destruction to force someone to bend to your will. That's not true of him. He's shown you that's not true of him. \n\nI mention this because he will argue, probably has already argued, that he loves you and you should value that more than socks. And it's true, genuine love is worth a lot more than socks. But I'm telling you that the \"love\" he's offering shouldn't be assigned a lot of weight. He loves you like some people love their cars, not like a person should love their partner.",

I think people on Reddit are quick to jump to conclusions and give wild advice based on minimal information...\n\nbut this is obviously not really about the socks is it?\n\nThere is indeed *something* wrong with the nature of how this came about. You had something you enjoyed but your partner hated. Ok, that happens a lot, even if it doesn't affect the partner directly, that's still a fairly common thing in a relationship.

That was nice, you didn't even have to do that, but you did.\nThen you happen to wear them by accident in front of his parents, but as luck would have it, it was no big deal! Cool!

That is sooooo much to unpack. This is indeed where we can accurately assume lots of things from one instance due to the absurdity and selfishness of the act itself. This is appalling that any adult would do this to another. \n\nI'm not gonna tell you to go home and dump him- you said you're evaluating the situation, GOOD. MINIMALLY though, there needs to be a discussion of, \"I've been reflecting on what you did, and it's brought to my attention much bigger issues than socks. Here's why.\" And you need to explain to him how this act was a violation of your trust, lack of concern for your feelings and things, lack of respect for you as a human being, you do indeed feel outright stolen from(because you were). That this was a controlling and selfish act and you fear that it's foreshadowing his true character and what's to come. If the tables were turned how would he feel about the situation? About you if you did something like that to his things? What else does he not like of yours? Are any of your things safe around him? Are YOU safe around him? He did something over the top to deal with something that inconvenienced and affected his life not one bit- how will he handle other, bigger, REAL issues? \n\nI will say this, if you have such a discussion and he continues to be dismissive and claim you're overreacting- run. Get out. Because it's just proof that he is indeed all of the things I stated above. He is a poor partner and has too much growing up to be in a relationship.\n I am also someone who recognizes that people are capable of growth- if after such a discussion he seems to note your concerns and tries to make what he did right, then there might be potential for you two to keep growing together. And if that's the case, consider having him replace a portion of the *exact* ones. Maybe 10 or so that were special or made you extra happy, and then accept other fun ones that might not have been exactly what you had before for the rest. You'll get some new, fun patterns to show off, and it'll show that you're willing to be flexible and  work with him IF he's willing to work on himself.\n\nBest of luck to you, you do right by you.",

Then it turned into pouting and the silent treatment when I didn&#39;t wear g-strings. Even when I was working 350kms away, I still felt obliged to wear them every day. It took 9 years for him to tell me it was a fetish for him and he was so angry that I didn&#39;t know. </p>\n\n<p>When he told me he would bash my fucking face in if I didn&#39;t answer his questions during a (very regular) interrogation, I switched to underwear that were comfortable for me. That was 2 years ago and I STILL second guess myself when I put on my super comfortable bamboo mid rise underwear. </p>\n\n<p>Looking back there was a shitload of coercive sexual abuse, and controlling my underwear choice was the daily expression of that. </p>\n\n<p>OP this doesn&#39;t get better.
