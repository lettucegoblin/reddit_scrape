Just because someone is older doesn't mean you have to be respectful while they treat you like crap. \n\nYou should have kept your cool and not swore at her, you could have been the bigger person here, but clearly what you were saying wasn't working and she felt entitled to speak to you like crap because you're young. I'd have been pissed too.\n\nShe was in the wrong here, she's bringing up spoilt kids that think they can take other people's belongings.\n\nBut maybe next time an encounter like this happens you can learn to be firm and get your point across without raising your voice and swearing. Its a good skill to learn because life is full of AH's and it's always better to be the bigger person that stands up for themselves without sinking to the other person's level.",

Well anyways, I wasn\u2019t using my goggles so I just put them on the sideline instead of having to get out and give them to my mom for safe keeping and then have to get back in the water. I go on with my swimming when I randomly see a younger girl maybe like 9/10 emerge from under the water wearing my googles. (She did not have goggles to even *confuse* mine with hers). Now, I grew up with a dad that made it clear if something isn\u2019t yours, you don\u2019t touch that shit. You look with your eyes, not your hands. \n\nOff topic but relevant, when I was about 9 my younger cousin who was about 3 took something from my room and my mom said I should just let her keep it since she\u2019s crying over having to give it back. My dad saw how much it upset me because I expressed that she took it without asking and I didn\u2019t want her to keep it so he snatched it out of her hand(which caused her to cry even more) and gave it back to me and told my aunt (the mom of said cousin, who\u2019s my mom\u2019s sister) \u201cI don\u2019t go to your house and take things.\u201d And when they left my mom told my dad he should have just let her have it(funny, considering it was mine so shouldn\u2019t I be the one to dictate that). He said it was disgusting behavior to reward a child simply because they\u2019re crying. She knew it wasn\u2019t hers to keep and had to give it back. \n\nBack to the story\n\nSo, I asked my sister if she\u2019s seeing what I\u2019m seeing and if she told the girl she could use our goggles and she was like no, she never came up to me. So now I\u2019m like ok I didn\u2019t give her permission and neither did my sister. So I confronted her and she was like oh I found them over there. \u2026.so you just randomly took them and put them on? Instead of thinking it belonged to the other people using the pool. Not to mention her parents didn\u2019t even correct her like honey those aren\u2019t yours. \n\nI thought my mom would be proud of me for sticking up for myself. Nope, she said I should have just let her use them since after all I wasn\u2019t using them at the time. I was like but she didn\u2019t even ask. She just took them and put them on. \n\nAt 14 years old I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself. The way I would have been petty and just started to use their bike until they realized oh ok I don\u2019t want him using our bike and I would be like \u201cohh, now you know what it feels like?\u201d \n\nForget your mom, you had every right to speak up to a woman who didn\u2019t have her kids in check.
