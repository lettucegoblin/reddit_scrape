That trains kids to feel they must blindly obey authority figures and can\u2019t speak up for themselves. Yes, as my mother often reminds me, it may make her harder to \u201ccontrol.\u201d But do you want to raise a woman people can control?\n\nParents forget that they are their child\u2019s first exposure to someone who holds power or rank over them. If you give her the confidence and empowerment to stand up to you, she\u2019ll find it easier to stand up to anyone. \n\n* Also, IMO White knighting is sending the message \u201cI\u2019m overstepping cuz making you look weak makes me look strong.\u201d The message you sent your sitter was \u201cI\u2019m stepping in because I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d That\u2019s the difference.\n\nEDIT: 2 grammatical mistakes.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My odd advice to raise your daughter to stand up for herself: let her talk back to you. Avoid saying things like \u201cBecause I/we/they said so,\u201d especially without explaining why you want her to do something. That trains kids to feel they must blindly obey authority figures and can\u2019t speak up for themselves. Yes, as my mother often reminds me, it may make her harder to \u201ccontrol.\u201d But do you want to raise a woman people can control?</p>\n\n<p>Parents forget that they are their child\u2019s first exposure to someone who holds power or rank over them. If you give her the confidence and empowerment to stand up to you, she\u2019ll find it easier to stand up to anyone. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Also, IMO White knighting is sending the message \u201cI\u2019m overstepping cuz making you look weak makes me look strong.\u201d The message you sent your sitter was \u201cI\u2019m stepping in because I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d That\u2019s the difference.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: 2 grammatical mistakes.

Both parents worked full days so I was home alone with him. He was friendly enough but started going extra. He would hover when I made lunch and ask about it. I didn't like it but whatever. I mentioned it to my sister who was married right out of high school and pregnant and due soon. She made an effort to hang out when she could. He latched on to her immediately. He stayed after he was done for the day, waiting for her to come by, made comments about being there for the birth etc. It was awful. We were only told by our dad to be nice and he's a harmless old man etc. My sister finally snapped and told him to back off. Our father was horrified and still to this day brings up how embarrassed he is that she was rude to that guy.\n\nIt took us both years to learn to stand up for ourselves. You did something for that babysitter and hopefully that was a lesson she learned. You can tell an adult to mind their business and be rude about it if they are making you uncomfortable. If they really didn't mean to, they will stop. Good on ya!",

Everyone else will follow your lead. If you are self-confident and give off those vibes, master manipulators won't even attempt to mess with you. On the other hand if you are self-conscious and emote the need for acceptance, they will pick up on it immediately. \n\nNo one else can take care of you like you can. No one else can love you like you can love you. Self-love is the most important love of all and will set you up to be able to show honest and healthy love towards others without giving too much or becoming codependent. \n\nOnly you can determine your worth and anyone else's maltreatment of you is no reflection upon your worth as a son, daughter, sibling, friend, significant other, human, etc. It is a direct reflection of the pain and darkness inside them they have chosen not to heal. Perhaps they don't know it's possible. Either way, there's absolutely no excuse for their behavior but we need to become accountable for not putting ourselves in vulnerable positions, as adults, by having healthy boundaries and self-love. \n\nThe ONLY thing you can control about other people and what they do or say is how you choose to react to them. Spend time thinking about how you react and try to undo some of the unhealthy behaviors you've learned that really do no one any good. Don't waste energy overreacting to things and people you have absolutely no control over. Sometimes the wisest reaction is no reaction at all.\n\nExpectations of other people are resentments in the making. Learn to manage your expectations of other people and develop high expectations of yourself.  We are all products of our environment and our experiences and someone else is whole other person with a whole other brain, and so when there is a disagreement, there may not be a right and a wrong but \"their perspective\" and \"your perspective.\" If you want someone to respect your perspective, first respect theirs. Be the example. \n\nYou are 50% of an argument. Take accountability for that 50% and try to think about what you could have done differently to de-escalate to resolve the issue. Agreeing to disagree, compromising, putting it on a shelf for later, or letting it go are all options. \n\nUnderstand and learn that your emotions are your responsibility and that you are capable of changing how you feel about something just by changing how you choose to perceive it.

The only blending I've ever done is on my eyeshadow.\n\nI found it pretty funny. My almost 60 year old, (at the time this discussion took place), father cared more about what other people thought than I ever did. My late husband loved how I dressed. My teen daughters loved my closet but he & I were sitting in his car talking in a parking lot & he asked me if I thought I embarrassed my children with my clothes. I replied honestly. \"I probably do embarrass them in all kinds of ways just as you embarrassed me when you'd purposely try make me laugh while I was on stage for a school program but the fact they try raid my closet every morning before school & they jump at the chance to put my outfits together for me tells me they aren't that pressed about my clothes. Are you?\"\n\nSome people never outgrow the idea that they are supposed to cater to the opinions of others & some people outgrow it obscenely early like I happened to. Most people outgrow it in their early 30s. Idk I'd imagine it's exhausting.",

Picture someone who walked off a fashion magazine spread &amp; stepped into a fucking LLBean ad in my small town of 2700. I enjoy color &amp; texture. Everything around me is freaking beige. People ask where I got something all the time so, if I had to guess, I&#39;d guess most of my town is stuck in the idea of blending in. The only blending I&#39;ve ever done is on my eyeshadow.</p>\n\n<p>I found it pretty funny. My almost 60 year old, (at the time this discussion took place), father cared more about what other people thought than I ever did. My late husband loved how I dressed. My teen daughters loved my closet but he &amp; I were sitting in his car talking in a parking lot &amp; he asked me if I thought I embarrassed my children with my clothes. I replied honestly. &quot;I probably do embarrass them in all kinds of ways just as you embarrassed me when you&#39;d purposely try make me laugh while I was on stage for a school program but the fact they try raid my closet every morning before school &amp; they jump at the chance to put my outfits together for me tells me they aren&#39;t that pressed about my clothes. Are you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Some people never outgrow the idea that they are supposed to cater to the opinions of others &amp; some people outgrow it obscenely early like I happened to. Most people outgrow it in their early 30s. Idk I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s exhausting.</p>\n</div>",
