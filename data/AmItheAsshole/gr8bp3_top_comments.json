I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did.

        "body": "My family owns a Scrapyard/Junkyard also called dismantling yard. We are in Southern California we tow for the CHP and Sheriff's. However, I believe it standard protocol no matter where your at, when we acquire a vehicle wheather it be from a police tow with subsequent lien sale, purchasing a vehicle, or \"taking it off your GFs hands\" there needs to be a transfer of title so that the vehicle can be legally acquisitioned before it is either sold or destroyed. Considering you had an American classic I highly doubt a single part of that car was destroyed. Those guys know its value otherwise they're fucking morons. \n\nSo I see a couple potential scenarios in my head that could have happened with your vehicle and those douchebags who picked it up. No matter the scenario you need to have your lawyer contact the yard via legal documents. Like I said I couldn't imagine them destroying it. Even if they did the act of destroying it without proper paperwork, title, and acquisition numbers makes the act illegal which they know better. If they claimed to destroying it sue up the ass look up local dismantling laws and regulations. Otherwise good chance your car is being parked in some lot accumulating enough \"fees\" so the company can lien sale the vehicle at which point after about 30-120 days depending on estimated value they can assume legal possession if the vehicle. Only after they legally assume possession of the vehicle can it either be rebuilt, sold, parted out, or destroyed.\n\nDepending on what the company did with the vehicle should very well determine in my opinion the punitive damages you should go after. If they have the vehicle and all its parts I would seek minor damages for the hassle of retrieving back your stolen property. They were probably simply picking it up and going thru the legal channels to acquire the vehicle. If they parted out some or most the car go for max damages, they knowingly sold property that did not belong to them. If the vehicle was sold down the line or destroyed again shoot for maximum damages, or the whole farm, as they are sooooo shady they give the rest of automotive dismantlers a bad name. Good chances are they into other illegal shit besides.\n\nI hope that info helps. As far as your GF all I can say is find a new one who appreciates good ole Americana. The rest is entirely your discretion but I hope I gave you some clarity behind the thought processes of the idiots' who picked up the vehicle. On the bright side, you could most likely come out of this shit situation and age of social distancing with a cherried Impala.",
