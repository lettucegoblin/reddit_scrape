The fact that hour mom allows & worse - encourages it - is equally nauseating.\n\nYour mom, sister & BIL are not just massive AHs - they\u2019re also child abusers. You don\u2019t treat ANYONE - especially a minor child - as your personal slave.\n\nYou are a person - a whole human being all on your own. You have a life. You have things to do & people to see. You have wants & needs independent of others. You do not stop existing as a human because your sister is visiting. Her wish to dump her kids on someone so she can chat with your mom does not override whatever you have going on in your life. Your mom\u2019s wish to chat with her older daughter without the distraction of children does not override whatever you have going on in your life.\n\nIf they viewed you as an actual human being, they would ASK you \u201cwill you watch my children?\u201d & they would ACCEPT whatever answer they are given. But they don\u2019t view you as an actual human - who should be treated with the same dignity that they expect to be treated with.

In this case, it\u2019s watching your sister\u2019s children while she & your mom chat, etc.\n\nYour dad is only slightly better. He obviously knows that they\u2019re abusing you & does nothing to put a stop to it. So I can\u2019t give him too much credit for saying he would have gone along with your ruse.\n\nNot only are you NTA. You\u2019re a saint as far as I\u2019m concerned.
