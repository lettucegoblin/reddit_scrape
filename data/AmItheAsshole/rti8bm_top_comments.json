I guarantee you they have their wallets because they need their ideas at minimum if they're going to be drinking, also maybe for one person to go out without a wallet is understandable but for the entire family to go out and no one has a wallet????yeah right!\n\nBefore breaking up with him I would entertain myself first by telling him if we're going to get married there's going to be a prenup, I would say that no matter how long we've been married if we ever divorce for whatever reason he can never have anything I already had, I would also put it that he can never get alimony for what we got during marriage, and I would say that all bank accounts will always be separate. I think you said something about him not having a job? I would say he also has to get a job before you get married. Do this in a public setting just in case he gets violent (I've seen posts where the gold digger gets violent and it has been a man who was the gold digger), and then see how he reacts to all of this information. He's already showed you that you deserve better, but there's nothing like sprinkles on top of the whipped cream to give some more proof of what he's really like.\n\nYou deserve better, dump and block him. Make sure you have everything in order, he can't damage any of your belongings he may have, change locks if he has a key, in general get security cameras with night vision and audio for your own protection and if anyone asks why you broke up tell them the truth, he didn't love you, just your money.\nGood Luck and Please keep us updated!!!

We do not live together because we're waiting til marriage given he and his family are highly conservative Christians but they're really nice and loveable people.\n\n\n\nI had plans to spend NYE with Sam but he said he was out for NYE dinner celebration with his parents then called me again inviting me to join them and I happily did.\n\nHis parents were there, <they welcomed me and ordered many dishes and desserts and drinks. We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay.\n\nI pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that we'll split the check between us. Sam mumbled \"no you don't have to, we invited you\" but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me; I asked what was wrong and both MIL & FIL said they didn't have money on them. I was shocked I turned to Sam and he said he too forgot his wallet at home and didn't bring enough money to cover even on round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously \"aright so guess we should let the doctor pay!!\" I was taken a back I said I'm sorry but no this is just so much money to spend on one dinner by myself and I didn't think I was expected to pay the entire bill. Sam said I should pay and he'd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said I'm sorry but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation by him and family where I'm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expectbothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner. I told them I'll only pay for what I had and that's it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting as if they were strangers not family but that doesn't mean I'm obligated to pay, how could someone go out to a fancy restuarant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money?. Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out.\n\n\nSam called later at 2am basically yelling that I ruined NYE celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill amd instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay even if I have a good salary doesn't mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didn't reply he just said he'll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them.\n\nI felt awful thinking I should've covered the bill instead of leaving.
