The general guideline of married people is don't interact with them in that way. If they're flirting with you, ignore ignore ignore.

She's probably going to get more confrontational now (and I don't think that's what you wanted).**\n\nAs for her husband laughing at your comment, she needs to leave his ass. Any guy who cared about their marriage would not entertain that kind of comment. He obviously doesn't respect their marriage. I'm sure the wife already knows it since she's going crazy at every random neighbor that runs by. He's probably already cheated multiple times and that's why she seems off her rocker. Maybe they have kids and that's why she hasn't left him. She's probably trying to control everything because she feels very out of control.

That IS a problem with the husband and she shouldn\u2019t stay with him if he\u2019s actually looking at other woman. It means he hasn\u2019t settled with her and he still wants more despite them being married. Sounds like a shitty relationship and he shouldn\u2019t have gotten married to her in the first place if he wasn\u2019t happy\n\nOf course there is a chance she\u2019s just speculating that he checks out other women, and in that case that\u2019s just her being insecure. But as her partner, HE\u2019S the one who should be there for her and be reassuring.\n\nEDIT: people seem to be misinterpreting what I meant when I said \u201clook\u201d. By \u201clook\u201d I don\u2019t mean literally just glancing or noticing, I mean like staring or obviously checking someone out. It\u2019s like that one meme with the dude walking with his gf and he\u2019s checking out some other chick. I see that specific behavior as pretty disrespectful to the partner you are currently with. Of course I realize you can\u2019t just stop being attracted to people, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to lust after other people",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If my husband was legitimately checking out other woman I\u2019d probably feel kinda insecure. That IS a problem with the husband and she shouldn\u2019t stay with him if he\u2019s actually looking at other woman. It means he hasn\u2019t settled with her and he still wants more despite them being married. Sounds like a shitty relationship and he shouldn\u2019t have gotten married to her in the first place if he wasn\u2019t happy</p>\n\n<p>Of course there is a chance she\u2019s just speculating that he checks out other women, and in that case that\u2019s just her being insecure. But as her partner, HE\u2019S the one who should be there for her and be reassuring.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: people seem to be misinterpreting what I meant when I said \u201clook\u201d. By \u201clook\u201d I don\u2019t mean literally just glancing or noticing, I mean like staring or obviously checking someone out. It\u2019s like that one meme with the dude walking with his gf and he\u2019s checking out some other chick. I see that specific behavior as pretty disrespectful to the partner you are currently with.

Fucking bye.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If the OW is my friend the same thought process applies. </p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re a random that knew and didn&#39;t care, they just make the &quot;people I have no desire to know because they obviously suck&quot; list.</p>\n\n<p>If they had no idea I just feel kinship with them, because they thought they had a relationship too and now both of us are fucked.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I have had to deal with both scenarios. Never one where my SO cheated with a friend though, thank fuck.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t get seeing the OW as THE villain in any circumstance. Sirens and succubi don&#39;t exist and your SO is always at least equally complicit as the OW and is 100% to blame if the OW thought she was the only woman. </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t look down at someone who lashes out at the OW who knew SO had an SO, I just think its pointless. I don&#39;t believe in closure. </p>\n\n<p>If you go at someone who had no idea your SO was cheating, I think you&#39;re at least a bit dumb and probably too emotional to be confronting anyone at all as you&#39;re, hopefully, not thinking straight.</p>\n</div>",
