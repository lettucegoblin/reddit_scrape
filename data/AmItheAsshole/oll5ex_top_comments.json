It was my first time being a bridesmaid, too. \nI had even told her that my bf was excited and she met him and we all went out and drank. </p>\n\n<p>I slowly find out that I have no plus 1. I talk with my other friends and they explain the invitations, and if it\u2019s just your name there is no plus one. </p>\n\n<p>Then I continue to ask around and all other bridesmaids were allow to bring a plus one. \nMy friend was even asking about a bridesmaids cousin, because she didn\u2019t have her number, if she was seeing anyone. </p>\n\n<p>The bride was supposed to be my best friend. \nMy bf had a drinking issue, so I can understand in a way why maybe I wouldn\u2019t be bringing him but tell me the truth, I can handle it. When I approached her on the subject, she lied and said it was only serious couples ( remember the others bridesmaids cousin? Who\u2019s number she didn\u2019t have, and was asking if she was seeing anyone ?) so blatant lie. \nWe ended up getting into a huge fight.. not because I couldn\u2019t bring him but because of the lies and deception about the whole thing. \nI went to the wedding, and wrote off the friendship after that. I threw the whole friendship away because of the betrayal I felt and how stupid she made me look to all my other friends. </p>\n\n<p>So NTA. Your preaching to the choir- and I know exactly what you felt. I\u2019m sorry\nYou went through that, and at the very best you deserved honesty and that\u2019s what hurts the most. You would think the BRIDESMAIDS would all get a plus one, right ??</p>\n</div>",

Call it out.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf that is the case why was this option not brought up when I asked in person why I could not bring <em>BF</em>? If you expected him why did you not inquire as to why he did not RSVP? Why didn\u2019t you ask me what his meal choice was? You know very well you went out of your way to make sure he did not attend the reception with me and your scrambling to come up with excuses at this point is incredibly weak.</p>\n\n<p>Even with all of that I would have, and planned to, let it go if <em>groom\u2019s</em> friends (Dean, snickerers, person that brought you to the table) hadn\u2019t planned out a scheme to humiliate me in front of their entire table as a way of forcing me into accepting a date with a drunk and exceptionally creepy Dean. Even as I tried to politely walk away he continued shouting pickup lines at me until I\u2019d had enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s names, but be sure to call them out specifically for their compliance.</p>\n</div>",

Looking really smug and a few other people are standing there who are already giggling so I already start feeling angry. Because again this is reminding me of the second grade lunchroom scenario and I'm already imagining how it's going to go. \n\nHe actually started out with \"Hey beautiful\" and I went \"what do you want\" in an angry tone. \n\nI think he sensed that this wasn't going to go like what he had in his mind but he continued what he obviously planned out. So he said \"I just wanted to ask you something\" and I said \"WHAT\"\n\nHe went \"There is something wrong with my phone can you help me fix it?\" I said \"I don't know anything about phones sorry I can't help you\" and turned around to go back.\n\nAnd he went \"No no, what's wrong with my phone is that it doesn't have your number in it.\"\n\nAnd I just went off. Because I already made it clear I was not into whatever this was, and I already turned to leave. But he interrupted me leaving and kept going despite it all. I was furious becauses I was already angry plus he wasn't paying attention to how I felt or caring about it. So I felt like he deserved what I was going to give to him.\n\nI raised my voice and said: \"DEAN. FUCK OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE. No, you can't have my fucking number. No, I don't want to go out with you. I don't want to talk to you. I'm not attracted to you. I don't want anything to do with you. YOU ARE NOT INTERESTING OR ATTRACTIVE TO ME AT ALL. I want you to leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\nHe was looking down during all of this and not at me and I said \"I want you to look at me and agree you're going to leave me alone from now on YES OR NO.\" And he said yes, and I said \"LOOK AT ME AND SAY YES\" so he did. so I turned around and left him alone after that. \n\nI know I humiliated him and I did it on purpose, I hate to admit that but it's true. \n\nEven though I raised my voice it was loud in the room so only the people standing nearby and one unrelated table nearby heard it.",

Something like this happened to me in high school - so similar that while it's obviously not identical, it makes it super clear to me that yeah, they were all (the ones there anyway) in on it. For me it was them trying to set me up with a guy who needed a date to prom and I wanted no part of it, so they just - kept trying to engineer public settings where I'd be on the spot.\n\nThey were so pissed and confused because when they did the whole 'come here, someone has something to ask you' which led to him literally KNEELING on one knee in the cafeteria, I walked away shaking my head (because I'd already turned him down before). Apparently the chubby metalhead chick isn't supposed to be not-that-desperate! (I barely knew him, we weren't in the same year, and I wasn't into the whole prom thing anyway, so ... yeah, I don't know.)\n\nPoint is, if it was already cringe and desperate in high school, and obvious group manipulation then, it's not less so at a wedding. You may have wanted to humiliate him, but at the same time, you were sending a message both to him AND to the people involved in the obvious scheme to knock it the fuck off.",

Something like this happened to me in high school - so similar that while it&#39;s obviously not identical, it makes it super clear to me that yeah, they were all (the ones there anyway) in on it. For me it was them trying to set me up with a guy who needed a date to prom and I wanted no part of it, so they just - kept trying to engineer public settings where I&#39;d be on the spot.</p>\n\n<p>They were so pissed and confused because when they did the whole &#39;come here, someone has something to ask you&#39; which led to him literally KNEELING on one knee in the cafeteria, I walked away shaking my head (because I&#39;d already turned him down before). Apparently the chubby metalhead chick isn&#39;t supposed to be not-that-desperate! (I barely knew him, we weren&#39;t in the same year, and I wasn&#39;t into the whole prom thing anyway, so ... yeah, I don&#39;t know.)</p>\n\n<p>Point is, if it was already cringe and desperate in high school, and obvious group manipulation then, it&#39;s not less so at a wedding.

And everyone in on it did too. They used your fear of destroying social graces go exclude your bf, get you near dean without your bf present but with others socially pressuring you into playing nice, and to make you feel awkward for rebuffing him and force you into maintaining some polite veneer for their comfort and entertainment. That is fucked up, not cute. They were trying to rely on social coercion - the only flaw in your delivery is that they ALL deserved that dressing down. Their behavior was disgustingly disrespectful to YOU asan individual, and not behavior that should be tolerated from friends. They clearly don\u2019t care about your feelings or wants, they are condescending in treating your relationship choices as invalid and up for being altered by outsiders, just WILDLY disrespectful.</p>\n</div>",
