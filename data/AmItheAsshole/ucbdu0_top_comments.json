If he wanted to go behind your back and volunteer to host, he should\u2019ve been a good host and cooked. You\u2019re a new parent, it\u2019s expected for you to be overwhelmed and exhausted. No one should be expecting a full course meal from you, and especially when you didn\u2019t even have time to plan. You\u2019re husband owes you a massive apology. The fact that he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s been slighted would make me livid if I were in your shoes. He stabbed you in the back then threw a tantrum you didn\u2019t make the impossible happen. You\u2019re a saint for not telling him to go get out.</p>\n</div>",
