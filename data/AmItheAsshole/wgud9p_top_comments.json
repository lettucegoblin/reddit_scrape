YOU (and not both of you) are paying for the wedding\n  So him and his mom can make decisions but YOU have no say? Yes, it&#39;s his wedding also but you were trying to accommodate BOTH families (whereas he only cares about himself and his). Why are you the only one paying for the wedding-after all, it&#39;s HIS wedding also. Please seriously rethink this! Look at past behaviors (how big a presence his mom is in his life, how other decisions the two of you had been decided, how he treats people when he doesn&#39;t get his way, etc)</p>\n</div>",

This man and his mommy are refusing to accommodate the bride&#39;s whole family <em>and</em> the bride herself. And they aren&#39;t even paying for it!</p>\n</div>",
