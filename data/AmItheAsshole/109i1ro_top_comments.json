        "body": "Absolutely NTA \n\nHoney. I want to just hug you. You are BEYOND ok to step outside and get a breath of fresh air when needed. If your babies are in a safe place (I\u2019m a crib, on a floor mat, etc\u2026) it is more than ok to set them down and let them cry for a few min while you gather yourself. Or get some food. Or water. Or scroll Reddit for 5 min for cute puppy pictures. Or cry yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re doing wonderful as a mom. In fact, you\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nOur pediatrician encouraged me to set baby down and walk away sometimes if I was getting stressed or emotional. My OB encouraged me to do the same. You SHOULD put your babies down and walk away so you don\u2019t get too upset. It\u2019s HARD. Newborns and infants are so hard. You have to take care of your needs also.\n\nEvery parenting resource ever says it\u2019s ok to put your baby down and walk away. Every other experienced parent you meet has put their baby down and walked away. \n\nIf you were walking down the street, leaving your property, sleeping, etc. It would be different. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re right outside your door for goodness sakes - does tour husband think you need to physically have your eyes on the babies 24/7? Do you never leave the room to pee alone? You\u2019re no further from them in the bathroom than you are outside the front door. \n\nYour husband needs some sense knocked into him. It\u2019s is absolutely not sustainable for you to be home alone 24/7 with infant triplets and no help. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s often not sustainable for moms to be home alone 24/7 with ONE infant without help. Honestly, this scenario isn\u2019t very safe for you or your babies either. \n\nIf your husband is so offended by the idea that you need 2 minutes alone, he needs to find someone to help you. His mom can come help one day a week so you can go for a walk and get a nap. He can hire a nanny to help in the afternoons. He can take over on his day off while you leave and go get some fresh air at a park (or\u2026nap lol) \n\nI really wish you the best and I hope you are able to sit your husband down and have a real come to Jesus talk with him about how things are going. You\u2019re not magic. You can\u2019t do this all on your own without help. \n\nAnd hell, you might be kicking absolute ass! Maybe you ARE the best mom on earth and parenting like an absolute PRO. But it would STILL be ok for you to set babies down and walk away when needed.\n\nYou got this! You\u2019re doing amazing!\n\nEdit to add the most infuriating part: your in laws need to STFU. Your husband is an AH for even going to them about this. This is a marriage/parenting issue. It\u2019s to be worked out between the two of you. Their opinions don\u2019t count. They don\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t get a say. \n\nAnd the fact your in laws are even taking this stance much less being mad at you about it and hounding you, is astonishing. I\u2019d be livid. It sounds like some boundaries around their involvement in your life are needed. \n\nI tried not to comment on your ages, because I don\u2019t want to come off as a crotchety old lady (im in my 30s and have a toddler) but the more I think about it, it is relavent here. \n\nYou are so young. So so young. Your husband too, but 20 is so so young, immature, naive\u2026. Not in a bad way. You just don\u2019t have the life experiences yet. And it makes it really hard to set boundaries and to stand up for yourself. It can be hard to be confident in yourself and be firm with expecting your needs to be met when you\u2019re that young. Add three babies in the mix? Motherhood makes us doubt ourselves so so much. As moms, we are so unfair to ourselves! \n\nBut from an outside perspective OP, this post makes it clear to me you\u2019re doing amazing. You\u2019re a badass of a young woman already. There\u2019s no way I could have done what you\u2019re doing at 20 years old. If you can find ways to build your confidence in yourself i think it would help with setting boundaries and not allowing people to treat your poorly. Your husband should be COMMUNICATING with you if he\u2019s uncomfortable with a parenting choice. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong of him to be uncomfortable in the moment, but he should NOT be yelling at you and involving family members. \n\nIn a loving and supportive partnership, if he came home to his wife sitting outside the front door with the baby monitor just trying to get some fresh air while the babies cry 15 feet away inside\u2026\u2026 His first instinct should be \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? Are you ok? How can I help? Give me the monitor, I\u2019ve got the babies, go for a walk. We\u2019ll talk through this later\u201d \n\nOk I\u2019m going to stop ranting now. I just feel for you OP.

That said - try not to make those breathers too long while babies are so upset, but it sounds like you're just taking a second to breathe and calm down. \n\nDad shouldn't be saying anything but positive things about you to his family. In general, unless there is an active way they can help with something, there's not good that will come from complaining about your spouse to your family, as that will stick in their minds moving forward. If he just needed to complain about being frustrated, which is fair, he needs to go to a trusted friend. I hope you can talk to him about how much his family means to you and that him sharing complaints with his parents causes a rift in your relationship. The only reason I could imagine him mentioning this and it being positive would be for him to say, \"Hey fam, OP is getting really overwhelmed during the day. Totally understandable since there are three babies crying! It helps her to step outside for a few minutes for fresh air, but the babies don't love this.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA , but your hubs needs to stop sharing negativity with his fam.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping outside to take a breather is good for you and therefore good for the babies. That said - try not to make those breathers too long while babies are so upset, but it sounds like you&#39;re just taking a second to breathe and calm down. </p>\n\n<p>Dad shouldn&#39;t be saying anything but positive things about you to his family. In general, unless there is an active way they can help with something, there&#39;s not good that will come from complaining about your spouse to your family, as that will stick in their minds moving forward. If he just needed to complain about being frustrated, which is fair, he needs to go to a trusted friend. I hope you can talk to him about how much his family means to you and that him sharing complaints with his parents causes a rift in your relationship. The only reason I could imagine him mentioning this and it being positive would be for him to say, &quot;Hey fam, OP is getting really overwhelmed during the day. Totally understandable since there are three babies crying! It helps her to step outside for a few minutes for fresh air, but the babies don&#39;t love this. It would be really helpful if anyone has some free time one day to go give her a break.&quot; If they&#39;re gonna be mad about it, they can help.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you were doing something to actually harm the babies and he needed advice or help with that, obviously that&#39;s a different scenario.

Your body doesn\u2019t need to have cortisol and adrenaline dumps all day and night like that especially with three babies. Getting noise canceling headphones (to put on when you hear crying begin) is a smart suggestion for your mental and physical health. Also, your fianc\u00e9 and in-laws need to understand that it\u2019s normal for a caregiver to step out of line-of-sight briefly to calm down with one baby. You have three. You need more breaks, not fewer. So they need to step up instead of running their mouths.",

My sister was once locked out of her bathroom by my just crawling niece, and THAT is panic inducing!\n\nAnyway, as others already have said, you're doing everything right by stepping out of the situation when you feel you can't handle it.\n\nI wouldn't admit this in public, but I'm very sure I would have hurt my twins at some point if I hadn't recognised the moment to take a breather sometimes! My husband had undiagnosed sleep apnoea in the first months of our twins' lives, and with him clinically exhausted, and once even almost dropping one of our babies, it felt like I was a single mother of 3 sometimes, and I would really advise you to make your husband and his family feel what you are doing every day, 24/7!\n\nOn his next day off, tell him they are his responsibility, tell him where everything is, and then sit on the balcony with a book or a pillow for a nap, and tell him to only come and get you once he realises what he's asking you to do ALL BY YOURSELF every day.\nThis way, you can still step in when you feel like your children are in danger (I wouldn't leave a first-time stepper-upper completely alone in that situation, or it might lead to what you've been trying to avoid in you!), but you get a real break and MIGHT show him how he needs to take over some parenting duties.\n\nSame with everyone who complains.\n\nBTW, though you need to find your own way in this, some things that helped me stay sane:\n1) note down their sleep times. I did this via App, there's definitely some out there where you can put in 3 babies. This way, you'll see early on if a pattern seems to emerge when you MIGHT get them to have a nap at the same time. Combine this with\n2) get outside with them, I know it's hard to get them packed up for a stroll, to begin with, but most children fall asleep in the pram, and if you just find a nice, regular walk with some seats at good intervals so you can sit down while the children sleep, that plus fresh air helped me a lot - and I also met another twin mother on my walks in our town, and we've been friends ever since.\n3) find a routine with your partner where he HAS TO step up at reliable times. This has to be expanded on over time (we're still working on it), but we used to do it so that I had main responsibility while my husband worked from home, and then he'd take over in the evenings until about 2am, because he's a night owl, anyway. This way, I'd at least get a few hours sleep undisturbed, and believe me, handing over responsibilities is even more relaxing than sleep.\n4) find something that calms you down when your children are crying \"for no reason\" and you still want to stay with them. I often had at least one twin in a baby sling, and bobbing around to calm them started to calm me, too - especially since they often just needed the closeness, because that's what makes them happy babies - I also started humming or singing to them about what we were doing, and that worked on both me and the children, too.\n\nYou will find your way through this, OP. I often say I will tell any one who's \"thinking about having a baby\" to be very aware that there's a fair chance there will be more than one, or not necessarily one healthy baby, and to make sure they could handle THAT before they decide they're ready.\nYou grow with your tasks, OP, and the most important thing for you is to stay healthy for your children, too.",

Or show up and clean the entire house and do laundry so you can focus on bonding with the babies? </p>\n\n<p>NTA. In a perfect world we could be the most responsive parents and hold our babies any time they were upset and make it better for them but this is the real world and you had THREE screaming babies. You&#39;re not even fully healed from delivery yet. Holy shit.</p>\n</div>",

They were less than a year old, so not yet walking and were in those car seats that lock onto a base. \n\nI usually had help getting them to daycare from my roommate, a coworker who lived in the same complex, or my aunt, who lived nearby. One day, no one was available and I had to get all three to the car by myself, and my apartment wasn\u2019t near where I parked so I couldn\u2019t see my car from there. I had to decide what to do and ended up running two of the kids to the car, locking the door and then running back to get the other one. Only happened once and they were fine. Well I foolishly told their mom I did that and she was pissed! She expected me incrementally carry them all to the car at once. Like walk a few steps at a time with two, put the seats down on the ground and then go back for the other one, over and over until we made it to the car, because that\u2019s what she would have done. \n\nSo the main point I want to tell you is that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. You weren\u2019t far away, they were safe and you needed to gather yourself in order to be the best parent you could be in that moment.

Like walk a few steps at a time with two, put the seats down on the ground and then go back for the other one, over and over until we made it to the car, because that\u2019s what she would have done. </p>\n\n<p>So the main point I want to tell you is that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. You weren\u2019t far away, they were safe and you needed to gather yourself in order to be the best parent you could be in that moment. Had you not taken that time for yourself, you may not have reacted well. It\u2019s pretty sucky of your fianc\u00e9 to belittle you, when you have a lot on your  plate and no help. He more than likely wouldn\u2019t have handled things any better. Give yourself some grace. And don\u2019t apologize because you didn\u2019t do anything wrong</p>\n</div>",

It sounds like you and your fiance just need to try and have a calm conversation about trust, responsibilities and how much you both care for your kids and each other.

It's hard trusting someone with something you helped make, even if you've known that person for a long time. Not excusing his or his parents behavior, acting like you're smoking meth around the kids when you actually had a camera on them and were within 5 feet of them is a bit too much. Probably a lot of stress coming out of your fiance at you which is not fair in the slightest.\n\nAlso, where are the grandparents? You both have a shit ton on your plate and they should be the last fucking people to be scolding you when they can make the time, retired or not, to come help instead of shitting on you. Just because they are helping with the roof over your head/financial stuff, doesn't exclude them from giving you a break a few days during the week/month. \n\nIF they live too far away for that, then they really should just shut the fuck up because that kind of talk is completely useless, and stress inducing which is exactly the opposite way you should be talking to the mother of your brand new fucking TRIPLET GRANDKIDS.\n\nI've been a stay at home dad for 6 years now, shit is ROUGH some days, even more rough when the few people in your circle seem to not understand your actions or downplay the work you are doing.

Say your peace to your partner and his parents and continue on doing the best for you and the kids. \n\nIf what you said in your post is true, than you are extremely far away from bad mother material, and it sounds like you need a bit more help from these people in either the way they talk to you/listen to you or more actual breaks away from the kids.

I. Was. Worn. Out. \n\nBut when he was a newborn, maybe 3 weeks old, I was about to lose my mind. I called my pediatrician and asked what to do. The nurse told me to lay him down in his crib, put the iPad in his room where I could face time to my phone, pour myself a cup of coffee and go sit on the back porch for 20 minutes in silence. He didn\u2019t stop crying but I was a lot more chill and could handle him better. It became a daily routine until I went back to work. \nHe\u2019s still my worst sleeper- has to take melatonin or sleepy time tea every night before bed or he won\u2019t fall asleep till after midnight, and his eyes pop open at 530 every single morning without fail. At least it\u2019s 530 now, for many years it was 445.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Heck when my oldest (now 11yo) was a newborn he screamed from the time he woke up till the time he went to sleep unless he was eating, and would only sleep in 1 hour stretches till he was 18 months. I. Was. Worn. Out. </p>\n\n<p>But when he was a newborn, maybe 3 weeks old, I was about to lose my mind. I called my pediatrician and asked what to do. The nurse told me to lay him down in his crib, put the iPad in his room where I could face time to my phone, pour myself a cup of coffee and go sit on the back porch for 20 minutes in silence. He didn\u2019t stop crying but I was a lot more chill and could handle him better. It became a daily routine until I went back to work. \nHe\u2019s still my worst sleeper- has to take melatonin or sleepy time tea every night before bed or he won\u2019t fall asleep till after midnight, and his eyes pop open at 530 every single morning without fail. At least it\u2019s 530 now, for many years it was 445.

You're doing nothing wrong and this pisses me off beyond what I can convey in a reddit comment. My wife also had to do this hell we had to do it together a couple times.\n\nI'm guessing you do 90% of the child care because he works so he has no fucking idea what it's like to be with a crying baby alone for hours on end and YOU GOT 3 OF THEM! alone with 3 damn newborns, that's a level of stress I don't envy in the least but I do sympathize.\n\nI would tell your fiance to read these comments because he's WAY the fuck out of touch with what you're going through and should have blisters on his lips from kissing your ass in an apology. Next time he has a day off leave him home alone and see how long it takes him to call you or his mommy to come home and save him before he snaps.\n\nI can't even focus on nice and reassuring things that I would like to say to you because of how angry I am to think this kid had the fucking balls to come in and insult you like that over something he clearly doesn't know shit about. I will say you can do better than someone like that and if he doesn't get his head out of his ass then I think you should try and find that person who will treat you with the respect you deserve.\n\nIf you see this fiance then be better and learn about what the mother of YOUR children is going through and help her. Don't come home and insult her and bite her fucking head off for needing a moment to release the stress you clearly haven't felt because if you had you would know why she's sitting out there and why it's ok.

You need other parents who are going through what you're going through, who have been through it, who understand what it reasonable to expect and what is not, and who understand when you need to vent and let you say things like \"I want to throw this kid out the window\" without freaking out or calling you names because they know you're just venting and WE ALL NEED IT -- and WE HAVE ALL SAID IT.\n\nFind parenting groups here on Reddit or on Facebook or whichever social media you prefer. Back when my kid was an infant, Twitter was still a working platform and I developed a group of moms I found though hashtags (relating to gentle parenting, breastfeeding, etc.) Those \"strangers on the internet\" were LIFESAVERS -- they shared information and advice, we could vent together, they offered support and validation, and answered all the questions I didn't know where to ask. \n\n(My kid had night terrors way earlier usual/when the books said it would happen.

He can go back to school when the kids are in preschool.\n\nHe HAS to help, and nobody gives a flying fuck if he is \"tired,\" because unless he's been home with THREE WHOLE ENTIRE INFANTS all day, he doesn't even begin to fathom the idea of what \"tired\" *really* means.\n\nHe has to step up.\n\nAnd he needs to be on YOUR side, not tattling to his mommy and daddy.\n\nI am worried about you, because your situation is such a perfectly crafted stage set for abuse.

He said if i didn&#39;t start taking care of it when i did i could&#39;ve ended up in a cast or caused irreparable damage to my tendons in my wrist. Now when it&#39;s rainy my wrist aches. All because i was too tired to recognize i wasn&#39;t lifting my baby properly out of the crib in a way that was causing me extreme pain.</p>\n</div>",
