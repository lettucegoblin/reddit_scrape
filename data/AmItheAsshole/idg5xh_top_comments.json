        "body": "NTA, and my dear poor harried Internet stranger, please don't let them into your head. Look at how you phrased this question: \"not letting my cousin experience motherhood.\" Life did that, and it sucks, but you didn't do that. This question would more reasonably be phrased \"not wanting to be separated from my 10-month-old baby for months so that my cousin and her fiance can pretend it's theirs.\" That's a totally reasonable position!\n\nGrief can make people lose their minds a bit, especially when you're watching cancer destroy a young life that was full of promise. I'm not saying that they are horrible people, but they are letting grief dictate their actions in wildly unreasonable ways. I know it's terrible to see cancer destroy your daughter's life and her hopes of being a mother, but the answer is not to relentlessly hound a young mother to give up her child to you - and with some pretty damned dehumanizing language, because that \"popped them out\" crap is just crude and cruel.\n\nI know that they are angry with life and with the injustice of their daughter's early death, but don't let them convince you that it's reasonable for them to turn that anger and resentment around on you. If you can, try to see them as people whose reason is coming apart in the face of this terrible loss. Speak to them as kindly as you can, but remember that they are not behaving rationally and you should not go along with their demands. Empathize with their grief, but don't tell yourself that you have to cure it; unfortunately, nothing can. The best thing you can do is to urge them to seek professional help in dealing with this extremely painful loss and to be polite, gentle, but absolutely immovable on the topic of splitting up your own family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: WHOAH! Walk away for 7 hours and things go crazy. Thanks for all of the love, folks. I really appreciate the pretty bling and kind words. :) For unrelated reasons, this has been a crazy, hectic, stressful day for me, so thank you all very much for making the end of the day great.",

It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.\n\nThey started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.\n\nI had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for \"a few weeks\". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.\n\nIt's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.\n\nI'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.\n\nI'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.\n\nI said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I \"popped them out so close together\". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your REAL LIVE baby is not a prop. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do anything, BUT if you are trying to think of something to appease the situation/help the girl get her mothering experience, consider buying them one of the hyper real dolls. I have seen photos of dolls that look crazy realistic. That doll is an ACTUAL PROP, and would be perfect for their photo shoots. Send it over with a few baby items like you would for a baby shower. \n\nAgain, you are not obligated in any way to appease this behavior, as asking for your daughter is an absurd request. However, if this is your husband\u2019s family and you are going to have to see them in the future. They are most likely grieving but are unable to process it, manic in their pursuit to fill a lifetime of experiences into a few short weeks. Sending them a gift (or even recommending they purchase it) might be seen as a compassionate thing for a girl to get her dying wish of being a (doll) mother",

Will they post these pictures online? Your kids can&#39;t consent to that. They&#39;re not toys. This is a tragic situation, but using living children as stand ins when those kids are going to grow up and probably find this weird as hell is not the answer. I know I would and would totally question my parents&#39; sanity for letting that happen.</p>\n</div>",

Like it starts choking and these two people can't save it in time? Or since they've never had kids they don't understand that if you have your eyes off your kid for just TWO seconds they can do something stupid to harm themselves accidentally? There's just so many possibilities...OP has gone through being a mother since the day her kid was born up until now. That's 10 months of crucial experience. That's making some mistakes and learning from them. This husband and wife have absolutely no experience in how to raise a baby. A 10 month old is hard work. What if they don't know what to do or don't know how to deal with the reality of being a parent? Adding onto the grieving process I think this is just a recipe for disaster. \n\nSo yeah, in every single way, the safety of the child is at risk. Being mishandled and even worse could very well happen. I really hope OP considers all this and doesn't feel any guilt in not letting these people have her baby. Even if none of this was likely to happen at all, I still think not wanting to give her baby away is completely valid. Tbh, I wouldn't even give my kid away for a day. \n\nAlso, I'm so sorry that happened to you. Something traumatic happened to me as a kid as well that's made me realise you can't even trust the people who should be caring for you at times. But tbh I don't think we're paranoid at all.",
