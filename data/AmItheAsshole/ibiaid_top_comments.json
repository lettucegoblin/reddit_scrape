You dodged a bulletin. Cheating is a deal-breaker for a lot of people (like me) for good reason - the breaking of trust and respect that it signifies. The least she could have done was come clean about it immediately if she had any respect for you, but she just showed you that she didn\u2019t. You dodged a damn bullet, and it\u2019s because she couldn\u2019t respect you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong - you had boundaries, made them clear, and when you were aware she crossed them, you confronted her about it and she handled it badly. Actions have consequences, that\u2019s just how it is and she couldn\u2019t respect that. You were dignified throughout this, and standing your moral ground here was absolutely the right thing to do, if only for yourself - and that\u2019s not a bad thing, either. That\u2019s great and very healthy.\nIt sucks right now, but being betrayed does that to you. You\u2019ll be able to get passed this, you\u2019re just in a slump right now. It\u2019s perfectly normal and justified to feel down right now, and to not feel like you\u2019re in the wrong for the downturn of your situation. You feel this way because you felt you ruined your happiness, and you didn\u2019t - _she_ did, you were just trying to be responsible with the situation, and sometimes, that means doing hard and unpleasant things. You\u2019ll be alright again. And there is definitely someone out there who respects and shares your values who you may find yourself wanting to marry someday, should you be looking. Just let yourself heal in the now, and don\u2019t forget about the people who _do_ care and respect you, like Kate. You don\u2019t need to contact her immediately, but if you need space, tell your people that. They\u2019ll have a lot of questions, and you don\u2019t need to answer in depth, but they should respect a brief \u201cI broke off the engagement, and I just need some space right now,\u201d when they ask.

I didn\u2019t instantly think she had cheated, just that she was clearly immature/jealous. \n\nI\u2019m female, some of my closest friends are male. The longest friendships of those are about 18 years now I guess from college (holy I feel old). If I was getting married with a wedding party, I\u2019d want to figure out putting them in there, though my oldest female friends (from age 6 so 30!! years) would likely be insulted. \n\nIn the opposite realm, one of those male buddies had this girlfriend. Terrible, terrible girlfriend, won\u2019t get into details but she was abusing him in every way. While he was disappearing left and right to friends and family... I got it worse than our other buddy (in college we were a trio, we functioned best that way and got along way less well in any pairing). I could hear her freaking out in the background, he couldn\u2019t talk, he couldn\u2019t hang out. When he finally left her she talked to me online right before and while she claimed she didn\u2019t feel romantically jealous, she didn\u2019t act particularly different or say anything that wasn\u2019t still jealous. Never ever had any intimate contact with those guys. She admitted jealousy of his time, attention... it sounded like a need to control everything. And honestly, other stuff she talked about \u2014 that she couldn\u2019t help but abuse him and stuff like that... she probably cheated on him too. Ultimately, this kind of crazy makes all women somehow look bad. Like your friend Kate ends up a bad guy to some and Jasmin ends up a bad guy. But Kate did nothing but be friends with a guy. Sad. It\u2019s 2020. \n\nHopefully you can try and move past, cause you didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all. And hopefully you can find a self-confident, mature woman to be with in future. you really didn\u2019t do anything wrong and sticking up for your close friendship and saying you won\u2019t compromise because of gender legit makes you extra cool. So you clearly need an extra cool partner.",

I read your original post a few minutes ago and agree that you should be able to have the person you are closest with, be that male or female, as your best man. It\u2019s happening more and more in this generations weddings. The fact that people instantly think there\u2019s some kind of seedy love connection is just stupid. There is no reason that a man and woman cannot be best friends without there being something between the two of them. It\u2019s called being adults. Good luck to you and things will work out for the best. They always do. Oh, and since you all never got married, etiquette states she should return the ring.

I read your original post a few minutes ago and agree that you should be able to have the person you are closest with, be that male or female, as your best man. It\u2019s happening more and more in this generations weddings. The fact that people instantly think there\u2019s some kind of seedy love connection is just stupid.

For what it's worth, you were NTA then and you're still not TA now (obviously).\n\nI've been the female best man for my two best friends' weddings (we're all mid-30s now, but this was between 5-10 years ago). Neither of the brides had an issue with it because they both knew our relationship was completely platonic, and one of the brides I was friendly with, but we weren't friends (the other bride I was super close with).\n\nI think it ultimately comes down to your ex being incapable of trusting you because she knew she couldn't be trusted. I know it sucks to learn the lesson this way, but *without exception* we initially judge others based on our experience and what *we* would do. So if a partner \"just doesn't trust\" your friendship with a woman and can't provide a rational, reasonable explanation, you can bet money on the fact that it's because she doesn't think that she could be trusted in the same situation.\n\nYou mentioned that you're struggling to convince yourself that this wasn't all your fault. I sympathize with you deeply. Try to remember that she cheated before you even got engaged, so nothing about this Kate argument caused your relationship to end.\n\nIt goes without saying that it would've been better if she hadn't cheated and you two could've worked out this argument, but she had already sabotaged the relationship long before this argument, so it's a good thing you found out before the wedding. Keep Kate as the close friend she is; afterall, you found out the truth because you stood up for that friendship! You'll find the right person in due time. Until then, lean on the real people you have... You're lucky to have them.",
