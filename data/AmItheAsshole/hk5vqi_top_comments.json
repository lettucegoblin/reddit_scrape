My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.\n\nMy husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.\n\nEventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. \n\nI filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you don't stop this now, it won't stop, it will escalate. Literally google \"Son/daughter/brother/sister/mother stole from me\" stories. Many of them will be further down the timeline from you and you'll see the behaviour continues if you enable them by not stopping them. \n\nI feel so sorry for your son's girlfriend, she sounds like she has integrity, and he put her in a really gross position. I would have a chat with her and express that you are thankful, because in the position that your son put her in, she had everything to gain, and nothing to lose if she didn't tell you. She went with the route that was actively damaging to her despite that. For her, it's not about the T.V. it's about the fact that your son will see this as her \"betraying him\". He might end up blaming her for any hardship he caused himself by stealing from you instead of using this as a moment of self reflection. \n\nThey live together during a pandemic where income, and job availability rates are as low as the great depression. If she needs to get out of her relationship with your son, she could be in a very bad position. Please be sure that you mirror that integrity if their relationship ends, see if you or your daughter can give her shelter if she needs to start looking for a new place to live. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. At the end of the day, I know you're not even really mad about the T.V. It's the betrayal of trust from someone that you still love. Even worse, we will often excuse abuse against ourselves by people we love to spare the relationship, but he also took advantage of his sister/your daughter, and blamed his 4 year old niece. This is someone you love abusing other people you love as well. It's a very confusing thing to navigate, don't expect yourself to be perfect in how you move forward with this. Just remember that you DO have to move forward with this.\n\nThe MOST important thing to remember is this, explanations are not excuses. If your son is anything like my half siblings, there is always a f*cking excuse. There is always a \"reason\" why their bad behaviours are not their fault, and why they're actually the victims, and they will try to make you feel like the bad guy for holding them accountable for what they did, because they already feel SOOOOO bad about it. It's bullshit. It's emotional abuse on top of what they did. Don't buy it. Explanations are not excuses, their behaviours are their own and they need to own them.\n\nGood luck OP, you can DM me if you need a complete stranger over the internet to vent to in anonymity.

The old tenant left some of his furniture to pick up later (in the living room) and he still had a key.\n\nI went out for an hour to the grocery store on day 2 in the apartment and when I get back, his furniture is gone.... along with my computer and about $2000 of electronics.\n\nI called the police. An officer came by. He was like \"why did the old tenant have a key?\" and i was like \"my landlord wanted him to pick up his furniture.\" The cop was like \"that's too bad, because without forced entry, I can't do anything.\" This was in Chicago.\n\nThe cop did call the former tenant (landlord had his number) and gave him a stern talking-to, \"You could save yourself a lot of trouble by returning the computer!\" but the guy denied it, calling the cop's bluff. We knew the guy's address too, but the cop said he wouldn't even go to the guy's place.\n\nOP's son didn't force entry. He was invited in. Cops went to the son's home, but they were let in by the GF. The police haven't arrested and the prosecutor hasn't pressed charges, so we don't know if they will do that.\n\nAll I'm saying is that if the son just says \"I thought they wouldn't mind! I was just borrowing it for a little while! they're always giving me stuff like this, it was just a little mix up!\" the case becomes exponentially more complicated.\n\nI just googled a bit about theft from houses where you were invited in and a retired cop says those situations are \"problematic\" because someone who is invited can think of a dozen excuses for why they took things and the prosecution will have to show why each excuse isn't true. And it's little, interpersonal things like \"I was going to give it back after the big game! I thought mom was OK with that!\" that you'll need the rest of  the family to be united on for the several months or years these processes take.",

The old tenant left some of his furniture to pick up later (in the living room) and he still had a key.</p>\n\n<p>I went out for an hour to the grocery store on day 2 in the apartment and when I get back, his furniture is gone.... along with my computer and about $2000 of electronics.</p>\n\n<p>I called the police. An officer came by. He was like &quot;why did the old tenant have a key?&quot; and i was like &quot;my landlord wanted him to pick up his furniture.&quot; The cop was like &quot;that&#39;s too bad, because without forced entry, I can&#39;t do anything.&quot; This was in Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>The cop did call the former tenant (landlord had his number) and gave him a stern talking-to, &quot;You could save yourself a lot of trouble by returning the computer!&quot; but the guy denied it, calling the cop&#39;s bluff. We knew the guy&#39;s address too, but the cop said he wouldn&#39;t even go to the guy&#39;s place.</p>\n\n<p>OP&#39;s son didn&#39;t force entry. He was invited in. Cops went to the son&#39;s home, but they were let in by the GF. The police haven&#39;t arrested and the prosecutor hasn&#39;t pressed charges, so we don&#39;t know if they will do that.</p>\n\n<p>All I&#39;m saying is that if the son just says &quot;I thought they wouldn&#39;t mind! I was just borrowing it for a little while! they&#39;re always giving me stuff like this, it was just a little mix up!&quot; the case becomes exponentially more complicated.</p>\n\n<p>I just googled a bit about theft from houses where you were invited in and a retired cop says those situations are &quot;problematic&quot; because someone who is invited can think of a dozen excuses for why they took things and the prosecution will have to show why each excuse isn&#39;t true. And it&#39;s little, interpersonal things like &quot;I was going to give it back after the big game! I thought mom was OK with that!&quot; that you&#39;ll need the rest of  the family to be united on for the several months or years these processes take.</p>\n</div>",
