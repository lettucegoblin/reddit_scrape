Doing the right thing and being a good person isn&#39;t always appreciated by other human beings.. especially girls in your age group. You are beyond your years. You are able to look past the &#39;popular&#39; thing and be an upstanding individual. You will be rewarded in the future because your heart won&#39;t be tainted by actions or words driven by acceptance of others who don&#39;t actually matter to your life.</p>\n\n<p>Your parents are most likely afraid of what might come from your actions. Obviously the bullying and anything else that might come up. I&#39;m sure they are proud they have raised someone with values and a strong head on their shoulders. Those things will carry you far in life. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately those same girls that are taunting you are simply sheep and eventually/hopefully will see the ugly they had put out into the world and drown in the guilt. Maybe not. </p>\n\n<p>You are a wonderful person. NTA.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully your friend knows how beautiful she is in her hijab. \u2764</p>\n</div>",

I said, &quot;You can&#39;t do that: that&#39;s a choice I have to make for God, not a choice you or anyone can make for me.&quot; He immediately softened and  apologised and said, &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right. I am wrong.&quot; I don&#39;t always get on with my father - typical immigrant dad/third culture kid culture clash - but I always appreciated he was so in touch with his religious beliefs in a way that compelled deep reflection rather than obstinance.</p>\n</div>",
