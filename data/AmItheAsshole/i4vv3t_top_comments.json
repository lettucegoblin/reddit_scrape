Her parents worked so hard with her, helping her to learn to lip read and speak (they refused to substitute regular speech for sign language as they wanted her to be able to access mainstream education, and were castigated for it - my wife has since been called a traitor by an advocate for the Deaf community, an advocate who wasn\u2019t deaf, incidentally, for not signing), and ensuring that she had all the same opportunities that a hearing child could get.\n\nShe\u2019s done alright. She has a joint honours Batchelor\u2019s degree from a well respected UK university.  She has a Master\u2019s degree from the same University. She is very successful in her career, to the point that she was recognised as being the best in the country, got invited to tour the House of Commons, and was invited to one of the Queen\u2019s Garden Parties at Buck House.\n\nYour child can do whatever they want, and be whatever they want, and can excel as much as any other child.

Every evil comment from him, his family, his friends, don't act.  Don't react.  Save them, send such things to your lawyer, and let them do their job.  When you interact with him, no matter how much you hate him, or are enraged be polite, calm, and firm.\n\nA person who acts like this is going to do a much better job sinking their own ship, than you will do by retaliating to his childish and boorish behavior.

It hurts so bad to bite your tongue and let this person say whatever he wants.  It's human nature to fight back.  In this case it's counterproductive.

        "body": "To give the parents some benefit: While a lot of parents don't learn ASL, many of them do learn homesign, which is basically creating your own language using hand symbols to communicate with your deaf children. iirc over 80% of people who are deaf use homesign with their families or friends, so not all is lost.\n\nAnd in general... most deaf people would agree that there's 3 \"schools of thought\" when it comes to raising deaf children. The 3 methods are:\n\n1. Raising your deaf child in a hearing environment (e.g not using ASL, teaching your child to read lips, etc.)\n2. Raising your deaf child in a completely deaf environment (e.g only using ASL, sending your child to a deaf school)\n3. Raising your deaf child in a mixed environment (e.g not using ASL at home, BUT sending your child to a school that does use ASL)\n\nThere's debate on which method works best, however all methods have been successful for deaf children. Linguists and language psychologists agree that as long as there's consistent communication (whether that be ASL, homesign, or just talking and pointing), then deaf children can grow up to have normal and successful lives.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>To give the parents some benefit: While a lot of parents don&#39;t learn ASL, many of them do learn homesign, which is basically creating your own language using hand symbols to communicate with your deaf children. iirc over 80% of people who are deaf use homesign with their families or friends, so not all is lost.</p>\n\n<p>And in general... most deaf people would agree that there&#39;s 3 &quot;schools of thought&quot; when it comes to raising deaf children. The 3 methods are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Raising your deaf child in a hearing environment (e.g not using ASL, teaching your child to read lips, etc.)</li>\n<li>Raising your deaf child in a completely deaf environment (e.g only using ASL, sending your child to a deaf school)</li>\n<li>Raising your deaf child in a mixed environment (e.g not using ASL at home, BUT sending your child to a school that does use ASL)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There&#39;s debate on which method works best, however all methods have been successful for deaf children.

It might've taken dozens of conversations to address them all privately.
