Southwest gave me a $100 voucher for that. It was totally unnecessary, but it was a nice gesture.</p>\n\n<p>ETA: For OP, NTA.</p>\n</div>",

And the longer the flight the more uncomfortable they get. And it's because airlines are trying to make more money per flight so instead of fitting only 2 seats they put 3... Or instead of having X amount of rows of seats they add a few extra rows and leave a few at a normal distance which they sell as extra legs room...  There's nothing to be ashamed of about your size or decision to buy an extra seat. You were considerate both towards you and your neighboring passengers. The only assholes are the two who didn't get their seats together from the get go and felt entitled on your comfort seat. Next time put your purse on the comfort seat at least temporarily till the flight takes off/ or a light coat to physically fully claim it so you don't have to deal with bs like this. Edit: a scarf will also work",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m a very small woman both in height and weight (XS size) and still find the regular plane seats waaay too small to be comfortable, especially on the front side for the knees... And the longer the flight the more uncomfortable they get. And it&#39;s because airlines are trying to make more money per flight so instead of fitting only 2 seats they put 3... Or instead of having X amount of rows of seats they add a few extra rows and leave a few at a normal distance which they sell as extra legs room...  There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of about your size or decision to buy an extra seat. You were considerate both towards you and your neighboring passengers. The only assholes are the two who didn&#39;t get their seats together from the get go and felt entitled on your comfort seat. Next time put your purse on the comfort seat at least temporarily till the flight takes off/ or a light coat to physically fully claim it so you don&#39;t have to deal with bs like this.
