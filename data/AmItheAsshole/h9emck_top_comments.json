I can empathize with you if you've been through that experience before, but it's not right to color that judgment so broadly. Men perpetrate abuse, women perpetrate abuse, non-binary people perpetrate abuse; everyone is capable of it.

If this wasn't your thought process when making that kind of past, I would say you are a liar, and a bad one at that. I imagine that someone has plenty of reasons to never blab fully about their personal lives. In this case, it could very well be that OP doesn't like retreading ground that was examined in court closely for the internet. Who are you to feel entitled to that information?

That I prioritized the validation from internet strangers over the man l loved?  No way was that going to happen.  Someone had to be the bad guy and it wasn\u2019t going to be her.  So ta da! Emotional abuse videos!  She probably got tons of views and sympathy.  So when he gets pissed and sues, there is no way for her to walk that back now, got to go for it.  \n\nSo everyone here saying that OP could have been emotionally abusive and she had a right, you don\u2019t know that.  Just like I don\u2019t know if the above scenario is true.  But if I had to put money down, I would go with mine.  \n\nAnd people, can we stop jumping on \u201cyou\u2019re the abusive one\u201d just because he is a guy?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>All I\u2019m thinking is that the relationship was good content for the ex and her following liked them as a couple.  Now OP leaves as he isn\u2019t into all that and it becomes too much for him and what is she going to say to her following?  He said YT was more important to me than him? That I prioritized the validation from internet strangers over the man l loved?  No way was that going to happen.  Someone had to be the bad guy and it wasn\u2019t going to be her.  So ta da! Emotional abuse videos!  She probably got tons of views and sympathy.  So when he gets pissed and sues, there is no way for her to walk that back now, got to go for it.  </p>\n\n<p>So everyone here saying that OP could have been emotionally abusive and she had a right, you don\u2019t know that.  Just like I don\u2019t know if the above scenario is true.  But if I had to put money down, I would go with mine.  </p>\n\n<p>And people, can we stop jumping on \u201cyou\u2019re the abusive one\u201d just because he is a guy?

The ruling suggests that was the issue, as again the payment for damages was linking to the comment section. The exact source of these threats was the video, and his only option was to either get the video removed (which neither YouTube or the GF were going to do based on viewership alone). Or filing in court. And for all we know, he did ask her to remove it. The OP neither states this was his first or last attempt.
