        "body": "NTA\n\nYour title would be more accurate if it was AITA for selling the family home because my family are A's ;) because, damn. You have the patience of a saint. \n\nJust because they're family doesn't mean they get to walk all over you, take advantage of you, or be disrespectful. Even if you're the \"baby\" of the family and received the majority of the inheritance. Which, obviously goes to show you're the only decent person in the family. Js\n\nThey're bitter and moochers. Your brother got 10k, he can easily go buy his pregnant wife food. She is HIS responsibility to take care of. He could use the money for a cheap little one bedroom and food and look for a job. Your mother doesn't get to dictate how your house is used, who gets to live in it, or who you need to accomodate; she doesn't own the house and you are an adult. They sound toxic as hell, and entitled, plus, it doesn't sound like any of them work (?). *If* I was super generous I would evict them and maybe pay for a hotel for 4 days from them to stay in and then they figure it out. But, that's me trying not to burn the entire bridge. \n\n\nJust because they are acting like douche canoes doesn't mean you have to sell the house. If you truly love the house and want to live in it, keep it. Get the law on your side and evict them. Making adult decisions aren't always easy peasy. If you need an appraisor to see how much your house is worth (if it really is 100 y.o.), you could sell it to your uncle and negotiate. But, if it is that age, and depending on updates it prob would be a financial investment to get things up to code if you were putting it technically on the market. Or could always sell \"as is\" to your uncle if you don't want to bother and don't actually want the house etc. \n\nBe proud of yourself for sticking up to your family. You sound responsible, and you sound like you have allowed your buttons to be pushed continually and taken advantage of, and they have finally pushed it too far. Having boundaries for yourself is healthy and empowering. \n\nI might recommend a camera in the house if you're not staying. Or, making sure you stop in every day to make sure they don't thrash it, especially since you're moving back in or selling it. They're not legally tenants or on any paperwork to live there, so you can legally kick them out. Don't abandon it because depending on where you live squatters do eventually get rights. \nThey are all adults and have a small financial cushion to use, from their inheritance, to get themselves back on their feet. You are not responsible for people who need to do better and know better. Family or not. \n\nYou're young. This is a small bump in the road in your life. Don't let it derail you. It's an easy fix, even though it will be emotionally draining. \n\nYou hold all the cards, play them. \nGood luck",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA</p>\n\n<p>Your title would be more accurate if it was AITA for selling the family home because my family are A&#39;s ;) because, damn. You have the patience of a saint. </p>\n\n<p>Just because they&#39;re family doesn&#39;t mean they get to walk all over you, take advantage of you, or be disrespectful. Even if you&#39;re the &quot;baby&quot; of the family and received the majority of the inheritance. Which, obviously goes to show you&#39;re the only decent person in the family. Js</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re bitter and moochers. Your brother got 10k, he can easily go buy his pregnant wife food. She is HIS responsibility to take care of. He could use the money for a cheap little one bedroom and food and look for a job. Your mother doesn&#39;t get to dictate how your house is used, who gets to live in it, or who you need to accomodate; she doesn&#39;t own the house and you are an adult. They sound toxic as hell, and entitled, plus, it doesn&#39;t sound like any of them work (?). <em>If</em> I was super generous I would evict them and maybe pay for a hotel for 4 days from them to stay in and then they figure it out. But, that&#39;s me trying not to burn the entire bridge. </p>\n\n<p>Just because they are acting like douche canoes doesn&#39;t mean you have to sell the house.

Unless they're paying for your school, or you're not in the US or something, you are the adult here, and you don't HAVE to do anything you don't want to do.  What are they going to do, send you to your room?  I mean, it's YOUR ROOM in YOUR HOUSE.  YOU HAVE ALL THE LEVERAGE HERE, so start acting like it.  When they tell you to go to McDonald's, just laugh in their faces and tell them to fuck off.\n\nInstead of yelling at them, start legal eviction proceedings.  Talk to a lawyer about how to send them bills for back rent.  Record and document EVERYTHING, so you can sue them, if need be, for damages they incur on their way out.  Change the lock on your bedroom door, for fuck's sake.  Eat THEIR food then lock your fridge, put up surveillance cameras, and generally protect yourself.  If they leave their crap all over the house, throw it out or sell it.\n\nYou don't need to sell your house, you need to get the deadbeats out.  Invest in a small air horn, if you have to, to drown them out when they argue with you.  You own the house, you make the rules, and you don't have to brook any dissent.  Lock down the thermostat, and keep it at the minimally legal temps for habitation, especially if you aren't even staying there.  Have their cars towed if they park on the grass.  Or tell them they have to use street parking, and tow them if they park in the driveway.\n\nIf you do decide to sell (and you should only do that if YOU WANT to, not because THEY're making you desperate or crazy), make sure you check with some realtors to see if the deal your uncle is offering is really as good as it sounds.  If not, you can put it on the market and see what it will bring.  If it is, use a lawyer to make sure he doesn't try to screw you over, or give you an IOU for the balance of the house.  Keep everything official and above-board.  If he can't afford to give you the price now, he can get a mortgage like everyone else who buys a house.\n\nEdit:  If you do sell for a large sum of money, please be smart with it.  It's pretty amazing how quickly a \"life-changing\" amount of money can disappear once you buy a car, pay off tuition, get another place to stay, and have a little bit of fun.  Being 18 with a large sum of money is a bad combination - accept that, and get legitimate help with setting yourself up (an actual financial advisor of some sort, not your friend's cousin who made a ton in stocks that one time - and don't let anybody convince you to invest in their personal business).  A truly life-changing amount of money should set you up for a long time, IF YOU ARE SMART ABOUT IT.  It can mean you won't have to worry too much about retirement, but it probably won't also mean that you don't have to work for a living until then.",

What are they going to do, send you to your room?  I mean, it&#39;s YOUR ROOM in YOUR HOUSE.  YOU HAVE ALL THE LEVERAGE HERE, so start acting like it.  When they tell you to go to McDonald&#39;s, just laugh in their faces and tell them to fuck off.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of yelling at them, start legal eviction proceedings.  Talk to a lawyer about how to send them bills for back rent.  Record and document EVERYTHING, so you can sue them, if need be, for damages they incur on their way out.  Change the lock on your bedroom door, for fuck&#39;s sake.  Eat THEIR food then lock your fridge, put up surveillance cameras, and generally protect yourself.  If they leave their crap all over the house, throw it out or sell it.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t need to sell your house, you need to get the deadbeats out.  Invest in a small air horn, if you have to, to drown them out when they argue with you.  You own the house, you make the rules, and you don&#39;t have to brook any dissent.  Lock down the thermostat, and keep it at the minimally legal temps for habitation, especially if you aren&#39;t even staying there.  Have their cars towed if they park on the grass.  Or tell them they have to use street parking, and tow them if they park in the driveway.</p>\n\n<p>If you do decide to sell (and you should only do that if YOU WANT to, not because THEY&#39;re making you desperate or crazy), make sure you check with some realtors to see if the deal your uncle is offering is really as good as it sounds.  If not, you can put it on the market and see what it will bring.  If it is, use a lawyer to make sure he doesn&#39;t try to screw you over, or give you an IOU for the balance of the house.  Keep everything official and above-board.  If he can&#39;t afford to give you the price now, he can get a mortgage like everyone else who buys a house.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  If you do sell for a large sum of money, please be smart with it.  It&#39;s pretty amazing how quickly a &quot;life-changing&quot; amount of money can disappear once you buy a car, pay off tuition, get another place to stay, and have a little bit of fun.  Being 18 with a large sum of money is a bad combination - accept that, and get legitimate help with setting yourself up (an actual financial advisor of some sort, not your friend&#39;s cousin who made a ton in stocks that one time - and don&#39;t let anybody convince you to invest in their personal business).  A truly life-changing amount of money should set you up for a long time, IF YOU ARE SMART ABOUT IT.  It can mean you won&#39;t have to worry too much about retirement, but it probably won&#39;t also mean that you don&#39;t have to work for a living until then.</p>\n</div>",

It sounds like a solid offer from your uncle, but speak with a realtor to ensure you are getting a fair offer. I would also highly recommend you get a plan in place for rolling the money into a stable investment that will last, whether it\u2019s a home or long term investments. Also consider if you really want to permanently part with your father\u2019s home. You could always evict your brother and rent it out until a time that makes sense to live back in.\n\nEdit- OP states uncle is offering $100k less than estimated worth. This is a hit too large to take in my opinion just to get rid of SIL. If you can\u2019t stand up to them in your own home, are you going to be able to stand up to them when they beg and plead and lay on the emotional manipulation for the cash you get out of the house?  \n\nStep 1: you need to lay out some boundaries that will be enforced immediately. SIL doesn\u2019t touch your things or your food. Mom stays out of your room and does not get a key. If anyone breaks these rules, you move toward immediate eviction proceedings. \n\nStep 2: speak with a lawyer and become better educated in eviction law. Be prepared to serve 30 day notice to your brother and SIL, and mom if necessary. \n\nStep 3: brother needs a plan to move out. If he knows you are serious about resorting to eviction, he will figure something out. You are not his only option, you\u2019re just the cheapest one. \n\nStep 4: get a therapist. You need to talk to someone impartial. It sounds like your family has beaten you down for many years. You need to have someone in your court who can help you build yourself back up. This will be impossible to do living in close quarters with ungrateful people who treat you with no respect. \n\nStep 5: figure out what you want to do with your house. There is a lot of space between selling and living with your miserable family. You could rent it out for awhile and live alone in a smaller place. This would actually be my recommendation. You could get away from your family, maintain your home equity, and rent someplace smaller and more peaceful for yourself. No matter what you do, don\u2019t let your mom or brother manipulate you out of your home or earnings from your home. Your father left this to you to build your future.

Your mother had to live somewhere and he probably imagined you\u2019d never kick her out. Although you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re too young to navigate all alone the emotional and mental games these fully grown adults are playing with you. I don\u2019t think your father anticipated this. It happens. Perhaps there were ways to structure the house so that this couldn\u2019t happen, but that ship has likely sailed.\n\nA house, especially if in a good neighborhood, is likely the most valuable thing anyone will ever own. You need guidance from people who are completely in your corner. People that are bound by rules and laws to not take advantage of you. A lawyer is an excellent person to help you. It can be difficult to interview and hire a lawyer. You also need an independent opinion of what the family home is worth.\n\nHowever, I think you may have some luck. First, it\u2019s very likely that your father used an attorney to prepare his estate documents. Who was that attorney? Was that person also the executor for the will? Contact that person and have a conversation about the situation. You can ask for referrals to other attorneys, too. Attorneys often give a prospective client 30 minutes of time free to discuss their case and understand what is at stake. Use that time to decide if you think you can work with the attorney. YOU are the client and in charge. You have the power.\n\nAlso, the process of resolving your father\u2019s affairs would very likely have had to value the house. Those documents may be public, if the transfer happened by a Will, or private if he set up a Trust of some sort. You should have a conversation with the executor or lawyer and get copies of all of the documents and valuations of the estate that you are allowed to have (probably everything). If it\u2019s electronic, you can put it in the cloud. If it\u2019s paperwork, you may need to find a place to keep it and other documents important to you that aren\u2019t accessible by your mom and brother. A safe at a friend\u2019s or better a safe deposit box at a bank.\n\nAnyway, you should think about you mother and brother as people that will take advantage of you completely and don\u2019t trust them. Don\u2019t trust them with Information. Don\u2019t trust them with your phone or computer. Don\u2019t trust them with your house - they may destroy things if they are getting kicked out.\n\nFigure out if your house is insured. I have seen terrible betrayals by family over inheritances. This is far too common a thing to happen.\n\nYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong. They\u2019ve taken advantage of you. Find trustworthy people to advise and protect you. Be active. Take action.\n\nAlso, find a therapist you can trust, too. Maybe start with your school as they often have therapists for free or a low price.\n\nI know it will be hard juggling school, managing a large valuable asset like a house, working with people like attorneys and managing your grief. Make lists, keep a diary, exercise, treat yourself to something special.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. It\u2019s a rude awakening to the sordid side of humanity. Not everyone is this terrible, but some people truly are.\n\nETA: other professionals who can help you: bankers, realtors, accountants.",
