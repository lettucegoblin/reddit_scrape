God is just an excuse he uses to justify some really horrible, manipulative, controlling, dishonest and disrespectful behavior. Seriously, please tell him for me. Show him my post.\n\nHis conduct was absolutely disgusting. Made even more so by the fact that he's trying to make it look like ***you're*** the one who has the issue. Like ***you're*** the one who's being controlling and disrespectful. I rarely see, in this subreddit, such clear instance of projection, especially of this magnitude.\n\nWhy believe a single thing he says now? He's proven that he is manipulative and will lie right to your face. I have no doubt that what your daughter says is true: that he really does try to use her a baby sitter every time she gets together with her step-siblings.\n\nAnd save that video footage, and get all the proof you can.

Don't let him push his children on either of you since he sounds like a guy who would do exactly that. Your daughter refuses to help him (as she should) so he resents her for that. If he is such a man of God, why he left his first relationship in the first place and broke the family up? God frowns on that. He should fast some more and think about that.",

For some reason, he has grown resentfulness of your daughter, and doesn't see her as part of his family. He sees her as a free babysitter, whereas she sees herself as a busy stepsibling with her own responsibilities independent of his demands.\n\nShe is in no way obligated to act as free babysitter for his children, especially not when he can't respect her as an individual. You don't say how old she was when you married your husband, but some stepchildren, especially older ones, never develop a parental relationship with the step parent, and that's fine. You can't force a family bond.\n\nBut it sounds like your husband doesn't want a family bond - he wants a free, compliant babysitter, and if he doesn't get one, he's fine with her disappearing. That was a selfish and cruel thing of him to do by hiding that passport and blaming it on the will of god - which is in itself telling, because he knew all along he hid it, so in his mind he sees himself as equal to god, and his will interchangeable with god's. Don't be surprised if he discovers that his god agrees 100% with his cruel and selfish actions upon further prayer.\n\nStick to your morals here. What he did was not only wrong but purposely cruel to your daughter. It was his actions that ended up denying his children a trip, not yours.\n\nI would suggest you re-evaluate a relationship with a man who cares so little for both your daughter and you, but if you can't bring yourself to go that far, at least ask yourself why someone would do something so cruel and then hide behind a god to justify it.",

He has 3 kids from his previous relationship and I have one. She's the oldest (17). He's a dedicated man, puts God first and loves everyone.\n\n\nMy husband always complains that my daughter doesn't spend time with her stepsiblings or him but she has reasons for that and that is school, health issues and work. She does her best to spend as much time with them as she can. but she on the other hand complains that her stepdad tells her to basically take on the role of a babysitter whenever she's with her stepsiblings. My husband denied that and said that my daughter was making up excuse to not have to spend time with his kids.\n\n\nFor this issue I figured that a family trip is what the family need to get together and spend more time around each others. My husband liked the idea but said that his kids are now \"uncomfortable\" around my daughter because of her \"attitude\" and suggested we let her stay home and have the house all to herself since that's \"what she always wanted\". I told him it's best that we all go. he kept complaing til I snapped and told him to stop\n\n\nI booked (paid) for the whole family. However, my daughter told me she couldn't find her passport. We turned the house upside down looking for it but couldn't find it. My husband said maybe it was a sign from God that we should let her stay home so the trip wouldn't turn into a disaster. I ignored his comment but later while I was cleaning his office I found the passport, tucked away in the 3rd drawer under a ton of papers. I was floored by this I confronted him with it and he swore he had no idea why or how the passport got there. I checked the upstairs camera and saw him enter my daughter's room. That was it for me, I screamed my head off at him then cancelled the whole trip completely. He started arguing saying I overreacted and that he didn't want his kids to be \"miserable\" on the trip and that willing to apologize to my daughter if and when I reconsider my decision regarding the cancellation of the trip because my stepkids will be devastated but I said it was final and that it was done.\n\n\nHe become cold and distant and said that he wants to take some time to do some fasting and get guidance from God about how he should deal with the disrespect and control I had displayed lately.\n\n\nAITA for cancelling it altogether?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
