BUT, the issue got worse instead of better despite discovering and obviously putting an end to the abuse and treating with therapy. \n\nWhen it got worse after he entered his teens, we had many heated discussions about it. It essentially boiled down to him thinking it was a waste of time. He had gotten really into video games and the computer and eventually confessed he didn't wipe his ass because he didn't want to waste 30 more seconds away from his game. The smell and associated nastiness was not enough of a deterent. It took a lot of uncomfortable talks and persistence and a commando phase to finally work through the problem. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but you aren't alone.\n\nMy advice:\n\n1. Seriously consider whether sexual abuse could be a factor. You would be horrified to realize how easy it is to miss the signs when they are very young.\n2. Have an open and honest discussion about WHY he is not wiping. You will never get him to actually care about it if you can't determine why he does what he does.",

So I took her to the doctor and her pediatrician said she is constipated and the poop can't go out so it's just leaking around the poop that is clogging her up. I had to use an enema on her 1 a day for 3 days. He also said Miralax to keep her regular. That did it. No more poop on her underwear and she was going regular. She's 21 now and hasn't had that problem ever again. So maybe he's just constipated. Just take him to the doctor better safe than sorry. If its not a medical problem maybe that will embarrass him into wiping his butt better. Try wipes maybe he won't think those are gross.\nHope all goes well.",

Very pro active of you to buy the bidet. </p>\n\n<p>Also op - i would recommend doing a wash with just bleach and soap to clean out the machine. And if this problem continues i\u2019d say do this every once in a while as needed.

This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  \n\nUnfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  \n\nFirst day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  \n\nI talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. \n\nHe started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  \n\nSo I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  \n\nI don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.  \n\nHe has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  </p>\n\n<p>First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  </p>\n\n<p>I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn&#39;t know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. </p>\n\n<p>He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  </p>\n\n<p>So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it&#39;s physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I&#39;m not kinkshaming him if that&#39;s his thing.  </p>\n\n<p>He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn&#39;t because of her. I asked her.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So he no longer feels when he needs to do a poo and it isn\u2019t till it\u2019s like coming out that he realizes and goes. So he frequently has poo and poo marks in his undies. With constipation too sometimes bits leak out around the hard poo and he has no idea. \n\nBest way to manage it is so the doctor. Put him on medication so that he is regular and the poo is soft. And basically his arse is ruined now so he is going to have to manage it for life. \n\nAlso totally normal for him not to be doing anything about it. It\u2019s this strange shame cycle that they get into about it. This needs to be also managed by doctor and therapist.\n\nMy step son is 12 and he\u2019s been doing this since he was 4.
