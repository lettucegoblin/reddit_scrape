That is your time and you should be spending it however you want. If you have chosen to help your husband's friend out, they both should be grateful to you since you are doing them a favor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, if Terry needed extensive care for his injury he'd be admitted in the hospital which means he does not need assistance 24/7, which further means that he can be left unsupervised for couple of hours. \n\nTherefore, his injury should not be an excuse for you to not look after yourself when you need it the most. Everyone knows toothache is one of the most excruciating pain in the world.

If your husband really wants to &quot;take care of his friend&quot; than he should take some time off work and &quot;take care of him&quot; this is his responsibility not yours.

No girl no. Time to find a job and tell your husband that since your not getting treated with the respect and dignity that you dissevered that you no longer want to be with him and file for divorce because no this is just out of line.

He took one look at me and said that he\u2019s pulling the tooth and I\u2019m going to the hospital. I was almost admitted to the ICU because they were afraid of my tongue swelling and cutting off my ability to breathe as my neck was swollen enough that it was in line with my chin!

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\n\nSo I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.\n\nMy husband's (m37) best friend \"Terry\" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically \"tell on me\" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.\n\nLike I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.\n\nHe went to work early and I decided I was still going to go, Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice on me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he's unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.\n\nInstead of returning home I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the consequences of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>My husband&#39;s (m37) best friend &quot;Terry&quot; (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he&#39;d call my husband and basically &quot;tell on me&quot; which makes my husband mad. he says it&#39;s temporary and also since I&#39;m home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can&#39;t leave the house if my husband isn&#39;t there with his friend.</p>\n\n<p>Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can&#39;t leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn&#39;t work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.</p>\n\n<p>He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go, Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice on me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he&#39;s unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of returning home I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the consequences of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had an obsess last year, I didn&#39;t sleep for 4 days until the antibiotics finally kicked in. Then the following week a root canal done. I&#39;m terrified of dentists but I couldn&#39;t wait to see them. </p>\n\n<p>Stay with your mum, let her care for you. Your in no fit state to be doing anything, let only with two abusive men. Get yourself better before you even start to think about what you want to do. </p>\n\n<p>Hope the pain eases soon. Hugs</p>\n</div>",

With the torn ligament my dog needed a babysitter and my mom needed to drive me grocery shopping but that was it.
