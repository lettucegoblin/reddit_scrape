Please take this as the red flag it is he thinks nothing of lying manipulating and gaslighting you to get his own way - he picked her up in the first place to look the hero until it was inconvenient. This feels like classic narcissism. Please OP he's shown you who he is - don't let him charm you into staying - the second you have kids you will be trapped and miserable, or you'll get sick and he will take all the money and leave you. We see this over and over again on this sub. He's not different, he won't change, and people will not judge you badly for leaving him over this they will be as shocked as we all are.

He stole her phone so that she couldn\u2019t reach out for help. That phone was her only remaining lifeline, I  can\u2019t imagine she wouldn\u2019t have put up a fight over leaving it behind.

When confronted about his actions, he threatened to lock you out of the house rather than allow you to bring your sister back. So to him, his \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d is more important than the safety of your sister, her infant, and even you.

Your husband is not the man you thought he was, and he has shown a dangerous lack of basic human empathy and compassion. I fear for your safety if the two of you stay married. Coming to terms with this must be incredibly difficult, but I believe your well-being depends on it.",

I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.\n\n\nShe stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. My husband said it causes him stress although I suggested he out on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.\n\nLast week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find my sister or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he argued that it's his house to and he has a say but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
