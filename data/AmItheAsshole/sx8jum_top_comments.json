If you have opportunity to do a deep search of the house, you may want to take it, but at the very least get prepared to leave with little to no notice.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I made a dumb and forgot to include a judgement, so NTA</p>\n</div>",

Why didn&#39;t your own family visit you? Could he have discouraged them, maybe by minimizing the seriousness of your condition? (&quot;No big deal, she&#39;s just a little under the weather and should be fine soon.&quot;) </p>\n\n<p>Did he perhaps tell them you didn&#39;t want visitors, or you didn&#39;t want to trouble them, and he would have you call them when you felt like seeing them? Have you actually talked with your family since you left the hospital, or has everything been filtered through him?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Could he have intentionally isolated you from your own parents or siblings? We all hope you are safe.</em></strong></p>\n</div>",

You should trust your gut with this stuff. There is a reason that you don't trust him.\n\nIs it possible that he is acting in innocence? Sure. Is it possible that he is trying to get you to sign something against your will? Sure. Or is he simply using this as a test of your commitment and trust? Maybe.. which is weird and disingenuous in itself.\n\nThe important part is that you discovered a feeling about him that you didn't know was there. You discovered that you don't trust him.

I would stop in whenever I could but generally I was just there to help with big decisions and she handled the daily management. \n\nOne day, a couple years later, shit would hit the fan and my life changed completely thanks to a call from the CRA (Canada\u2019s version of the IRS). \n\nTurns out my sweet, incredibly caring and loving wife had done some gone to some pretty incredible lengths to deceive me and hide the fact that our business was failing badly. \n\nOne of them was going into my contacts and block our accountant from both phone and email. She did the same with our (business\u2019) landlord so he couldn\u2019t reach me. \n\nShe had all of our mail rerouted to her email (paperless) so that I would never see any statements. \n\nA number of other things all in an effort to make it impossible for me to discover what the true state of our business was. \n\nThe result was that we got in a lot of money trouble with a lot of our suppliers, and the CRA, and even a couple employees who never got paid - that one upset me the most. \n\nMy wife is a wonderful person. You don\u2019t know her, but I do. And I am telling you from the bottom of my soul I know she did this because she was scared and didn\u2019t want to hurt or disappoint me. There was no malice here. Not an ounce. She doesn\u2019t have it in her. \n\nSome people I\u2019ve talked to over the years told me I should\u2019ve divorced her or sued her (I lost my house over the deal - I owned it before we were married and we borrowed against it to open the business) or both. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at here, OP, is that you are clearly NTA but you have every right to be suspicious\u2026 but I urge you to have a conversation with your husband. \n\nIs there a chance that your medical bills put you in financial trouble and he\u2019s trying to get you to sign a second mortgage on your home or something like that? \n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s cool that he\u2019s deceiving you (if that\u2019s the case) but I\u2019m trying to offer a third option to all of the people in here accusing your husband of awful things\u2026. There is another option, and that is that he\u2019s deceiving you but with the best possible intentions - as hard as that may be for strangers on Reddit to understand. \n\nAnyway NTA. But talk to your husband. Challenge him\u2026 make him be honest with you. I did that with my wife. When she looked me in the eyes and lied, I knew instantly. \n\nHe\u2019s your husband, you\u2019ll know.",
