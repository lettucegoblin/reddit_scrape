I'm not entirely sure what their reasons were but it happened. \n\nThe only thing that came up was at the reception, where the bride's father said the groom hadn't asked his permission to use \"his\" name. This was half joking and half serious to put the groom on the back foot (its quite a common wedding practice among Maori & Pacific Island families here in New Zealand to intimidate the groom in some manner. Usually its a brother of the bride saying\"you better look after my sister or else\", but in this case they used the name change as an issue).\n\nI also saw a current affairs story in the 1990s where a man took his wife's surname and complained to the Births, Deaths & Marriages office that his son's birth certificate didn't have a field for his \"maiden\" name. He was concerned that future genealogists may hit a brick wall with him.\n\nFurther unconventional anecdotes that may be relevant: I know of several brothers who are in fact all half-brothers because of their mother's multiple partners. However, the father of the youngest son raised all of them and they all consider him their father. Every one of them have changed their surname legally to his name prior to getting married.\n\nSo your situation may be more common than you think. You have presented solid reasons, but in reality it could just be your preference and be equally as valid.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.\n\nEdit: A couple more!\n\nI worked with a guy whose parents divorced and his Dad was not around much. He struggled with their relationship and ultimately changed his name to his Mum's maiden name.\n\nAlso, my sister-in-law's aunt married a Mr Crapper. Their son changed his name to his mother's maiden name. And I don't blame him!",
