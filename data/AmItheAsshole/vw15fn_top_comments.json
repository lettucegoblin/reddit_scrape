Isn\u2019t that the argument that she\u2019s using to disallow cuddling with your homosexual son? </p>\n\n<p>First of all, gross @ your wife for suggesting that you or your son are somehow attracted to each other and incestuous. That\u2019s essentially what she\u2019s saying.  If she disagrees, she\u2019s flat about admitting she\u2019s homophobic.  </p>\n\n<p>Second of all, gross @ your wife for thinking your son is somehow less worthy of parental love and comfort based on his orientation.  </p>\n\n<p>She needs therapy and to apologize to you.  She also needs to stay in her own lane when it comes to your boys.</p>\n</div>",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect her to immediately move on like nothing happened after your son came out. It is a change that many people have to get used to for various reasons. Would you prefer it if she completely ignored it or if she pretended not to care while harbouring these thoughts inside? \n\nIf she was rejecting him I think your reaction would be warranted but her concerns appear to stem from ignorance. This could be an opportunity for you & her to openly discuss your feelings about this change as well as to suggest some educational resources for her to make use of.  \n \nPersonally, I find the hugging & kissing odd because the boys are 20yrs old now, not because one is gay. \nHowever, since you & your sons are comfortable with it, feel free.",

There was a rumor of a female teacher dating a student when I was in high school never really found out do it was true or not. We did have a girl get pregnant by a teacher, conveniently after highschool, and I\u2019ve been hit on by 5 male teachers while in high school, and 1 substitute teacher. One actually came to my house on a teacher work day. He called asking where my parents were at first. I\u2019m a naive kid. I\u2019m like work duh. He asked me what I was doing. Cleaning the bathroom, before my mom kills me. He said he\u2019s coming over open the garage. Why? He hung up. I called my best friend to get there asap. She cursed him out and called him disgusting. He left. I had 2 male teachers contact me after I graduated. One actually asked me to have a foursome with his two other roommates. One roommate was also a teacher at my high school. I noped right out of that situation. He pretended to be my friend and give me advice, but he really wanted to bone me. Ive had numerous college professors hit on me. One, I actually thought we were friends (naive college student). Until he tried to kiss me, and I was like dude no. Then he went all crazy on me. Scared the bejeezus outta me. Lots of male teachers ended up dating students officially after they graduated. Obviously it didn\u2019t last, and he\u2019d move on to his next prey. Some of the professors did the same thing. I live in a big city. My freshman class was 1,300 students in high school. I lived in an upper middle class neighborhood. Just added for context, because it\u2019s assumed that most LSES children are the most abused. Also, I never told my parents. None of us did. The truth is there are way more stories than actually gets reported. Women predators make the best headline stories. They all suck though in my opinion. I\u2019m terrified to let my kids go to school whenever hubby and I finally have them. I\u2019m seriously thinking about home school. I\u2019ll just have to be a heavily involved parent which scares me too. How do you keep your children safe from predators? My parents did everything, and it didn\u2019t help.",
