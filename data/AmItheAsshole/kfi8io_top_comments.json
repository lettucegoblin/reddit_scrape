Your current husband has enabled his son with his addiction.  Ask yourself how and read the post.\n2. He states he loves you but he married you because you had things he didn't have.\n3. His son stole from you, and you didn't press charges.  Your spouse talked you out of it.  He's talked you out of over 7,500 dollars if not the whole 13,000 to try and save his son.\n4. This isn't about you, it's not about your daughter it's about your husband and his golden child son that has an addiction problem. \"THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM\"\n5. You've become an ATM for him and his son.\n6. Your husband is feeling entitled to your daughter's education fund that you will have to pay taxes on if it doesn't go to her college (yup that's right)\n7. Your daughter has seen her lifestyle altered by the man you married and his son, she knows she will never be first while you are married to this man, it's all about his son.\n8. One of you should have health insurance for everyone in the family as you talk about a college fund that means you are in the US.

I have to ask you this, if he is more about his 24 year old loser addicted son, (yes I said it) and won't cut him off after all he did.  That should be enough to tell you that he doesn't care about you and your daughter or her future.  He's prioritizing his bio son over his stepdaughter.\n\nBetter yet, the college fund doesn't have a dime he contributed to it, whereas your late husband, you, and his family did.  It's not about helping his son, this is about him guilting you into taking your daughter's college money for his son because he doesn't have anything left.\n\nHe will never prioritize your relationship and really hasn't since you married him, you have done so much to help him and his son that he thinks you should keep on giving.  This is a one-sided relationship where you are concerned.  You have been conned and will keep getting conned until you no longer have a house over your head because of this man's son.",

I put my family through hell. In my OPINION addiction is a CHOICE. Not a disease. Step son chose to get high. He chose to continue doing it then it got to the point he was choosing to keep getting high so he would not have to withdraw. Choices. The best thing my very loving family ever did for me during my battle was to completly cut me off and love me from a distance. They were enabling me. They thought they were helping me by feeding me giving me a place to sleep etc but they werent. When i say that i could not even get a bologna sandwich out of them i mean that. I went to jail and to prison i got no money no letters no phone calls home no visits. They were done. They by the tough love helped save my life. It was hard for them to do it but in the end best choice they ever made. I went to a free in house rehab for 6 months. Completed the program in feb 2018 and have been clean and sober ever since. Its hard. I wake up everyday and CHOOSE not to get high. Hes got to want it for himself  Want sobriety more than breath. Or else its not gonna work for long. Im sorry yall having to go through this.",

You have contributed significantly to stepson\u2019s recovery but stepson made no effort. This does mean that you shouldn\u2019t continue to contribute until you see him making his own efforts. \n3.  I\u2019m no expert in addiction but have many friends who have taken various approaches: cold turkey, NA, jail time, rehab, chemical substitutes, and the morgue. The one common thread for recovery is hitting \u201crock bottom\u201d. Sadly, stepson hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom yet and till he does, the road is still down hill. He has to be ready to participate in his own healing, or his free agency has to be taken away. (Jail). \n3. He\u2019s already stolen to support his addiction. He\u2019s shown no individual volition. Hubby is desperate (understandably so) and is grasping at straws to avoid the reality that his son isn\u2019t ready yet. Hubby thinks that the more expensive program will do the trick. However, stepson has already qualified himself for the free state supported option (jail).\n3. Hubby needs to go to some NA meetings and learn from the people there about recovery. Thing is, you don\u2019t recover because you had help. You recover because you helped yourself. \n3. Stepson needs to experience the consequences of his actions. Jail is a much better consequence than death. You and hubby are always there to help him climb the hill on the other side but he has to reach the bottom first. \n3. Go to some NA meetings and ask the people there what they think a good recovery pathway would be; my feeling is that they will suggest jail could be a good thing. \n3. I\u2019m sure that no matter how good natured your daughter is, a part of her will resent the fact that your marriage and someone else\u2019s bad choices negatively affect her future. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be negatively impacted by someone else\u2019s addiction problems. I think she should be fully aware of the issue though so she has an example of what not to do. \n3. He\u2019s not your son. Frankly, legally he\u2019s not even your stepson and never was, he was a full adult when you and hubby got married. He has a Mom, a Dad, and you are essentially an interested stranger. You do NOT have any legal obligation to help him, and beyond being kind (you have done more than that) you have no moral obligation either. \n4. You said it yourself: your daughter\u2019s college money was given with strings attached; it\u2019s for her college. Nothing else. IF your daughter has some left over and would like to dedicate some of it to her step father\u2019s son\u2019s rehab, I would let her, but use it for its intended purpose. You have a few valid excuses here: Departed man\u2019s wishes, dedicated funds, in effect you are a trustee of this money and your daughter is the beneficiary, you are not morally (perhaps not even legally) allowed to use the money for other purposes. \n3. Hubby might think you are TA, but you\u2019re not. If he gets all bent out of shape, remember it\u2019s because he\u2019s desperate. Send him to support groups like NA (you don\u2019t have to be an addict to attend NA meetings, I have and consider it a good experience).",

You said it yourself: your daughter\u2019s college money was given with strings attached; it\u2019s for her college. Nothing else. IF your daughter has some left over and would like to dedicate some of it to her step father\u2019s son\u2019s rehab, I would let her, but use it for its intended purpose. You have a few valid excuses here: Departed man\u2019s wishes, dedicated funds, in effect you are a trustee of this money and your daughter is the beneficiary, you are not morally (perhaps not even legally) allowed to use the money for other purposes. \n3. Hubby might think you are TA, but you\u2019re not. If he gets all bent out of shape, remember it\u2019s because he\u2019s desperate. Send him to support groups like NA (you don\u2019t have to be an addict to attend NA meetings, I have and consider it a good experience).</p>\n</div>",

He's already resorted to stealing, lying, etc for years? now, and you two have dumped 13k into programs so far that haven't made a dent. Heroin is a league of its own, and while a few people really do stay clean of it, unfortunately that number is low compared to a lot of other drug addiction recoveries. My boyfriend's mom died when he was 15 of opioid usage complications, and his sister struggled with a heroin addiction for a decade - was in and out of various rehab and halfway homes and sometimes would even be clean up to a year - before dying at 26 from an OD.\n\nNow, I understand that everyone is different, and maybe your  stepson will be different, maybe an inpatient program will do the trick. But DO NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, let your husband try and help at the expense of you or your daughter. The hard truth is it's not worth going into a bunch of a debt or taking away from a healthy person to try and save someone who's already taken so much from you. If y'all keep bailing your stepson out, he won't learn.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit to add: My BF's sister was a great person with a huge problem, and at the end of the day, the addiction came first cause it had to. She swindled 1000s of dollars from their grandparents before they passed, and it got to a point my bf had to stop telling her where he lived when he moved because she would either just try and hit him up for money or steal from him when she visited.

My last interaction was in my 30's. I wanted to move past the hurt and pain to forgive him. It all ended with me going into a rage when he spoke badly about my grandmother and mom who took care of us as he hopped from woman to woman and raised someone else's child. He then proceeded to tell me the next day that he was tempted to use because of my infamous temper and he had to contact his sponsor because of me. The last conversation we had he stopped talking to me because I refused to participate in a family picture. \n\nAs long as I was agreeable and acted as his therapist he was happier than a fly in shit. As soon as I told him about himself and how he has effected me I was the devil incarnate. \n\nReading just this small portion is making me tear up because I have so much unresolved anger and hurt that I have to deal with everyday. \n\nYou have done more than you needed to, there is no reason to feel any guilt about leaving this mess behind.\n\nI would beg you to get out of this situation before your daughter becomes a victim of their selfish self-serving behavior.",

End of story.\n\nThat said, I understand your husbands position. He\u2019s terrified his child is going to die. Imagine thinking\u2014truly knowing, in your heart\u2014that you\u2019re going to outlive your kid. That your child will die, soon. You would do *anything* to help him. Anything. So I get why your husband is upset\u2014he probably feels like you don\u2019t care what happens to his child. It\u2019s not fair, and obviously untrue, but that\u2019s probably how he feels.\n\nI want to add here that no matter what you decide, his sobriety is up to him. Shelling out 30k for rehab is NOT a guarantee that he\u2019ll get or even stay clean. Addicts don\u2019t have a conscience when they\u2019re in active addiction. If he wants to leave, he\u2019s not going to consider the fact that you spent 30k. He\u2019ll leave, and he will use. \n\nThis is a really difficult situation, and I am truly so sorry your family is dealing with this. Heroin addiction is awful. I can tell you suboxone saved my life. Maybe you can try to find an outpatient doc that prescribes it and see if you can get him treatment that way? Yes, he\u2019ll still \u201cbe on opiates.\u201d But it gives your brain time to heal and blocks the effects of other opiates, so he\u2019ll have zero reason to use. It\u2019ll also let his body and mind heal from the heroin over time. Think on it.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many addicts in this thread offering words of wisdom, but if there is anything you need\u2014even just to talk\u2014my DMs are open. I truly, with all of my heart, hope you guys all get through this intact. <3",

If she was say 8 years old, then there is plenty of time to recoup $30,000, but she\u2019s going to college (hopefully) in 3 years. Does your husband make enough money to pay her back $10,000 a year? \n\nNow this part may be rude to some folks, but hear me out. \n\nMy entire childhood I watched my grandparents at at for my mothers rehabs, she was stealing from them, conning them, the works. \n\nIt\u2019s not a medical need like someone getting hurt and staying in a hospital. Even though it\u2019s a disease... he chose it in the first place, so now he needs to make the choice to solve it. Saying \u201cI\u2019ll go to rehab, but you\u2019ll pay for it\u201d is not him taking responsibility for his recovery, which all the previous fails and relapses show. (This isnt to say the rehab wouldn\u2019t help, because this could be THE time, but do you really want to bet $30,000 on a losing horse?)\n\nThe fact that your husband told your stepson about that money is a huge problem too, it\u2019s not your husbands or your stepsons money, it\u2019s none of their business. I would move that securely to a bank that you and your husband do not share and make sure he cannot access it under ANY circumstances (even consider setting up a trust.) You can tell your husband it\u2019s being moved, but I wouldn\u2019t tell him where, again... none of his business. \n\nWhile being supportive can help, at some point you need to stop. Being supportive of a drug addict who doesn\u2019t want to get clean (truly) is enabling that behavior. You\u2019re right, he could die from an overdose without help, but he also can die from one with all your help. \n\nNow my last suggestion, is to be frank with your husband. Be honest with him, but also care for his pain. There\u2019s part of him saying if he doesn\u2019t help his son, he\u2019s as good as dead so he feels he has a personal responsibility in his sons recovery. That\u2019s just not true. His son is playing him like fiddle and the rehab attempts could very well have been a ploy to get more sympathy  (my own mother pretended to have cancer, moved in my my grandparents, and had them running around as her servants while she stole and used behind their backs)\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t need to go into the abuse your daughter is receiving from this whole situation, others have commented, and YOU should know that it\u2019s not ok to make a 15 year old girl feel guilty about an ADULT (stepson) making bad choices with their own life.",

By the grace of god and having an unbelievable support group i was able to finally kick that habit once and for all. I am now 8 1/2 years clean and soo happy to feel life again. So back to your stepson.  He will not get clean when your husband is constantly picking him up when he falls, he has to hit rock bottom first and really feel the pain of addiction before he truly starts to want to get clean. Im all for getting loved ones into programs when they become addicted to drugs, but when they constantly fail and relapse and it is costing the family lots of money at some point the families have to realize they are just enabling them. It takes alot of hard work to get clean but it takes alot more work and dedication to stay clean. This is going to unfortunately be a huge issue in your family until your husband has finally had enough and cuts his son off. And for your husband to even bring this up to your young daughter and guilt her like that is completely out of line. He is way beyond wrong for doing that, your daughter's college/life fund is strictly for her and her future. I wish i had a simple answer for you that would remedy your situation but unfortunately i don't. I just hope that you are able to stay strong and stick to your guns and not give in. You sound like a strong independent woman who will be strong and stick to your decision. Don't let your husband or stepson guilt you or your daughter into anything, this is on him and his son. Every day i struggle with this demon and i take life one day at a time. Today i choose not to use, but who knows what tomorrow will bring, and i dont worry about tomorrow till tomorrow comes. And as for yesterday and the past i can't change any of it so i no longer dwell on those things. I fight this battle daily there is no cure all for addiction, it takes tons and tons of constant work and self reflection to be successful. Stay strong and i hope and pray that this situation you are facing with your husband does not ruin your marriage beyond repair. Good luck.",

Im all for getting loved ones into programs when they become addicted to drugs, but when they constantly fail and relapse and it is costing the family lots of money at some point the families have to realize they are just enabling them. It takes alot of hard work to get clean but it takes alot more work and dedication to stay clean. This is going to unfortunately be a huge issue in your family until your husband has finally had enough and cuts his son off. And for your husband to even bring this up to your young daughter and guilt her like that is completely out of line. He is way beyond wrong for doing that, your daughter&#39;s college/life fund is strictly for her and her future. I wish i had a simple answer for you that would remedy your situation but unfortunately i don&#39;t. I just hope that you are able to stay strong and stick to your guns and not give in. You sound like a strong independent woman who will be strong and stick to your decision. Don&#39;t let your husband or stepson guilt you or your daughter into anything, this is on him and his son. Every day i struggle with this demon and i take life one day at a time. Today i choose not to use, but who knows what tomorrow will bring, and i dont worry about tomorrow till tomorrow comes. And as for yesterday and the past i can&#39;t change any of it so i no longer dwell on those things. I fight this battle daily there is no cure all for addiction, it takes tons and tons of constant work and self reflection to be successful. Stay strong and i hope and pray that this situation you are facing with your husband does not ruin your marriage beyond repair. Good luck.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "NTA. My best friend was addicted to alcohol and cocaine, which was exacerbated by having bipolar disorder. She constantly relapsed when she had a manic episode. On top of that, she had epilepsy due to cavernoma developing on her brain and both alcohol/cocaine were triggers for seizures.\n\nShe was incredibly successful from a young age. Graduated high school at 16 and college at 19, ended up being one level below C-suite before she was 30 at a Fortune 100 company and made $500K per year. Despite that, she stole money from me and constantly borrowed money from her parents. Before I realized she was an addict, she would secretly drink from our well-stocked bar. One week, I realized she killed 20 bottles of alcohol while I was on a work trip. She ended up being fired and asked her step-father for a $75K loan within 6 months because she was draining her finances spending money on alcohol and drugs. BPD made things worse because she would go on crazy spending sprees when manic. I hosted multiple interventions, tried to get her into rehab multiple times - she would agree then bail, and finally asked her parents to come and take her back to her hometown because I couldn't keep an eye on her since I traveled for work so much. I was terrified that she would have a seizure and fall down the stairs or that she would overdose while I was gone. \n\nIn the end, it didn't work because ultimately, she needed to be the one who decided to get better. She never hit her rock bottom before she abused drugs and alcohol so much it ended up inducing a massive seizure that killed her. I was wracked with guilt for years and only recently have I realized that I was probably enabling her for years. She always knew I would be there for her no matter how horribly she behaved, so she never took the interventions seriously since she knew I wouldn't leave. I was angry with her parents for kicking her out for not following their rules, but now I realize that to allow her to stay in their home when she had agreed but then refused to quit alcohol and cocaine would have been enabling behavior as well. \n\nEnabling is not helpful and just allows addicts to go longer without hitting rock bottom or realizing they need/want to kick the addiction. Addicts need to find internal motivation for change, otherwise it will never hold for long. They need to want to get better. No amount of rehab or money spent will work until they decide they want to stop being an addict. You can't force people to get better. The dark side to this is that addicts may overdose or die before hitting their rock bottom/realizing they want to get better. If this happens, there isn't much that you as someone on the outside could have done to prevent it in the long run. Most addicts have to hit rock bottom to realize they want to get better but for some, their rock bottom is just too far away.\n\nAll of this is to say that it doesn't feel like to your stepson is ready and wants to get better yet. Just because the rehab is more expensive doesn't mean that it will be more effective. On top of that, for heroin, rehab is statistically unsuccessful. Being in a highly controlled and unrealistic setting may provide good outcomes during rehab but doesn't translate to the real world afterwards. There is a high incidence of relapse. Realistically, his shot at recovery is going to be better at a methadone clinic.\n\nThere is zero reason why your 15 year old child should feel responsible for any attempts to cure her adult step-brother of his addiction. A) It probably will not work. B) There is no reason to spend that kind of money. Expensive rehab guarantees nothing. C) She is a child and should not bear this weight and responsibility. D) He needs to take personal responsibility, otherwise he will never get better. Former addicts will tell you time and time again that they only got better after they decided they wanted to or that they were tired of not having family and friends around. It sounds harsh, but it's true. People in active addiction are selfish and only think about themselves. Your loving support may do nothing but missing that loving support may shock him into action. I know it sounds horrible and unimaginable as a parent, but if the effort comes from anyone other than himself, it probably won't work. \n\nPlease take steps to protect your daughter. It would probably be helpful to see a therapist. There is nothing she could do to help him because he has to help himself. And please make sure that money is secured for her future, whether via a trust or a 529 plan (or ESA/Education IRA if you qualify).",

If he doesn't have insurance he can get on welfare and they'll send him somewhere.

There&#39;s plenty of options out there besides paying out of pocket. Call his insurance they&#39;ll give you options on where he can go. If he doesn&#39;t have insurance he can get on welfare and they&#39;ll send him somewhere. But welfare may take a while so theres are places your city or county will pay for and that&#39;ll be faster than him getting on welfare. In my city it&#39;s called community behavioral health or CBH. Im sure where you live has a similar organization. Message me if you want more info.</p>\n</div>",

He only wants to go to these places to stop the inevitable which is jail, institutions or death. At the rate he is going he s gonna kill himself. I know this personally because iv been there.\n\n Your husband is sick too and your not far off. When addicts and alcoholic s are around people who do not use they make them sick mentally.. Your husband is the one enabling and being selfish.. he s only trying to help his son for his own personal reasons.. You both cannot save your stepson. He needs to hit rock bottom and want to do this for himself.  Love him from a distance but he needs to move out and figure this shit out on his own. No more 60k rehabs it won't work until he is ready to get sober. And im sorry but it doesn't sound like he is. I hope he is but reality is pretty obvious sometimes.  \n\nThe BEST thing you can do for you and your daughter is 1. Move 2. Stop the enabling 3.get some therapy or go to alanon. And if you don't want to do any of that change the locks and STOP helping him. \n\nWhen I tried my last rehab it was like the 10th one at that time I had finally got arrested and spent 2.5 years in prison.

But my parents did the tough love thing I was never allowed in the house by myself and I pretty much was homeless for a year before prison. I will never forget those years and how I got to where I am. I can only say that I beyond grateful that my parents loved me from a distance and took the chance that I would hit bottom before death.

I spent 60 days in rehab last year then went into sober living, but I was using again less than a month after I got out. I tried outpatient, but that didn't work at first either. I finally got into a Suboxone program that has changed my life. Not sure if you've heard of Suboxone, but it's worth checking out for your stepson. \n\nAnyways, my point is that no matter how much money you spend for him to get clean, NOTHING will work until he's 100% ready. I know it's hard, but you need to protect your daughter. Addiction is fckn brutal, especially a heroin addiction. At some point you just have to accept that what happens to your stepson is out of your control. It's unfortunate, but that's reality. He's the only one that can save himself. Inpatient definitely made a big difference in my recovery, but it didn't help right away. Does your stepson have insurance?? My insurance covered my 60 days in rehab and I know not everyone is that fortunate, but you should definitely look into it. It's unfair of your husband to put this on you and your daughter, but understand that he is terrified he's going to lose his son. He's not thinking clearly right now. I'm sorry your family is in this situation. I recommend you guys check out some Nar-Anon meetings, which are just like NA meetings but for the family of the addict.

Most addicts don\u2019t have $30K by the time they\u2019re ready for help, so why is that the only option in the dads mind?\n\nMAT is the only thing that helped me after a 10year addiction. 2 suboxone/subutex attempts, multiple withdrawals while crying in my bed, and I didn\u2019t stop until February 2020 because I finally decided to get into a methadone program. I had to decide that hassling myself every day and getting there was more important than chasing the high. And it works when you decide to work for it.\n\nI hope OP\u2019s stepson gets the help he needs, truly, but if the dad is the one pushing it and saying that this is the only thing that will work, well, doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s the son trying that hard. A couple of suboxone strips, some Benadryl, NA meetings, and your own bed at home is the same damn experience except for being locked in - but if you choose to leave they can\u2019t stop you at rehab, either.",

Most addicts don\u2019t have $30K by the time they\u2019re ready for help, so why is that the only option in the dads mind?</p>\n\n<p>MAT is the only thing that helped me after a 10year addiction. 2 suboxone/subutex attempts, multiple withdrawals while crying in my bed, and I didn\u2019t stop until February 2020 because I finally decided to get into a methadone program.

He is 24 and if he has no job or income because obviously he's an addict, he should apply for state-funded insurance and that will cover detox and rehab for free. I know because I am on State insurance and every time I have gone in it has been covered. I wouldn't want my family to waste money on me because I am going to be an addict for a long time still, and if he has stolen from you and disrespected both you and your husband and daughter that is disgusting and wrong. Needing a fix/preventing withdrawls (which feel like you are dying, i do sympathize with that) is an excuse for stealing your stuff because I for one have never stolen anything to keep my addiction up, that is a personal choice some addicts make. \n\nOverall, if he is not ready to quit he will continue to use and anything you spend on him will be a waste of money. It is extremely sad but sometimes you have to have no contact with the active addict to show them they have reached rock bottom and no support from family until they decide or choose to get sober. It will be ugly and messy and probably filled with tears but he needs to let go of his son to save his life. If he gives him a choice of get clean or never talk to him again, I will say it could end badly with a suicide.

I watched it and felt it my entire life. I\u2019m still afraid when people touch my stuff because I just know they\u2019ll take it.

Probably a better one. But come on lady, please, done let your kid be on AITA one day and feel angry and targeted by a Reddit comment that is legitimately correct in its reasoning. I wish all the health and happiness for your stepson, I do. I miss my brother dearly. I get it. And yet still, protect your girl.",

And dealt with it completely alone because I didn\u2019t want to saddle my parents with anymore baggage or bring in my friends in past a mention because I knew. I was a burden. I watched it and felt it my entire life. I\u2019m still afraid when people touch my stuff because I just know they\u2019ll take it. My first serious, adult relationship was with a fucking coke addict and I moved in with him because I <em>couldn\u2019t even tell</em> how fucked up he was because I was used to people being much, much worse.</p>\n\n<p>OP was a different kind of mom than mine was. Probably a better one. But come on lady, please, done let your kid be on AITA one day and feel angry and targeted by a Reddit comment that is legitimately correct in its reasoning. I wish all the health and happiness for your stepson, I do. I miss my brother dearly. I get it. And yet still, protect your girl.</p>\n</div>",

She will internalize this feeling and it\u2019s very likely that it will cause her to spend her life trying to quell the guilt by being overly generous to a lot more people, without the ability to see when she is being taken advantage of. She will feel the need to take care of everyone. She will feel guilty for not being able to do so. It could cripple her emotionally. 15 is a very impressionable age. If you haven\u2019t already, sit her down and talk about addiction with her. Read those books recommended and please go to Alanon. This will fundamentally change your daughter. Please do something about it.\n\nEditing to add: talk to her about what addiction is, how it works in the brain/body, the options people have to recover, the ups and downs of the recovery process and that recovery doesn\u2019t always happen. Talk to her about how helping doesn\u2019t always equal positive outcomes and it\u2019s very possible for her generosity to not pay off. Knowledge is power. Talk to her about how addiction is extremely personal in the sense that no one can fix it for the addict except the addict and that their the actions or consequences are never her fault, no matter what. Tell her that while it is important to help family, it is equally important to take care of yourself and at the end of the day, nothing is going to work unless the addict is ready for it to. Tell her she is still very young, too young to bare this responsibility and that taking on this burden is one that can only be done if you fully understand the possible consequences for both herself and the addict and how she will feel when they happen and she doesn\u2019t yet have the life experience that would allow her to responsibly take it on. My advice is to keep the convo framed generally rather than focused on her stepbrother because she will be faced with these kinds of decisions throughout her life. Absolutely include him in the convo but remind her that it\u2019s not just about him and that this is something that will affect how she deals with these situations for the rest of her life.\n\nEditing again to say: the goal here should be for you to give her enough information that she is able to come to the conclusion that her gut instinct to not help is okay and in this situation is the right thing to do, for her and for her stepbrother. And that in the future she may want to make a different decision, and that\u2019s okay too. In the event that his addiction leads to, and I\u2019m sorry to be blunt, serious medical issues or even death, she will see the effect it has on her stepfather, you, anyone connected to him and the fall out that happens and could feel that she made the wrong choice or that she was pressured into making the wrong choice by you. This is a life-lesson teaching moment, use it wisely. As his addiction continues to unfold, continue to talk about all of this. Honor and validate any feeling she has about it but then encourage her to think about everything you taught her. Always relate it to her stepbrother and tough decisions in general. \n\nMy apologies for all the edits. I am writing this as it unfolds in my brain. I\u2019ve been that daughter all my life except the addicts are my parents so I feel the need to help particularly heavy in my heart. \n\nI\u2019m wishing you all the best and rooting for stepbrothers recovery.",

And many people, especially those not well versed in addiction, stop there. Obviously getting him into rehab is best, after all.\n\nUnfortunately it ends up being enabling if you don't include consequences for failure, like OP's husband. Addicts are sick and need help, but they're also responsible for their own behavior and choices. It can definitely be a fine line, but ultimately it means that unless they choose change, they won't change. They have to want it, and in many cases much more than feeling like sobriety would be cool. They often have to look at themselves and say \"look what I've done to myself and my loved ones. I want to be different more than anything.\"\n\nTaking away the addict's ability to see how their behavior is negatively affecting their relationships is stealing from them one of the most valuable tools they can have in recovery.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A lot of people confuse support and enabling. At first glance, doing whatever is necessary to get him into rehab, no matter the cost, looks supportive. And many people, especially those not well versed in addiction, stop there. Obviously getting him into rehab is best, after all.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it ends up being enabling if you don&#39;t include consequences for failure, like OP&#39;s husband. Addicts are sick and need help, but they&#39;re also responsible for their own behavior and choices. It can definitely be a fine line, but ultimately it means that unless they choose change, they won&#39;t change. They have to want it, and in many cases much more than feeling like sobriety would be cool. They often have to look at themselves and say &quot;look what I&#39;ve done to myself and my loved ones. I want to be different more than anything.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Taking away the addict&#39;s ability to see how their behavior is negatively affecting their relationships is stealing from them one of the most valuable tools they can have in recovery. It&#39;s enabling. And it&#39;s shitty for everyone involved but you just gotta do what you gotta do.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for ranting at you, it&#39;s not even directed at you.

        "body": "This is what I was looking for! \n\nWhen it comes to addiction it is in many ways the same as with mental health. You can\u2019t save anyone else and you can\u2019t force them to become well. \n\nWhether you are suffering from severe depression and is suicidal/self harming or from drug addiction no one else can fix it for you and no one else can stop you from doing what you want to do. \n\n**TW: self harm/Suicidal tendencies**   \nSo I have severe mental health issues. When I was a teenager I had not yet been diagnosed and thus was not reviving the correct treatment, so I was extremely sick. I was severely suicidal and self harming. I also had full access to sharp objects. My mother spoke to me about it, she explained that she wouldn\u2019t try to take away my scissors or sewing needles or my razors or anything. Not because she didn\u2019t care or because she didn\u2019t want to stop me, but simply because she knew that she could never stop me. If I decided to hurt myself I would, I would find a way. So taking things away would do nothing except for unnecessarily limiting me. And she was absolutely correct. Taking away the sharp objects I used for my hobby or my shaving razor would not have stopped me. She could never hav predicted everything I could have used to cause myself harm and trying could have been worse because it could have resulted in me resorting to more harmful solutions. \n\nI did stop eventually. I stopped when I got the help I needed. I stopped because *I* wanted to, not because anyone made me. The treatment didn\u2019t work because of the treatment, because it was the correct treatment or because it was so successful. Though it was. It worked because I wanted it. Because I wanted to do it so I put in the effort and the work to *make it work*. It wasn\u2019t easy, it never is. \n\nIt\u2019s like with meds, whatever they are. They will not and can not ever work if the patient won\u2019t take them. You can have the best painkillers in the world and they won\u2019t ever help if you never actually take them. It\u2019s not enough to go to a doctor and get a prescription and go to them pharmacy and buy them and take them home and put them in the medicine cabinet. You, yourself have to go to the medicine cabinet and take them out and swallow one when you need tut in order for them to actually help ease your pain. \n\nMy migraine medicine does absolutely nothing to help me if I don\u2019t actually take it when I have a migraine. I said I wanted help. I went to the doctor, I got diagnosed with migraine, I got migraine medication prescribed, I went to the pharmacy and bought them, I took them home and put them in my medicine cabinet. They still don\u2019t work because that\u2019s not enough. I have to remember that I have them and use the tools I have been given myself for it to actually make any difference. If I don\u2019t make the effort of going to get them and taking one when I have migraines it will never work. Never ever make any difference. \n\nIt\u2019s not the rehab that fails. It\u2019s the patient. The  treatment provides him with tools, it\u2019s up to him to actually use those tools when he needs them. It doesn\u2019t work because every time he feels the urge he gets to chose. The easy way or the hard way? Succumb to the urge or use the tools he has been provided and suffer through it. \n\nI wasn\u2019t cured. I am addicted to cutting myself. And I am severely suicidal and just want to die. Every time life gets extra hard I want to die. When I\u2019m hurting I want to die and I want to hurt myself. It\u2019s an addiction, I feel the need, the want strongly. And every time I have a choice to make. Use the tools that I have been given to suffer though it it or just take the easy path and give in. And it is hard to choose not to, it is very hard and it takes a lot of effort and energy and will power. But I have been wanting to kill myself for over 20 years and I have not even attempted to do so for around ten to fifteen years despite that being what I want more than anything else. Because I choose to live. I choose to not give up. I make that choice every time I get pushed to the edge, over and over and over. When my heart is shattering and pieces of my broken heart is cutting me up inside and it is so painful that I can\u2019t even breath, I chose wether I will cut to instantly stop the feeling or use my tools to get through it and feel it all until it\u2019s over. When I falter it is because I made the wrong choice. Someone else may have hurt me and pushed me to that place where I have to choose. Their behavior/treatment towards/off me is their responsibility, my self harm is solely mine. They made me hurt but they never made me cut, I did that, I chose that. It stops when I want it to. When I choose to. I don\u2019t *have to* cut when I\u2019m hurting, not even when it\u2019s unbearable, intolerable, I have other options. It\u2019s just easier, quicker. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have to with stand it if I do. Less work, effort, energy. Like fast food. I don\u2019t *have to* eat unhealthy fast food if I\u2019m hungry. It\u2019s just easier.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is what I was looking for! </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to addiction it is in many ways the same as with mental health. You can\u2019t save anyone else and you can\u2019t force them to become well. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you are suffering from severe depression and is suicidal/self harming or from drug addiction no one else can fix it for you and no one else can stop you from doing what you want to do. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TW: self harm/Suicidal tendencies</strong><br/>\nSo I have severe mental health issues. When I was a teenager I had not yet been diagnosed and thus was not reviving the correct treatment, so I was extremely sick. I was severely suicidal and self harming. I also had full access to sharp objects. My mother spoke to me about it, she explained that she wouldn\u2019t try to take away my scissors or sewing needles or my razors or anything. Not because she didn\u2019t care or because she didn\u2019t want to stop me, but simply because she knew that she could never stop me. If I decided to hurt myself I would, I would find a way. So taking things away would do nothing except for unnecessarily limiting me. And she was absolutely correct. Taking away the sharp objects I used for my hobby or my shaving razor would not have stopped me. She could never hav predicted everything I could have used to cause myself harm and trying could have been worse because it could have resulted in me resorting to more harmful solutions. </p>\n\n<p>I did stop eventually. I stopped when I got the help I needed. I stopped because <em>I</em> wanted to, not because anyone made me. The treatment didn\u2019t work because of the treatment, because it was the correct treatment or because it was so successful. Though it was. It worked because I wanted it. Because I wanted to do it so I put in the effort and the work to <em>make it work</em>. It wasn\u2019t easy, it never is. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like with meds, whatever they are. They will not and can not ever work if the patient won\u2019t take them. You can have the best painkillers in the world and they won\u2019t ever help if you never actually take them. It\u2019s not enough to go to a doctor and get a prescription and go to them pharmacy and buy them and take them home and put them in the medicine cabinet. You, yourself have to go to the medicine cabinet and take them out and swallow one when you need tut in order for them to actually help ease your pain. </p>\n\n<p>My migraine medicine does absolutely nothing to help me if I don\u2019t actually take it when I have a migraine. I said I wanted help. I went to the doctor, I got diagnosed with migraine, I got migraine medication prescribed, I went to the pharmacy and bought them, I took them home and put them in my medicine cabinet. They still don\u2019t work because that\u2019s not enough. I have to remember that I have them and use the tools I have been given myself for it to actually make any difference. If I don\u2019t make the effort of going to get them and taking one when I have migraines it will never work. Never ever make any difference. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not the rehab that fails. It\u2019s the patient. The  treatment provides him with tools, it\u2019s up to him to actually use those tools when he needs them. It doesn\u2019t work because every time he feels the urge he gets to chose. The easy way or the hard way? Succumb to the urge or use the tools he has been provided and suffer through it. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn\u2019t cured. I am addicted to cutting myself. And I am severely suicidal and just want to die. Every time life gets extra hard I want to die. When I\u2019m hurting I want to die and I want to hurt myself. It\u2019s an addiction, I feel the need, the want strongly. And every time I have a choice to make. Use the tools that I have been given to suffer though it it or just take the easy path and give in. And it is hard to choose not to, it is very hard and it takes a lot of effort and energy and will power. But I have been wanting to kill myself for over 20 years and I have not even attempted to do so for around ten to fifteen years despite that being what I want more than anything else. Because I choose to live. I choose to not give up. I make that choice every time I get pushed to the edge, over and over and over.

I was too toxic to keep around and even though it was painful for them to do that, they needed to exercise boundaries with me or else they would be dragged down the hole with me. Being confronted with the fact that I was ODing and would die alone was definitely the kick in the ass I needed to get help. When I was sober about 3 months I reached out to my parents who were already going to Al-Anon and they cautiously welcomed me back under serious rules. \n\nAddicts need boundaries. Yes, even if you're scared they're going to OD. It's also not naive for the family to seek help when cutting off an addict. Sometimes you need to do it for your own sake. I don't blame my parents at all. Now we have a great relationship and I also gained many of my friends back. No one could have done that but me though. I needed to put in the work.

I was too toxic to keep around and even though it was painful for them to do that, they needed to exercise boundaries with me or else they would be dragged down the hole with me. Being confronted with the fact that I was ODing and would die alone was definitely the kick in the ass I needed to get help. When I was sober about 3 months I reached out to my parents who were already going to Al-Anon and they cautiously welcomed me back under serious rules. </p>\n\n<p>Addicts need boundaries. Yes, even if you&#39;re scared they&#39;re going to OD. It&#39;s also not naive for the family to seek help when cutting off an addict. Sometimes you need to do it for your own sake. I don&#39;t blame my parents at all. Now we have a great relationship and I also gained many of my friends back. No one could have done that but me though. I needed to put in the work. People around you can only support, they can&#39;t do it for you.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I am so sorry about your father.  There's so much misinformation when it comes to addicts. It goes to show that all addicts walk along a ditch.  One misstep and the addict is back in that proverbial ditch. It's horrible when it happens, but in it's own crappy way it's good to see that someone who looks like a pillar of sobriety can stumble occasionally. It makes the disease seem more human and helps me a lot when it comes to my own sober journey.\n\nI've hit the famous \"rock bottom\" too many times to count. Heck, I've nearly been beaten to death before and that didn't stop me. I was wasted, my Uber didn't want to drop me at my apartment door. I ended up being beat as part of a gang initiation. I'm not in a gang, I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Major TBI with bleeds and hematomas. I spent over a month in the hospital and outpatient rehab learning how to walk, talk, be human again. The best part of that time was  I was clean. That was the longest time I've went in my whole life sober since I had started drinking. What did I do? Buy a 4 loko as soon as I was released. Ugh.\n\nBefore and after that injury I've tried to die because I was just so tired of existing. I hated being a burden.  I hated I couldn't get clean. I hated myself. I didn't get clean when I lost loved ones who didn't want to deal with me anymore. I didn't get clean after being in the hospital. I didn't get clean even though I knew it would help stop my suicidal idealization.   \n\n\nWhat I'm saying is, rock bottom isn't some special place addicts \\*have\\* to hit to get clean. Nor is it some stepping stone to getting clean. I've seen addicts not hit rock bottom and get better. I personally know myself and other addicts who have hit rock bottom over and over again but still don't learn their lesson. \n\nI was no where near rock bottom when I decided to try the sober life. I could work. I could walk again. I could even afford my habit without having to drink nasty things like 4loko. If anyone saw me out and about you wouldn't have pegged me for a sloppy alcoholic at home.  I didn't get clean until I was sitting outside one day, bottles scattered on my porch, using the water hose for water to mix my drinks because I didn't want to go inside and let my fiance see how drunk I was.  I got clean because for some reason at that time, it was time. That's really the only reason I can give.\n\nSame exact scenario for my fiance except his problems were opiates and subs. He was snorting fent back in the day during his rock bottom. After that he got on subs to help him get away from fent. Yet, he still felt like an addict because the subs were still running his life.  He chose to quit subs over 2.5 years ago because he said he felt like it was time.\n\nFor me when it was my time, I immediately made a taper spreadsheet and stuck with it. It took me two months to safely stop drinking. I have over 111 full days sober now.  I am thankful every single day my brain said it's time to stop. I thank the stars every single day my fiance's brain told him it was time. I just wish I knew how to give other people the same feeling that  we had because it hurts my heart seeing how much addiction ruins lives.",

And assuming this fails, does OP really think they&#39;ll stop at $30,000? &quot;There&#39;s this 90 day program...&quot; &quot;It&#39;s supposed to be really good...&quot; &quot;This is the last time I promise...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>They&#39;d ask for every dime and leave the daughter high and dry. Especially when she has no way of getting grants (she is probably eligible for loans, unless OP and her husband are making 7 figures which, given the circumstances I doubt). So instead of graduating debt-free from an exceptional college, the daughter would be asked to graduate with immense debt from a more affordable college. </p>\n\n<p>OP needs to put her foot down HARD and make sure the daughter does not feel responsible here. Some family therapy would probably help too, since this could really drive a wedge between OP and her husband.</p>\n</div>",
