Shriner's hospitals for children are great for burns, orthopedic issues and something else that I can't remember.  They never require payment.  If your father's income is low, most hospitals have charity programs that will write off the cost.  If the big expense is drugs, then drug companies have prescription assistance programs that will provide free medications.  \n\nLastly, most medicaid programs have spenddown programs where you provide evidence of bills, and they pay for the vast majority of them.

You don&#39;t have to help them but if you are in a position where you can comfortably do it without any sort of drawback for you, why not? I am surprised by the immense lack of empathy we have going on in this thread. I feel like everyone is roleplaying libertarians in here with the whole &quot;it isn&#39;t your fault let her parents shoulder this burden.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>So yes he sucks for being a cheating POS and attempting to guilt trip you into it. But you also suck for lacking empathy for this poor girl, if you don&#39;t help I suggest you cut them off completely because you are never going to actually let go of the pain and you will be the source of their anger for the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>",

I can't believe this isn't at the top and I had to scroll through so many other comments to reach here.\n\nOP, if you consider your half sister a third person and say if a  GoFundMe page was setup for her, would you donate anything?  Say $10, $50? If so, then contribute whatever you can and tell your father that's what you can do.  But justifying your refusal to help altogether just seems cold.\n\nForget your inheritance for a second and assume your parents had a smoother break up.  Even if you never cultivated a relationship with your half sister, given the situation, will you be willing to contribute some of your current income towards her treatment? If not, then tell your father that instead of hiding behind your dead mom and her supposed wishes.  If instead you would, then do what you can from your income and tell your father that your mom's money is off the table but here's what you can do.",

It's filled with bandwagon jumpers ready to jump on the first halfway clearly thought out post regardless and then defend it to death. This sub will declare that a germaphobe not letting a drunk girlfriend of a roommate wake him up to let her use his private bathroom is an asshole, but that a girl letting her poorer half-sister with a life-threatening illness die is not an asshole. It's ridiculous.\n\nI'm not saying OP is an asshole per se. This one is extremely complicated. But it's certainly not an easy \"NTA! You're father's an asshole and you don't owe your sister a penny! Go eat some cake and forget about her!\" sentiment as seen in some high voted comments.\n\nFrankly, her father might not have should've said that to her about could she live with herself, but his sentiment his right and she should've thought of that herself. Can she live with herself? She's the only one in the family with means to help pay for this girl's treatment. People have given more for complete strangers before. She still has a relationship with her dad regardless of how she downplays it, so this is her family tenuous as it might be.\n\nI'm not saying she should go broke for this. But her mother's feelings have nothing to do with it. And for all we know, her mother if still alive might've even given money to help this girl out of the kindness of her heart if the ex-husband asked. If she has enough money to help this girl and still have enough to live a comfortable life and run a business, I would personally recommend she should because I'm not sure if it were me that I could live with myself if I didn't. And I have a similar type of half-sibling whom I'm not so happy about. But if I were richer and they were in life-threatening circumstances I think I'd help them out. And we don't know that they'd never see this money again. I bet the father said they might try to pay it back later. She shouldn't hold him or the girl to that and consider this charity if she did it, but I'm just saying the money might not just be completely 'gone' if she does this, she might get some or all of it back eventually.\n\nOP seems to have some very hard feelings she still needs to work out regarding her father and half-sibling, and this has happenend when they haven't been worked out. OP should try to put their feelings aside to view this as objectively as possible. Perhaps instead of just giving money, ask to be informed of the care circumstances more closely to get an idea of what's going on with the care costs exactly and see if there's any way to try to help get them more reduced price/free care, especially if the girl is still a child/minor. But then also be prepared to help with money too.\n\nI honestly don't see how she could not help in this situation, but that's just me. It is really up to her. I actually would say she's an asshole for not helping, but this is not an easy one, it's very difficult because I do understand you can't help everybody, she's not close to this girl, and who knows how much money she'll lose by helping out. But I just cannot see a way to justify to myself telling her she's not an asshole for letting her half-sister die because she doesn't want to give them money for health care. Just me though. Really, I think this situation is way above the pay-grade of this forum and I hate thinking she's reading all these NTAs with very shallow simplistic reasonings, confirming to herself she's right to be so spiteful and cruel when she has the means to help a person whose life is in danger who has this type of connection to her.",

Clearly instead of investing in yourself, you should be investing in other people\u2019s dying kids right?\n\nYou and op are not the same age and have very different work priorities. Period. Op isn\u2019t in college. But similarly, a business is their life investment, similarly to you choosing college to be yours. OP has every right to continue supporting her lifelong investment. If you\u2019re not going to also say that that child\u2019s health is more important than your education, then don\u2019t put that same expectation on OP. \n\nAnd comfortable can mean a lot of things. As an American, our health system is straight garbag\u00e8. That may not be a small bill to be covering for someone. Business are a lot of work and money, it\u2019s not the best financial decision to spend that \u201ccushion\u201d elsewhere so willy nilly and not have it just in case (even though to others it looks like you\u2019re just scrooging money in the bank)\n\nYeah this sub can be toxic. But the point of most posts is it\u2019s not as black and white. Which I don\u2019t think this is, personally (obviously). And I know it\u2019s obviously easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s money, but I also wouldn\u2019t give the money. I may be \u201ccomfortable\u201d now (I\u2019m not) but giving that money may make me uncomfortable. And those sacrifices are for parents or loved ones, I\u2019m neither. Not a difficult no for me in that case",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I think any person, including your mother,  would rather help a dying child than a growing company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know this is a stretch but fuck it... </p>\n\n<p>Then why are you being so selfish and only able to donate so little just because you\u2019re a \u201ccollege student\u201d? Clearly instead of investing in yourself, you should be investing in other people\u2019s dying kids right?</p>\n\n<p>You and op are not the same age and have very different work priorities. Period. Op isn\u2019t in college. But similarly, a business is their life investment, similarly to you choosing college to be yours. OP has every right to continue supporting her lifelong investment. If you\u2019re not going to also say that that child\u2019s health is more important than your education, then don\u2019t put that same expectation on OP. </p>\n\n<p>And comfortable can mean a lot of things. As an American, our health system is straight garbag\u00e8. That may not be a small bill to be covering for someone. Business are a lot of work and money, it\u2019s not the best financial decision to spend that \u201ccushion\u201d elsewhere so willy nilly and not have it just in case (even though to others it looks like you\u2019re just scrooging money in the bank)</p>\n\n<p>Yeah this sub can be toxic. But the point of most posts is it\u2019s not as black and white. Which I don\u2019t think this is, personally (obviously). And I know it\u2019s obviously easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s money, but I also wouldn\u2019t give the money. I may be \u201ccomfortable\u201d now (I\u2019m not) but giving that money may make me uncomfortable. And those sacrifices are for parents or loved ones, I\u2019m neither. Not a difficult no for me in that case</p>\n</div>",
