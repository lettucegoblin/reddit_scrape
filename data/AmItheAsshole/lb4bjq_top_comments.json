My second grade teacher refused to use my first name, because there were two other boys with the same name in my class. They both got to use their name, though. It was traumatizing to know that if I put my first name on any assignments they wouldn't be counted, and having to explain to substitutes why my papers only had my last name on them. Everyone in that class followed the teachers lead and called me by my last name only, and it followed me for the rest of school.\n\nThe other incident that has stayed with me is when I was a sophomore, so about 15 yo. A new guy came to our school that year who was a grade below me. We were a small school, my graduating class had 30 people and we have about 130 in the entire high school, so everyone knew everyone. My favorite teacher and coach for my academic teams pulled me aside because me and this new boy had become friends. He was a huge geek like I was, and had also joined the same academic teams I was a part of. She warned me that a lot of the students thought he was gay, and that I should reconsider my friendship with him because she didn't want that kind of reputation rubbing off on me. Irony of ironies, I was the one who was gay and closeted because I lived in South Georgia and it was 1996. I still remember the stab of betrayal when she told me that. That guy and I remained best friends until a month before the end of my senior year when, another irony, I came out to him and he cut all ties with me because he didn't want to be associated with people like me.\n\nBut, I digress. You're telling your story and sharing your truth. Your experience in high school was beyond shitty and those in charge failed you. One thing about telling the truth, a lot of people aren't going to like it. Sucks to be them. People forget that actions have consequences, it doesn't matter how long ago they happened.",

Everything was fine for my first year (I started there as a sophomore), but as I got into my junior year things began taking a turn. I was kind of \u201cslipped in\u201d to my major, meaning I auditioned with the administration and not the teacher who taught that major. They did that mainly due to me transferring a little later in the year, and to save time. \n\nMy teacher at first ignored me, nothing bad at all, he was amicable and friendly. But I swear that man was the biggest manipulator I have ever met. I noticed something was off when he started using class to \u201cpsycho analyze\u201d us, to show how he would \u201cact\u201d in our presence. Just a bunch of nonesense really, but I learned that he\u2019d talked to our school counselor about us, a counselor we had to meet with atleast once a month to \u201cdecrease stress.\u201d Well, he learned a LOT about me, since I saw her nearly every week. I knew something was up when he started bringing stuff up about my home life and past trauma for \u201cmy turn\u201d. I was horrified, but didn\u2019t say anything, for all the other students knew he could have been making it up. \n\nHe went back to being friendly but distant til it came to the musical auditions. Keep in mind, he didn\u2019t have any idea if I was talented or not, so he didn\u2019t expect much. But it was mandatory to audition, part of our grade etc. I guess I surprised him, because I got a lead role in it, and after that he was incredibly friendly to me. Like bringing snacks for me, bragging about me to the class I was in (I was in the freshman class due to my late admission), and eventually transferring  me to the top class with the seniors and juniors. \n\nI was so happy, felt like I was actually decent at my major, basically at my highest I\u2019d ever been. I became friends with his absolute favorite student (he\u2019d joke that she was his daughter, they were very close.) After we became friends she started getting pretty mean, until on the night of one of our dress rehearsals she blew up at some of the kids that did our costumes. I felt so bad for them, she was going on a whole spiel about how they \u201cwere only costume majors,\u201d and that she was actually going to be famous when she was older. She tried to get me to chime in but I told her she was being a bitch and walked off.\n\nAfter that, a looot of things changed for me. She told our teacher that I had called her a bitch, without telling him what she had done of course, and I became enemy number 1 in his eyes. He started criticizing me harder than he ever had before, berating me in front of the class about the clothes I wore (his excuse was that as his students we should dress as nice as we could to show that our major was better than the others, my jeans and hoodies suddenly weren\u2019t making the cut) just being so rude. \n\nHe got worse and worse to the point where I dreaded going to class, and none of my classmates wanted to associate with me due to them not wanting him to hate them too. I was so alone, and not even the administration would listen to me, they thought I was being dramatic. That is, until I recorded one of the little chats he had with me in his office. \n\nI got a whole audio recording of him telling me I\u2019d never amount to anything, and I was terrible for leaving Maddi (fake name ofc) in her time of need, and how could I call her such an awful word? Basically a five minute rant about how he hated having me in his class and how none of the other students wanted me there either. I left the class with tears in my eyes, he called the hall monitors on me for \u201cditching.\u201d And I ran to the deans office with my proof.\n\nI played that tape and I swear I could see the exact moment the dean realized that I had been telling the truth the entire time. Apparently my teacher had been questioned at first when I brought up the issue, but he had made it seem like I was overly fond of being dramatic, and that nothing was wrong. \n\nNo one believed me till I had irrefutable proof. I finally got out of that major, but life was still terrible. So no, NTA. I wish I could warn future student about my terrible experience with that school. That teacher still works there, as does the administration that took his side over mine without even investigating.\n\nYou did the right thing, hopefully things change for the better at that school, and if not, at least the students know what they\u2019re getting in to.",

She came home to tell me that my teacher was shocked and told her to tell me that the next time I was attacked to come and tell her.  I happily went to school feeling protected.

But I definitely would acknowledge it and support the bullied individual in trying to find coping strategies and ways to help their own mental well being. \n\nFor example, when I\u2019ve had students come to me about issues with a classmate outside, I usually ask them what they would like me to do and give some possibilities - would they like me to talk 1:1 with the other person? Would they like me to mediate a conversation between them? Would they like for me to discuss the topic as a class without mentioning anyone\u2019s names? Would they like to do X for a bit to calm down? Would they like me to talk to the school counsellor to set up an appointment for them? \n\nI would discuss with the child what I can do for and with them - which would also be things I could discuss with their family. I would also encourage the student to discuss their problems with their family (Ive actually done this before when I was being ignored by admin for an issue with a student... parents weren\u2019t coming to the school about some issues and I as the teacher was being totally ignored by admin - was a toxic work environment- .. I really needed the support of some parents but I couldn\u2019t ask or tell the parents anything like that... but I can certainly encourage open honesty between students and their families!)\n\nSo my conversations with families are very student-specific. But yes, I would always let them know that I hear their concern and take it seriously. I just can\u2019t disclose what I may or may not be doing to address it if I could violate another student\u2019s confidentiality.

And then I will remind them that the same confidentiality applies to all of my students - this goes for positive things to like helping younger child forge friendships outside of school - I\u2019ve had parents let me know they\u2019d really like to get in contact with another parent to arrange a sleepover.

The first time I was suicidal was when I was a child and just wanted out.  (Then I realised that it would only remove me from the problem, leaving my mother and sister with the problem, and possibly getting worse.  So I decided that it was easier to get rid of the problem.  Ultimately, I didn&#39;t.  He died of natural causes, but way too late for my mental health.)</p>\n\n<p>Just because other people only saw the persona your father presented doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re wrong.  It just shows how insidious abusers are.  It shows that he knew that HE was in the wrong, to hide that side of him from other people in public.  Now I more freely talk about it, and if people were fooled by him have to readjust their worldviews, tough.  I have anxiety and depression because of him, and I&#39;m not letting anyone else think well of someone who&#39;s reduced me to this.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Oh well I defnitely have some issues with my parents but they definitely stood up for us. School administrators and some teachers definitely became afraid. Your mom sounds even cooler. That whole flannel thing happened in my area as well in the 90s. Somehow though I guess they thought the idea that it meant a gang was dumb considering where we were. For my dad I remember when I fell off the monkey bars at recess. I apparently sprained my diaphragm (because I injure all the weird things) and couldn't get up. No one noticed for a while. Eventually a school nurse? Someone came out checked on me, and then I was still there alone when my dad came, he worked more than half and hour away so I was there a while. He came, checked on me and then told me he'd be right back. He was super pissed and yelled at them for leaving me alone. I could honestly hear him swearing up a storm in the front office from where I was. I was six. And my mom, well she was the scariest. She ripped into my fifth grade teacher because I sat in class reading. I finished some work, I'd read. Teacher would be in the middle of a lesson, but I had already read through what she was teaching, I'd read. Teach was super annoyed. My mom was like well she has already gotten past where you're teaching or she wouldn't be reading. Ask her a question and you will find she's still paying attention. Is she acting out or bothering anyone? No. She's just sitting there reading. What exactly is your problem? \nI mean I repsecti teachers but just like with so many things nothing is all encompassing. There are good and bad, and just as parents need to stand up for their kids and take care of them, there are some teachers who have to deal with the fact that some parents aren't parenting their kids but somehow all the problems rest with the teacher. I can understand how many teachers get burnt out really quickly.",

Your mom sounds even cooler. That whole flannel thing happened in my area as well in the 90s. Somehow though I guess they thought the idea that it meant a gang was dumb considering where we were. For my dad I remember when I fell off the monkey bars at recess. I apparently sprained my diaphragm (because I injure all the weird things) and couldn&#39;t get up. No one noticed for a while. Eventually a school nurse? Someone came out checked on me, and then I was still there alone when my dad came, he worked more than half and hour away so I was there a while. He came, checked on me and then told me he&#39;d be right back. He was super pissed and yelled at them for leaving me alone. I could honestly hear him swearing up a storm in the front office from where I was. I was six. And my mom, well she was the scariest. She ripped into my fifth grade teacher because I sat in class reading. I finished some work, I&#39;d read. Teacher would be in the middle of a lesson, but I had already read through what she was teaching, I&#39;d read. Teach was super annoyed. My mom was like well she has already gotten past where you&#39;re teaching or she wouldn&#39;t be reading. Ask her a question and you will find she&#39;s still paying attention. Is she acting out or bothering anyone? No. She&#39;s just sitting there reading. What exactly is your problem? \nI mean I repsecti teachers but just like with so many things nothing is all encompassing. There are good and bad, and just as parents need to stand up for their kids and take care of them, there are some teachers who have to deal with the fact that some parents aren&#39;t parenting their kids but somehow all the problems rest with the teacher. I can understand how many teachers get burnt out really quickly.</p>\n</div>",
