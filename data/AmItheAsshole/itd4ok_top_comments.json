She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like \"I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children\".  \n\n\nNow that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. \n\nWell, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a \"healthy marriage\". But its my daughter's happiness that matters.

Don't try to \"fix it\" - I know that's a common dad instinct! - but do offer to do things that will take stress off her plate. She's going to need some serious self-care time, so even little things like bringing her food, running errands, or just offering hugs will make a difference.\n\nNTA, and you're a good dad. Even if he was being pressured by his parents to go along with the whole dowry demand, his response to them should have been a giant middle finger if he didn't agree with them. The fact that he acquiesced so seemingly easily to such an outdated and sexist tradition means your daughter would have been in for hellish marriage.",

I saw it as a kid in the 1970s and of course at the time, we didn't know the ending, so throughout the whole movie its a mystery why most of the women seem to be such perfect housewives or if they aren't at the start, they suddenly turn into them. When the answer was revealed, it was a real mindfuck and  done in a terrifying way. \nEven though you already know the movie's secret, it's still such a well done film, I think its definitely worth seeing. \nThe remake however...well, that was more of mixed bag in my opinion. I didn't find it awful(although I think some people did), but it wasn't nearly as well done or compelling as the original.   The filmmakers seem to approach it as a black comedy,where the first one was more of a straight drama/mystery/horror.   Also the ending was changed somewhat, so that it wasn't as dark as the original, but I wont spoil it so in case you decide to see it, you'll still have some surprises.",
