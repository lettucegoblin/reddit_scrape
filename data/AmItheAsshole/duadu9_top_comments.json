I don't really follow recipes, I just adapt recipes I find online and change stuff along the way so this is the best I can explain:\n\n**pumpkin-carrot cheese sauce**: I adapted this recipe from the vegan mac & cheese recipe of chocolate covered katie (literally the first link that pops up on google search when you google \"vegan mac & cheese\"). But instead of purely using pumpkin puree I used 1/2 pumpkin puree and 1/2 carrot puree (pumpkin is kinda starchy i think so i wanted to add something more nutritious). Then instead of cashews I used silken tofu (I read that cashews are high-calorie and pretty fatty even if it's the good kind of fat), the texture came out creamy and you can't really taste the tofu once you add the nutritional yeast (aka vegan cheese) so be liberal with the yeast for that cheese flavor   \n\n\n**green smoothies**: honestly the best way to fill yourself with greens without actually tasting the greens. DO NOT use watery fruits like apples/watermelons/pears\u2014have tried adding these before and just makes it taste disgusting. bananas/avocados are a great creamy base and then you can add fruits that match it like bananas+strawberry or avocado+peaches and blend them with a non-dairy milk (I use oat milk) then add a handful of leafy greens (I usually use spinach and romaine lettuce.) If you like matcha then mango+bananas+coconut milk (full cream) and spinach is the best combo, then you can add as much matcha powder as you like. If you don't like non-dairy milk then whey powder is also a good option, I personally use a berry flavored whey powder and mix it with a frozen banana, oat milk, and spinach!   \n\n\n**cauliflower fried rice**: you can get any ole' fried rice recipe and just switch out the rice for 1/2 rice and 1/2 crushed cauliflower. crushing the cauliflower in a food processor is the easiest way but you can do it by hand, it's just time-consuming. you can also replace the rice entirely with cauliflower if you like. saute the cauliflower (and rice if you're still adding it) with some garlic and white onions, then add 1 meat (shrimp, chicken strips, beef cubes, etc) and some vegetables of your choice (brocolli, cauliflower, diced carrots, etc). When I made this for my sister I just used shrimp lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nplease live healthy lives!!! diabetes is awful!!",

It&#39;s borderline abuse, letting her do this to herself, and it&#39;s definitely negligence.</p>\n\n<p>My dad is a chef, and the motto is &quot;never mess with someone&#39;s food.&quot; You should have asked for her consent if you knew she was that averse to it. Never lie to anybody about their food. </p>\n\n<p>Even first aid respondents have to ask for permission to conduct aid, because ultimately, it&#39;s her body. Lying about what you&#39;re putting inside of her is unethical, though I admit that you have a good cause.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly can&#39;t understand what the people on this sub are thinking. They responded to a similar post about a vegan being tricked into eat meat by saying that she should sue her friends for doing that?? And suddenly you get a pass because it&#39;s for a good cause? Yeah... No.</p>\n\n<p>You get minus asshole points for having a good intentions, but it&#39;s still unethical. Just speak to your sister frankly and tell her that she has to start eating properly, and educate your mother on nutrition. If they don&#39;t listen? Walk away. Some people don&#39;t want help, and you&#39;ll just have to accept that.</p>\n</div>",

She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. As it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \"fun\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \"acceptable\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread. \n\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \"green\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it. \n\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \"unethical\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I agree that this sounds like there might be an underlying endocrine problem (although hair falling out sounds more like hypothyroidism than PCOS).  It\u2019s absolutely not hard at all to check for thyroid problems; you can easily do a blood test to check.\n\nThe other major thing I\u2019m worried about is vitamin deficiencies since she is a picky eater. Is your sister taking a multivitamin?  If not, it might be a good idea for her to start one just to make up for all the holes in her diet. \n\nDoes your sister snore?  It might be worth it to ask about a sleep study if she does.  Using a cpap at night won\u2019t fix most of what\u2019s going on here, but if she does have untreated obstructive sleep apnea, a cpap might help her low energy levels and reduce risk of hypertension and complications of diabetes. \n\nThat being said, I think you need to talk to your mom and sister about these concerns before bringing them up with her doctor. I think you\u2019re coming from a very good place, but your sister is old enough that she *should* be able to understand these concerns about her health and agree that one of you should bring it up to her doctor.\n\nEdit: Also, based on other comments, it sounds like your sister might have some other problems that you don\u2019t know a lot about.  It\u2019s weird for a 16-year-old to be this picky or to have high uric acid and need to avoid beans.  You might want to ask your mom and sister more about this.",

A huge turning point in my progression was finding a nutritionist who specializes in working with ARFID children. She took me on as a 20\u2019s-aged client and we learned a lot from each other, since she\u2019s usually working with young people who can\u2019t articulate their experience with ARFID so easily. \n\nProgression happens mentally. OP is doing a good thing for her sister by finding ways to make healthier foods acceptable. Step 1 was finding a taste sis can like, Step 2 is getting sis the support she needs to establish that final link that the \u2018unsafe\u2019 foods can be acceptable and not scary. \n\nRegulating my eating is a challenge every single day. Now that I have more knowledge and validation to approach my disorder with, I feel like I have a much better chance at improving over the years.

Second: circulation goes downhill fast, so your extremities (especially feet) don't get anything close to proper blood flow. This means that your clotting system, immune system, and repair systems don't work as fast. That little cut my dad got? Never sealed up properly, the skin wouldn't reseal, and it got infected.
