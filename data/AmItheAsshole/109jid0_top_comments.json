My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn\u2019t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn\u2019t even explain to me what was going on, just \u201cyou\u2019re going to go visit gran for awhile\u201d and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now.\n\nMy sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment.\n\nThey finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like \u201cYou really don\u2019t recognize us?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, are you my dad\u2019s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d\n\nMy gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.

My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn\u2019t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn\u2019t even explain to me what was going on, just \u201cyou\u2019re going to go visit gran for awhile\u201d and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now.</p>\n\n<p>My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like \u201cYou really don\u2019t recognize us?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, are you my dad\u2019s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they\u2019re grieving, but I don\u2019t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My son\u2019s adoption decree and his new birth certificate with my name listed as his mother are the most important pieces of paper I have. I\u2019m so glad you grew up loved and supported. Your former parental unit is in your rear view mirror, enjoy looking forward!</p>\n</div>",

As some others have recommended, I think therapy could be a very beneficial thing for you, when you're ready for it. I also think it might be worth considering those things that your sister wanted you two to do together someday, and going out to do them on your own, or with your REAL parents (meaning the ones who raised you). That might help you to grieve properly, and also honor the memory of your sister, and the relationship that you two were denied. I have no doubt that she'll be there with you in spirit.",

That was an immense loss that you had to suffer multiple times in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like your sister truly loved you, and never stopped wanting you around. As some others have recommended, I think therapy could be a very beneficial thing for you, when you&#39;re ready for it. I also think it might be worth considering those things that your sister wanted you two to do together someday, and going out to do them on your own, or with your REAL parents (meaning the ones who raised you). That might help you to grieve properly, and also honor the memory of your sister, and the relationship that you two were denied. I have no doubt that she&#39;ll be there with you in spirit.</p>\n</div>",

Then no meaningful contact (5 visits in 5 years) then nothing as OP stopped try to maintain the relationship when they were 11 years old. \n\nI imagine most children would have been crushed by this. Thankfully OP had a supportive and loving grandma as well as an aunt and uncle who stepped up and were their parents in every way but legally.\n\nI wonder if with the lack of interest/contact if OP\u2019s bio parents were even aware OP was legally adopted by uncle and aunt?  \n\nSo now that their eldest has passed which is indeed sad, they think they should be able to pick up where they left off with OP?  \n\nNope\n\nThey abandoned their child for 15 years. The 6 year old child is now a 21 year old adult who they don\u2019t even know.   \n\nOP has picked the parents who truly supported them. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP really owes the bio parents an explanation but if it saves OP from having them keep trying to force themselves on them then I would likely respond. \n\nSomething maybe along the lines of while yes they are your bio parents you have no emotional attachment to them after 15 years of being abandoned and ignored.  You have been adopted by the people who raised you and who you recognize as your actual parents.  You wish your bio parents well but require no additional contact with them.   Assuming this is what you want. \n\nAs to the other pearl clutching relatives who say OP is being harsh were they even around all these years?  Or like the the bio parents they are only concerned as those poor people recently lost their daughter?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA </p>\n\n<p>I am sorry for OP having to go through this. </p>\n\n<p>OP was parked at grandma\u2019s and aunt/uncle with the explanation from their bio parents being your gonna stay a little while.  Then no meaningful contact (5 visits in 5 years) then nothing as OP stopped try to maintain the relationship when they were 11 years old. </p>\n\n<p>I imagine most children would have been crushed by this. Thankfully OP had a supportive and loving grandma as well as an aunt and uncle who stepped up and were their parents in every way but legally.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if with the lack of interest/contact if OP\u2019s bio parents were even aware OP was legally adopted by uncle and aunt?  </p>\n\n<p>So now that their eldest has passed which is indeed sad, they think they should be able to pick up where they left off with OP?  </p>\n\n<p>Nope</p>\n\n<p>They abandoned their child for 15 years. The 6 year old child is now a 21 year old adult who they don\u2019t even know.   </p>\n\n<p>OP has picked the parents who truly supported them. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think OP really owes the bio parents an explanation but if it saves OP from having them keep trying to force themselves on them then I would likely respond. </p>\n\n<p>Something maybe along the lines of while yes they are your bio parents you have no emotional attachment to them after 15 years of being abandoned and ignored.  You have been adopted by the people who raised you and who you recognize as your actual parents.  You wish your bio parents well but require no additional contact with them.   Assuming this is what you want. </p>\n\n<p>As to the other pearl clutching relatives who say OP is being harsh were they even around all these years?  Or like the the bio parents they are only concerned as those poor people recently lost their daughter?  I\u2019d probably go no contact with them as well. </p>\n\n<p>OP I wish you the best moving forward.</p>\n</div>",

They don't care if you love them or hate them; they just want you to feel *something* and that gives them satisfaction. \n\nThe only way to hurt them is to wound their pride with indifference. I don't love you, I don't hate you. I care so little about you that your very existence doesn't even register any kind of feeling. \n\nA few years back I was dating a guy. I found out we were done when I logged into social media one day and saw that he posted pictures with another woman. My friends were all waiting for some kind of epic showdown.
