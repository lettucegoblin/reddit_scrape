As I am 31f married to 64m (yes he has kids yes they are older than me) </p>\n\n<p>But the things you want to know are not unreasonable when you are trying to look after a relative. They could have been worded slightly better but I totally get where you are coming from. If it had been my husband and I he would have happily answered them. </p>\n\n<p>And being in an age gap relationship you have to be ready for the questions/judgement of not just friends and family but also strangers on the street (yes people have asked if husband is my dad) so if he\u2019s not prepared for that then maybe he needs to be having a long hard think about what he wants out the relationship </p>\n\n<p>So yeah NTA for asking at all.</p>\n</div>",

Talk to him and it\u2019ll be sorted out.\nPissed off or upset he\u2019s intrusive? A decent person would realise that the Uncle could be forgiven for checking on his niece (who was only recently a minor) being with a man 25 years older than her.\nIf someone was a decent person they\u2019d like/love/fancy  the niece enough to put aside any annoyance or upset and deal with the situation constructively even just for their girlfriend\u2019s sake. At that age, if someone lacks the emotional maturity, insight, and/or empathy \u2014- the niece should realise it was the perfect litmus test that sorted a bullet dodging her.</p>\n</div>",

We've been together 15 years and married for 10 and it's never felt weird or like I was being taken advantage of in any way.\n\nI don't know niece and BF's situation, but it's hard to imagine they'd have an even power dynamic in that relationship. I think OP needed to approach niece with these questions and concerns first. He's right to be concerned, but she IS an adult, and tearing into new BF is only going to make her defensive and possibly cause her to pull away from family and run toward BF, even if the relationship is somehow unhealthy.\n\nI have a friend who has daddy issues x 1,000,000 - he only dates guys who are 20-30 years older than he is - and running off any one older boyfriend would not stop him from finding another one. It's possible niece could use some therapy to find out why she might seek out relationships with a mismatched power dynamic, but that is probably better discussed directly with niece and not by going after the BF.",
