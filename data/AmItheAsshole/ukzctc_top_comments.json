Before you go in, sit down and write out every time she has made you uncomfortable, every aspect of copying that you\u2019ve noticed. Try to get evidence, like receipts of purchases you\u2019ve made that she went on to buy. The date of your hairdressing appointment where you dyed your hair, which will predate hers. The dates of you joining societies, you first, and then her. See if any of your classmates are also willing to speak that they have noticed her unhealthy obsession - perhaps the men she\u2019s become obsessed with after noticing you talking to them?\n\nThen make sure the meeting does not include her. You need to feel comfortable to speak openly without her in the room, as she will not react well. When you walk in, immediately thank them for calling for a meeting to address her harassment of you. Take control and lay out everything that\u2019s happened. Explain that you are becoming increasingly concerned for your safety, to the extent you are hiding in your room. It\u2019s affecting your ability to study. She clearly has issues that she needs professional assistance with. If they ask why you haven\u2019t confronted her, reply that you didn\u2019t feel safe because her behaviour is becoming more and more unhinged.\n\nAlso, really highlight that you and your friend posted a photograph to your personal social media while you were at home on Easter break. You were off university grounds, during a university break, using non-university websites. It is entirely out of their purview. You also didn\u2019t send this directly to Kaya, or make any suggestion to her that she do the same. Kaya accessed your social media, made assumptions, and continued her attempt to imitate you. You are NOT responsible for her actions, and her reaction to the realisation she no longer resembled you is alarming.\n\nThen ask them how they are going to protect you from someone whose behaviour is now bordering on stalking. Ask if they are willing to support you in talking to the police about a potential restraining order. And then actually call the police. Whether or not they are able to do anything yet, you need this on record, and they will have information on how to protect yourself.\n\nThis may sounds extreme, but I assure you, it\u2019s not. Kaya is becoming dangerous. She has moved beyond copying to anger. The next step in that escalation is to destroy the object of her attention. That\u2019s why she has reported you. She wants you to be punished. When this doesn\u2019t get the desired results, her frustration will make her angrier. She will eventually get violent if this isn\u2019t nipped in the bud. She may try to cut your hair so that you and she look alike again.\n\nSeptember was only eight months ago. This isn\u2019t a long period of time and look how invested she is already. Please take this seriously. Don\u2019t let embarrassment or a desire to keep the peace prevent you from protecting yourself. Kaya has taken advantage of your good nature so far, and is now trying to mess with your education. Lay down your boundaries in steel. She is not to ever contact you again. You aren\u2019t to have classes together or share living space. Please take care OP. It\u2019s better to prevent it getting worse rather than wait until it actually is worse.",

I\u2019d be afraid of her trying to get you out of the way and filling take over your life. I believe they even made a movie about that.

I hope they make her see a counselor after the meeting! I would have a copy of the pic you posted on hand too. So it doesn't look like you deleted to cover your ass. Not that they can't obviously see that you're not bald but she's probably psycho enough to make a big deal about it.\n\n\nThirdly, this chick has a serious personality disorder. If you live on campus I'd ask to have her move out. If not on campus, have a meeting with the rest of the housemates and vote on whether you all feel safe with her residing with you. Pretty sure when someone is stalking, and that's exactly what she's doing, as well as mimicking you that you can majority vote a housemate out for safety issues. Write down the issues, like you mentioned here, have everyone who votes her out sign it, then speak with your landlord. The sooner the better.\n\n\n If this isn't right, I haven't had roommates in a decade, then shoot whomever you're supposed to meet with an email saying you would like to meet privately either before or after the meeting because you don't feel safe and want to know options. They might not know but they might know where to direct you? This COULD turn dangerous. Having documentation is key. Save texts, emails, anything she sends to you or you've been sent due to her. Also, maybe screenshot any social media pics she's posted that copy you? Showing the dates posted. It's better to have too much than too little in a situation like this because you never know exactly how obsessive she is.",

I hope they make her see a counselor after the meeting! I would have a copy of the pic you posted on hand too. So it doesn&#39;t look like you deleted to cover your ass. Not that they can&#39;t obviously see that you&#39;re not bald but she&#39;s probably psycho enough to make a big deal about it.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, this chick has a serious personality disorder. If you live on campus I&#39;d ask to have her move out. If not on campus, have a meeting with the rest of the housemates and vote on whether you all feel safe with her residing with you. Pretty sure when someone is stalking, and that&#39;s exactly what she&#39;s doing, as well as mimicking you that you can majority vote a housemate out for safety issues. Write down the issues, like you mentioned here, have everyone who votes her out sign it, then speak with your landlord. The sooner the better.</p>\n\n<p>If this isn&#39;t right, I haven&#39;t had roommates in a decade, then shoot whomever you&#39;re supposed to meet with an email saying you would like to meet privately either before or after the meeting because you don&#39;t feel safe and want to know options. They might not know but they might know where to direct you? This COULD turn dangerous. Having documentation is key. Save texts, emails, anything she sends to you or you&#39;ve been sent due to her. Also, maybe screenshot any social media pics she&#39;s posted that copy you? Showing the dates posted. It&#39;s better to have too much than too little in a situation like this because you never know exactly how obsessive she is.</p>\n</div>",

Sh will have lied, to get the Uni to request a meeting.\n\n**OP, Walk into the meeting prepared.** \n\nDo a timeline: Write ALL the incidents of kaya copying you that you recall, dates, times etc. Make a note of people who have noticed her behaviour and commented to you. Make copies, or screenshots of texts/emails/voicemails/social media comments etc kaya has made at you.\n\n**Have a pre-meeting with a lawyer, to get her/his overview and initial advice.** If the Uni gives students access to legal services, ask the lawyer their advice over being stalked, without saying who it is. **If you are in the UK, the Citizen's Advice Bureau can put you in touch with a solicitor who will meet you for free.** Show her/him everything and ask if an injunction/non-molestation order (UK version of restraining order) is possible.\n\nWalk into the meeting prepared. Wait and see what kaya says, why the University thought it was a matter to get involved.\n\n**If kaya doesnt admit to copying you**, just maintain that you were messing around with a friend and you did not aim any of what you were doing to any other student. You hold no responsibility for people copying you. Show the post you made with the fake bald head. And screenshots of her texts to you after you returned. But you are concerned that she has been hounding you since you returned, demanding money, and it is making you uncomfortable and affecting your revision. Can the University please help by re-assigning her to other accommodation? Advantage of this approach: You are not making the UNI examine the history of your problem.

You hold no responsibility for people copying you. Show the post you made with the fake bald head. And screenshots of her texts to you after you returned. But you are concerned that she has been hounding you since you returned, demanding money, and it is making you uncomfortable and affecting your revision. Can the University please help by re-assigning her to other accommodation? Advantage of this approach: You are not making the UNI examine the history of your problem. They only have to admonish her, and keep the two of you separate.<br/>\nIf they do nothing, write a short letter, send it recorded delivery, setting out the problem as you td them at the meeting, and asking them to stop her pestering you.

They can't really blame you for this girl shaving her head.\n\nDo they punish every person at your uni if someone copies their haircut and doesn't like it?\n\nI would come at it from a point of concern instead of anger. Say you're concerned because she's been going out of her way to copy you. Provide examples. They may say this is her way of making friends, if they do you should tell them that if she wanted to be friends you would prefer she be herself and not try to be you. At this point, it could even be considered harassment. Especially her behaviour once you got back to school and she saw your head was not shaved.\n\nBut anyway, the fact of the matter is that you did not tell this girl to shave her head, you did not shave this girl's head, and you did not hold her at gunpoint and force her to shave her head.  You have no responsibility for this girl's actions and you in no way have to pay for a wig.\n\nI would even be a little concerned for you because of the obsessive behaviour this girl is showing you. I would ask if you could speak to the university staff in private beforehand if they want both of you to meet at the same time. Explain your side of the story. Because at this point all they've heard is this other girl's side and I'm assuming she omitted some things and exaggerated others if they're requiring a meeting with you.\n\nI would come at it from a point of concern instead of anger.

At this point, it could even be considered harassment. Especially her behaviour once you got back to school and she saw you're head was not shaved.\n\nIf this girl has a mental disorder they may try to blame that. As someone who works with clients with several mental health disorders and severe behaviours as well as having a few disorders myself, I can tell you that even if they have a mental disorder they are still responsible for their own actions and their diagnosis does not excuse their behaviour and is not a free pass.\n\nSo if they try to say oh she has this, she can't help it. Do not let them get away with that. Tell them \" thank you for providing me with a reason behind her behaviour. How can we go forward with punishing her for harassing me and making sure this behaviour does not continue? I am not satisfied with letting this go unresolved \". Don't let them see you angry, don't raise your voice. If they see you are angry they may use that to get you to agree to something you otherwise wouldn't have\n\nGood luck! If you don't mind updating us after the meeting I would love to hear what happened!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After reading some other comments I wanted to add some advice that seems to be repeated a lot in some comments. Do not let the school know that you posted that with the intention of seeing if this girl would copy you.\n\nYou could tell them you're hairstylist friend was challenging herself to see if she could give you the appearance of a shaved head without actually cutting the hair and wanted to see if the people on your social media would be able to tell the difference.\n\nYou could tell them you were drunk if you are in a country that allows drinking at 19.\n\nYou could say that it was a filter that you were playing with.",

Let\u2019s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We\u2019re not best friends but we are friendly. We don\u2019t really spend much time together.  \n\n\nOver time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn\u2019t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don\u2019t owe the style and she\u2019s free to wear what she likes but it\u2019s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.\n\n\nBut then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I couldn\u2019t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I\u2019d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. \nI joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. \nBasically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It\u2019s just really creepy but I haven\u2019t said anything, I wouldn\u2019t even know what to say.\n\nOver the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.\n\nI deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it\u2019s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.\nShe kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it\u2019s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she\u2019s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
