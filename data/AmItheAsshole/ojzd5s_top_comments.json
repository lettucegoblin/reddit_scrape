Your primary responsibility is your children\u2014*both* of them, including your adopted son, who should be loved no less and no differently than your biological son, no matter the circumstances that brought him into your life\u2014and you already know that and live it every day.\n\nIf your sister cannot be around your son\u2014for whatever reason; it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014and cannot even refrain from saying things like \u201cwhy is *he* here,\u201d then she shouldn\u2019t be welcome in your home. It\u2019s not on you to send your kid away and exclude him, during a family event where he\u2019s playing with the other children, so your sister\u2019s feelings can be addressed.\n\nAdults are allowed to have feelings, but they aren\u2019t allowed to demand that children be emotionally harmed for the sake of those feelings. Being an adult means accepting that there\u2019s a time and a place to address issues, and \u201cnow\u201d isn\u2019t always the time. Asking you to exclude your son is a deal-breaker, and that\u2019s on her. If that\u2019s the only solution she offers for mending your relationship with her, it simply cannot be mended. Frankly, she sounds like she\u2019d be a toxic influence on your adopted son even if she did come around eventually and say she can deal with it. No doubt she\u2019d treat him differently than his brother, and he\u2019d notice.\n\nYour parents were *way* out of line. While I understand they have a legitimate interest in seeing you and your sister mend your relationship, they have absolutely no right to lie to both of you, put everyone\u2014including your adopted son\u2014in an uncomfortable situation, and ruin the family get-together.",

Your primary responsibility is your children\u2014<em>both</em> of them, including your adopted son, who should be loved no less and no differently than your biological son, no matter the circumstances that brought him into your life\u2014and you already know that and live it every day.</p>\n\n<p>If your sister cannot be around your son\u2014for whatever reason; it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014and cannot even refrain from saying things like \u201cwhy is <em>he</em> here,\u201d then she shouldn\u2019t be welcome in your home. It\u2019s not on you to send your kid away and exclude him, during a family event where he\u2019s playing with the other children, so your sister\u2019s feelings can be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>Adults are allowed to have feelings, but they aren\u2019t allowed to demand that children be emotionally harmed for the sake of those feelings. Being an adult means accepting that there\u2019s a time and a place to address issues, and \u201cnow\u201d isn\u2019t always the time. Asking you to exclude your son is a deal-breaker, and that\u2019s on her. If that\u2019s the only solution she offers for mending your relationship with her, it simply cannot be mended. Frankly, she sounds like she\u2019d be a toxic influence on your adopted son even if she did come around eventually and say she can deal with it. No doubt she\u2019d treat him differently than his brother, and he\u2019d notice.</p>\n\n<p>Your parents were <em>way</em> out of line. While I understand they have a legitimate interest in seeing you and your sister mend your relationship, they have absolutely no right to lie to both of you, put everyone\u2014including your adopted son\u2014in an uncomfortable situation, and ruin the family get-together.</p>\n</div>",

My sister is a child therapist and has been for almost 20 years and the only thing she can tell us about her clients without breaching patient confidentiality is that almost all of them are in some kind of a home situation where a bio parent is not involved and where they feel rejected by the extended family of the adoptive parent.

Just so it makes holiday hopping easier for them or what really? There is no ground to give here, she wants to have nothing to do with your kid and your kid is not going anywhere. It is impossible for you to have a relationship where you can both pretend Keith doesn&#39;t exist, plus you don&#39;t want to. I think it&#39;s time to put your parents on time off</p>\n</div>",

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn\u2019t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son\u2019s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). \n\nSurprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister\u2019s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: \nMy ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn\u2019t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he\u2019s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fianc\u00e9 into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s best interest were my main priority. That\u2019s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. \n\nI asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn\u2019t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said \u201cI thought this was family only what\u2019s he doing here.\u201d Loud enough where he could\u2019ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. \n\nMy sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn\u2019t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn\u2019t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she\u2019s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn\u2019t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out. \n\nLike they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me it was like what\u2019s the point of us working it out if that\u2019s how she still feels toward him. Well this is still causing some conflict since I \u201cescalated\u201d the feud by making her leave. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They remind me of my grandparents, who have made every single one of my family's problems so much worse because they think they can manipulate the rest of us into playing \"Leave It to Beaver\". I have played this game too many times and, because of other family issues, I don't visit with my grandparents when other family members are around.\n\nThe reason your mom is mad is not because you handled this poorly. She just wants this conflict between you and your sister to go away because it's (understandably) causing her stress, but she is not willing to confront it from a right/wrong point of view, because that would require her to take a side. *She just wants it to vanish* - so, dollars to donuts, the reason she's actually mad at you is because you didn't follow her internal script. She thought if she could just get sister there that you'd be calm and \"mature\" and everything would be fine. But she won't view sister's comments as what closed the door - you actually kicked her out, so she now views you as the one who blew a hole in her plan.\n\nShe is (or maybe both your parents are) focused only on her own stress and is not thinking about right, wrong, morals, or even the feelings of the rest of the family. They just want this hole filled and they are not thinking about the bigger picture. I urge you to point this out to them if you are interested in maintaining a relationship with them, because your sister's toxicity in this situation will allow her to, bluntly, talk shit about you and Keith to them and they will be too passive/peacemaker-y to correct her, and it will feed their narrative that you are \"unwilling\" to resolve the problems affecting the family. \n\nThe sooner you can get your parents to understand and address the situation head-on and *out loud in front of you*, the better your chances are of them seeing right and wrong here, or at the very least staying out of it instead of trying to manipulate the family into \"just getting over it\".",

I want you to know, however, that this is my son now, and always will be. If you cannot respect that, then we can&#39;t be in contact. But for what happened today, I am sorry.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Given my &#39;flair&#39; is lower in rank to &#39;aspiring LEO&quot; and I don&#39;t get &quot;retired LEO&quot; what do they think I was doing? Playing Solitaire and making up equal opportunity numbers?</p>\n</div>",
