That still doesn't allow them to be THIS GODDAMN INSANE about how much they want a grandson to name after your husband's deceased father.\n\nYou are spot on, they are delusional. They can have their hopes, but having specific decorations with the putative grandson's name all over them is absolutely insulting to you and your daughter. These people are ABSOLUTELY going to treat your daughter as less important than any later sons you might have, and they might even say things to her face when she's older.\n\nYour husband needs to grow the fuck up and remember that YOU and YOUR DAUGHTER are supposed to take precedence over his mother and sister and everyone else. The fact that he's not supporting you in this is absolutely appalling, and he's the biggest AH of the whole bunch. He should be in YOUR corner. He should be telling his mother that this was unacceptable, he should be explaining to her that it's time to celebrate the baby that's coming.\n\nFor your daughter's sake, OP, please do not have any more children with this man until and unless he straightens out and straightens his family out too.",

What respect can they have for OP if they are so disrespectful to an unborn girl? Clearly not a healthy environment for the baby to be brought up in. If husband can&#39;t see that then he is not healthy to be around either. </p>\n\n<p>Well done OP for standing up for your baby! Gather your support around you from your own family and friends.
