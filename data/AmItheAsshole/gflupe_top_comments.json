They don't deserve your friendship. I'm so proud of you for seeking help when you thought you were losing touch with reality but I'm so sorry that anyone would pull such an evil \"prank\" on you. Just so you know, this isn't a prank. It's straight up bullying.

This example that OP went through is enough grounds to cut ties with those people. Whether you know someone&#39;s medical history or not, don&#39;t pull a prank that will fuck with their head.</p>\n</div>",

I was absent from school one day, and as a lesson for the other students, my teacher got the class in on a prank to illustrate the power of suggestion. She had a bright blue podium, but when I came into class the next day, before it started, they all started talking about how she hated that it was painted gray and that she was going to get it painted back to blue. It went on for like 10 minutes. I was freaking the fuck out, and the teacher said something like, \u201coctopus, you okay?\u201d and I mentioned that it looked blue to me. And it kept going, and finally I ended up agreeing that I guess it could have been gray?? I thought I was crazy. They broke it to me and I almost cried. It wasn\u2019t fun.\n\nEDIT: I meant 1984. I'm a dingus. Maybe I shouldn't have been absent that one day, lol.",

We were friends because we did some of the same extracurricular activities, and at parties we\u2019d flirt sometimes, but he definitely was not interested in me and kind of kept his distance. I was desperately in need of the antidepressants I now take, and was just a whirlwind of bad decisions at the time, but this is one of my worst decisions of all time and I live with the regret to this day.\n\nThe other people in his \u201cpopular\u201d friend group were all *very* mean. They would say it was their sense of humor, that everyone was in on it so it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but they could be really cutting. One running joke was that this guy I had a crush on was fat. It couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, he was super athletic and ran marathons and shit, but he also partied pretty hard so he was like muscular and slim with just the tiniest bit of a soft belly, which I thought was soooo sexy. So it never even crossed my mind that he would *believe* what people were saying, and I joined in. The group loved me for it, and the guy would always laugh. I started doing it all the time, because it was the only time I felt accepted into the group, and I thought it was bringing me closer to this guy.\n\nWell, it turned out this guy had an eating disorder, and his \u201cfriends\u201d called him fat all the time on purpose. I don\u2019t know if they thought they could make him realize how *not* fat he was, like how silly it was to be hung up on that because it was so clearly not true, or if they just truly were evil and wanted to hurt him. I sure as hell felt evil when I found out, and to this day I can\u2019t believe I thought it was a good idea to *ridicule someone for months on end about their weight.* What the fuck??\n\nI made some serious, serious errors in judgment. I never should have been pursuing someone who only showed interest in me when he was drunk. I never should have striven to make friends with people who\u2019s sense of humor revolves around cruelty. I never should have been so low and desperate for attention that I lost sight of my morals and values.  But most of all, I never should have joined in on the EXACT same kind of bullying that totally fucked me up coming out of high school, where your \u201cfriends\u201d are \u201cjust teasing\u201d and you should \u201clighten up and take a joke.\u201d The guy never asked me to stop, but I should have fucking known better. I\u2019ll live with that regret for the rest of my life.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m telling you this because your story reminded me of my own shitty actions. I want to apologize to you, if that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m so sorry that you experienced the terrible actions of the people who bullied you, and I\u2019m so *endlessly* sorry that I have participated in that kind of bullying. It\u2019s not okay.",

        "body": "I think everyone has done something while growing up that they reflect on and realize how out of line they were. \n\nFor me it was in middle school (7th Grade). A little back story, this was the first time I had ever had a bigger friend group. Up until this group I typically had one best friend or was kinda a loner... Also, I was the newest person to this friend group so most of the time I went along with what everyone else wanted thinking it was normal. Ugh. Whyyy.\n\nOne of the girls in our group broke up with her boyfriend (of a month) and proceeded to be very clingy, and negative. I'll call her Mary. Mary would invite us over to hang out and watch The Notebook on repeat and cry. She was constantly talking about her ex boyfriend and how much she missed him and how she thought they were going to end up together and eventually get married.  \n\nIt went on for about a month and a half when we all started getting annoyed by her behavior. One of the more outspoken(looking back she was just insecure and controlling) friends (I'll call her Jackie) talked to everyone(excluding Mary of course) and said that Mary has gone too far and we needed to confront her about it and ultimately kick her out of our friend group.  I remember looking around for anyone to disagree and when no one did I figured it must be just how groups of friends work so it was ok.  About a week later, Jackie told Mary to meet us at our usual spot by the lockers. Jackie then had everyone take turns telling Mary how annoying she has been and then ended it with \"So now you can't hang out with us anymore unless you can promise to be less depressing and whiny.\" \n\nLooking back it was so unbelievably cruel. In reality, Mary's parents were going through a really rough time (almost getting divorced), her older sibling was acting out because of it and her boyfriend dumped her after a month of dating but 4 years of being best friends/neighbors. I think about it often and still feel awful I didn't step up for Mary. \n\n  Out of curiosity, have you reached out to the guy and apologized?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think everyone has done something while growing up that they reflect on and realize how out of line they were. </p>\n\n<p>For me it was in middle school (7th Grade). A little back story, this was the first time I had ever had a bigger friend group. Up until this group I typically had one best friend or was kinda a loner... Also, I was the newest person to this friend group so most of the time I went along with what everyone else wanted thinking it was normal. Ugh. Whyyy.</p>\n\n<p>One of the girls in our group broke up with her boyfriend (of a month) and proceeded to be very clingy, and negative. I&#39;ll call her Mary. Mary would invite us over to hang out and watch The Notebook on repeat and cry. She was constantly talking about her ex boyfriend and how much she missed him and how she thought they were going to end up together and eventually get married.  </p>\n\n<p>It went on for about a month and a half when we all started getting annoyed by her behavior. One of the more outspoken(looking back she was just insecure and controlling) friends (I&#39;ll call her Jackie) talked to everyone(excluding Mary of course) and said that Mary has gone too far and we needed to confront her about it and ultimately kick her out of our friend group.  I remember looking around for anyone to disagree and when no one did I figured it must be just how groups of friends work so it was ok.  About a week later, Jackie told Mary to meet us at our usual spot by the lockers. Jackie then had everyone take turns telling Mary how annoying she has been and then ended it with &quot;So now you can&#39;t hang out with us anymore unless you can promise to be less depressing and whiny.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Looking back it was so unbelievably cruel.

So the person doesn't know why or how, but doesn't question their sense of reality. \n\nAnd maybe that's the fine line? I mean, you have to know your target, too, and *not* prey on their known vulnerabilities (not saying OP's friends knew, OP says they didn't), so like if you know someone is terrified of sporks, you can't spork their lawn. But minor vulnerabilities, like someone can't do without their first cup of coffee so you hide the coffee, are ok, but you need to put the coffee somewhere findable, and only if you know the person won't go crazy looking for it...\n\nPranking is *such* a fine line. And a lot rests on how the prank comes out, so to some extent it's one of those things that's undertaken in a vacuum, then judged in hindsight with 20/20 vision. \n\nI'm at NAH. I honestly don't think the friends are assholes here, because they legit didn't think they were doing anything mean spirited or that wrong, certainly nothing that would drive anyone to check into a hospital. And you or me wouldn't have, they just accidentally happened onto a friend's previously-undisclosed weak point. But OP isn't wrong to be pissed as hell, either, because this prank didn't work and had serious life consequences for OP. \n\nThis is why I just don't prank people.",

Little did he know that I, her Canadian roommate, am bilingual. So she brought me the letter and I translated it for her, and then we decided it would be hilarious for her to respond in French with no explanation (because of the aforementioned internet situation, Google translate wouldn't be an option, which her boyfriend knew). She wrote a letter, I translated it, and then she copied it in her own handwriting and sent it off. A couple weeks later she got another letter, and she reported gleefully that he was thoroughly confused. Good prank.",
