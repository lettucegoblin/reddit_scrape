I became really unpopular lol.I guess I could\u2019ve let her off more gracefully and leave her with a bit of pride since she boasted so much instead of embarrassing her in front of her new friends.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s kind of a feeling of like &quot;I know I&#39;m not the asshole...but am I the asshole for ignoring the basic rules when it comes to dealing with coworkers who seem full of shit?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I would feel like a jerk if I did this too, and want some validation. It&#39;s horrifically condescending, but I&#39;d feel badly for pointing out someone&#39;s ignorance and humiliating them, because I pity that person for putting themselves in that position unwittingly. You gotta pity that a little. </p>\n\n<p>My fiancee has a colleague we call Peggy Hill. Guess what language Peggy thinks she can speak that we both speak?</p>\n</div>",

English is everywhere and if you're on the internet you can learn all the little nuance and sayings and such through the sheer amount of exposure. It may also be possible with Spanish since that's spoken quite a lot too, but I think that's about it.\n\nThat being said, I feel like calling oneself fluent because someone can have a basic conversation in a language is a very US thing to do (no offense to US people, I've just never seen it done anywhere else). In mainland Europe - haven't been to the UK much so idk about them - most people speak 2 or 3 foreign languages at least on conversational level and they'll be all \"oh yea you're from X I know some of the language but I only speak it a little\" and then they'll have a deep conversation about the meaning of life or something. It's great, I love it. But it kinda makes me feel bad about not really speaking any European languages besides my native language and English.",
