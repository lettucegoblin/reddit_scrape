This old guy (late 70s) came in every day at the same time and sat in the same booth. He would order one of three meals. One time I sat in \"his\" booth doing some homework (and drinking a ton of coffee refills). The man came in and told me -- not asked -- that I needed to move. I did.

The stories started to come out. I learned he and his late wife came to that restaurant for over 20 years to have dinner. I was sitting in her place. However, I kept asking questions, and he kept relaying his stories. This man lead an AMAZING life, and I listened to any tale he wanted to share. This went on for two years.\n\nWhen he died at the age of 81, I went to his memorial. I met his children and grandchildren. When they asked how I knew him, I told them my tale. His children laughed because he called everyone a little bastard, male and female alike. Then I began to recount some of the stories he told me. His children verified some, but then they heard stories he never told them. I ended up meeting with his children several times to tell them everything he told me.\n\nMr. Banhke, I am not a believer, like I told you many times, but I still think of you and your incredible life.

A truly different kind of friendship. I had a crappy home life and my neighbor knew. She was an old Russian lady, harsh and weathered but caring nonetheless. She\u2019d see me sitting outside on the step (usually because I was kicked out/locked out), and would ask if I was hungry. I\u2019d always say no, and she always knew I was lying, and brought me food anyways. I was a proud child, reluctant and ashamed to acknowledge I needed help, and even more reluctant to accept it. She\u2019d call me over to garden with her when she heard my parents screaming at each other. She taught me how to clean, how to cook. She brushed my hair when it got matted and taught me how to take care of it. On mornings when I was late to get out to the bus stop, she would go out in her nightgown and make the driver wait for me. We spent many moments sitting together in peaceful silence.  \n\nThrough the years, she moved on from basic life skills, and onto life advice. She chased my first boyfriend down the driveway (at nearly 80 years old), and hit him with her cane when she heard him speaking to me harshly, and told me she\u2019d wack me, too, if she ever saw me let a man treat me that way again. She taught me to respect myself and all living things, to have ambition, to never become financially dependent on anyone, to never accept harsh treatment, and to never succumb to sadness or bitterness. She would say, \u201cSolnyshka (little sun), you must wring every drop of joy you can out of this life.\u201d\n\nShe was eccentric and uncaring in how the world perceived her. Unapologetic about herself and who she was, she did not care for pleasantries or the mincing of words. She did what she pleased, when and where and how she wanted to do it. She was bold, and without shame. She had strange and colorful and wonderful decorations in her house and on her lawn. She loved wind chimes and the small, simple, beautiful things in life. She wore bright colors and clothes that never matched, and she was an embarrassment to all who had not yet found the peace in being free.\n\nShe died a few years ago. But sometimes, on still nights, her old wind chimes ring in my doorway, and I know she is still with me.",

I've known of several instances where home owners & business owners have been sued by burglar's who got hurt on their property. One man owned a metal recycling shop, 2 men broke in & he had 2 dogs inside the building. He got tired of being robbed & the local cops not doing nothing about it. Anyway, when the burglar's broke in 1 got mauled by the dog's and the other guy got out. He sued that business owner & won a million dollars because he didn't have warning signs about the dog's. Another bogus lawsuit involved a woman who was a known drug addict who birthed about 15 kid's & lost them or sold them. She stayed drunk & drugged out daily & staggered & fell onto & passed out on  a doctor's car that was parked at his business. They settled out of court for $8000.00.

We have a variance for the 6 foot fence, it was in the public records when i bought the house so we're good there\n\ni want to replace the fence this summer but i'm also nervous i'm gonna start doing it and they'll tell me i need to switch it to a 4 foot since the pool is long gone, so i might have to do it one section at a time so it's more of a \"repair\" than a \"replace\"",
