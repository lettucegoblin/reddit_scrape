I'm ready to leave.\n\nEdit 3: Hey, Jack Off, looks like it might rain. You better come get me soon.\n\nEdit 4: This is a pretty dodgy neighborhood, Jackminster Fullerine, you need to come get me immediately.\n\nEdit 5: Where the fuck are you, Blackjack Mulligan? It's now raining.\n\nEdit 6: Hey, Bojack Horse's Ass. Two punks just stole my messenger bag. Where the hell are you?\n\nEdit 7: What the fuck, Jack Sparrow, I'm going to beat your ass. Come. Get. Me. Now.\n\nEdit 8: Hey, Jackjack, it's INCREDIBLE, that you're not here yet. What's your ETA?\n\nEdit 9: Yo, New Jack City, those punks came back for my wallet and roughed me up a little. You really need to hurry your ass up.\n\nEdit 10: Yo, Jackalope, I was just talking a piss and thought I felt my phone vibrate. Was that you? Anyway, pick me up.\n\nEdit 11: Those punks came back again and now I've been stabbed fairly badly. We may need to stop at an Urgent Care. Jack.\n\nEdit 12: You are in for a world of pain when you finally get here, dijack_snow. So hurry up and get it over with.\n\nEdit 13: Jack jack jackjackjackjackjackjackjackjackkackjackjackjackjackkack\n\nEdit 14: I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing, Jacktoberfest, but if you're not here in the next five minutes I might get an Uber or a taxi or an ambulance.\n\n~~Edit 15: OK. John. I know your name. I'm sorry for the way that I have behaved and I really need your help. Please. Please. I need a ride. I'm hurt real bad. Please. John.~~   \n  \nEdit 16: Really, Snap, Jackle, Pop? You're still not here. I'm furious. I'm bleeding out. I am seriously considering getting a Lyft. I decided I don't approve of Uber's business practices.\n\nEdit 17: I'm getting pretty light headed out here, Jacky Tacky Tavi. I might not make it. I've lost a lot of blood and I'm drinking rain from a puddle. Tell your wife I love her.\n\nEdit 18: So... Are you close or what, Jacklemore?  \n  \nEdit 19: Jackass.\n\nEdit 20: Yo, Jackuzzi, I still need you to pick me up. The Lyft driver wouldn't let me in the car because he didn't want to get blood on the seats. He said Lyft would pay to get it cleaned and charge me but there's a ton of paperwork and he wouldn't be able to drive until after he got it cleaned so that's money out of his pocket. So I'm still here. Come get me.   \n  \nEdit 21: It's getting really late, Jacksonville. I hope you're already almost here. Bortles!",
