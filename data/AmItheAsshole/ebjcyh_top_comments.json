You could argue a YTA with this.\n\nHowever, \"it's the thought that counts\" shows the true nature, perhaps the politics as well, of gift giving. People look through the gifts others give to see the good will underneath. The phrase unables people to share their good will without having to suffer selfish criticism, as the act of giving in itself represents good, especially if some mistake has occured. \nYet, you can equally infer that \"a person's gift shows how much they thought of me\". Because if its the thought that counts, how do you count it?\n\nIf two people are thought of equally, then they should be treated similarly. In your particular case I assume that it was obvious you and your sibling both would have liked a car, that you both \"seemed\" to want one, that you aren't some lifeless basement dweller. Cars, especially in countries where driving is the main form of transportation, represent and enable independance. It should be seen that there are alot of underlying thoughts that are considered when getting someone a car, other than its price.\n\nIt can be simply said that your gifts are unfair when compared, but i hope you can see why you are clearly right in it being unfair. By comparing the gifts, you compare the underlying thoughts of the giver. You don't need to ignore the fact that what you recieve is a gift to see that this is unequal treatment, especially because of the type of gift.\n\n\n\nOn another note, while it would be nice to say how big the disparity in value between gifts is isn't necessarily what the problem is, the fact that you are a family makes it important.\n\nChildren rely on their parents to enable them, to love and care for them, and to pass on their assets into the future to better them. The above argument discusses mostly how much they care, but the reality of your situation specifically  has to do with them acting as your parents [and failing]. We aren't in the dark ages where parents pick their first born as prime inheritor, however it seems the clich\u00e9 of stepmother pulling the father away to be relevant.\n\nI feel stupid having to say this, but you need to asses how your dad really feels. We don't always pay attention to our parents relationships, but it is a fact that people can grow distant and be pulled away from their children by \"new family\". Your stepmother probably gives less shit about you then her kid, and not all parents are proactive in spending on their kids, which may lead to your outcome of the stepmother pushing for spending on her kid while your dad just wasn't thinking that hard on the consequences on you while continuing his merry way on otherwise reasonable child spending (on you).",

My parents paid for her car entirely, and it was obviously a bit nicer and more expensive than my car. \n\nWhen my sister came to school here, she didn\u2019t want to bring her car because it embarrasses her to drive it (keep in mind, it\u2019s a lot better than my car but it\u2019s a Suzuki so she doesn\u2019t like it). My parents were like ok, lets go buy you a new car. \n\nI was pissed, I have a much worse car and I\u2019m 4 years older than her and I\u2019ve had many jobs in my life while she hasn\u2019t ever had a job. I was super mad so my parents gave in and said we could share the car. \n\nThey got us a brand new 2019 Honda Civic.

My sister was being slow to give it to me on the fourth week, I was supposed to get it Sunday before that week starts but she just kept having a reason for needing the car on my week. \n\nOn Monday she tells me she got a massive stain on the passenger seat that needs cleaned. I\u2019m like ok I can get it cleaned not a big deal. \n\nOn Tuesday she totaled the car in an accident that was her fault. \n\nThe ownership of the car was in my name, the insurance of the car was in my name. My parents said they did this so I could build credit even though I wasn\u2019t paying for those things.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even surprised by the accident, those dents I have in my 2005 Hyundai are also because of my sister. \n\nKeep in mind, I have a perfect driving record.

My mom took me to see Star Wars,when it first came out. She spent the entire movie ridiculing it,really loudly in the theater. It was awful.

As for college,my sister and I paid for out first year. During the summer after that,my dad got a much better job,and we lost all our financial aid. My parents told us they could only afford to pay the tuition for one of us,and thought that since my sister knew what she wanted to be,a teacher for disabled kids,and I hadn't decided yet, that she should get her tuition paid,not me. I was a science major,I just hadn't decided on a specialty yet. She stayed in college,and I had to drop out. She dropped out halfway through her fourth year and never graduated.

        "body": "This is going to sound nuts, and it's probably anecdotal, but I have seen this type of thing *so many times* where the children of the dad in the new relationship get treated worse than the children of the stepmom.\n\nIt's the exact experience I had when growing up, and I noticed the same seemed to be true for a lot of my friends.  For some reason men seem to not want to stand up to the women in the relationship when it comes to her children being treated better.\n\nI experienced this exact same pattern from the time I was 8 all the way into adulthood.  I wanted to play in band in 6th grade, but my mom said it would only be possible if my dad and stepmom helped pay for the instrument.  They didn't help, so I didn't get to play in band.  The very next year, they bought my stepsister a brand new saxophone.  The same thing happened when it was time to drive.  I had to get a job and buy my own car, pay for insurance.  They bought my stepsisters cars.  They also babysat for both of them the entire time their kids were growing up, I couldn't even begin to calculate what that is worth.  Must've been nice never having to pay for childcare.\n\nMy ex fiance' tried pulling the same kind of crap with her kids and my daughter.  The only difference was, I had enough backbone to stand up for my daughter and let it be known that the unfair bullshit wasn't going to fly.  I broke off the engagement two years ago because she wouldn't stop.\n\nMixed families are *very* hard.  But it really does seem like it's always the dad's kids in these relationships getting shit on.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is going to sound nuts, and it&#39;s probably anecdotal, but I have seen this type of thing <em>so many times</em> where the children of the dad in the new relationship get treated worse than the children of the stepmom.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the exact experience I had when growing up, and I noticed the same seemed to be true for a lot of my friends.  For some reason men seem to not want to stand up to the women in the relationship when it comes to her children being treated better.</p>\n\n<p>I experienced this exact same pattern from the time I was 8 all the way into adulthood.  I wanted to play in band in 6th grade, but my mom said it would only be possible if my dad and stepmom helped pay for the instrument.  They didn&#39;t help, so I didn&#39;t get to play in band.  The very next year, they bought my stepsister a brand new saxophone.  The same thing happened when it was time to drive.  I had to get a job and buy my own car, pay for insurance.  They bought my stepsisters cars.  They also babysat for both of them the entire time their kids were growing up, I couldn&#39;t even begin to calculate what that is worth.  Must&#39;ve been nice never having to pay for childcare.</p>\n\n<p>My ex fiance&#39; tried pulling the same kind of crap with her kids and my daughter.  The only difference was, I had enough backbone to stand up for my daughter and let it be known that the unfair bullshit wasn&#39;t going to fly.  I broke off the engagement two years ago because she wouldn&#39;t stop.</p>\n\n<p>Mixed families are <em>very</em> hard.  But it really does seem like it&#39;s always the dad&#39;s kids in these relationships getting shit on.</p>\n</div>",

But I\u2019m trying to put all of my energy and focus into my degree right now, and then graduate and get a job. I don\u2019t need him on my back harping me about it, I know what I\u2019m doing and I would hate to waste all this money on college and flunk out because all my time and energy is being consumed by my job. So I\u2019m in a bind where I rely on them for a lot, and I don\u2019t see myself getting out of that until I\u2019m making and saving money at a real job after college.</p>\n</div>",

I chose to live with him (long story - didn't get along with my mom) and his first serious girlfriend after the divorce tried to pull crap like that with her kids. She would complain about every little thing my sister and I did with my dad, make him feel like crap over buying us school clothes or taking us out to eat. He would always include her two children in family outings, but she would whine that they never got to do anything \"as a family\" - without us. She expected him to contribute to her kids financially but she wasn't willing to do the same for us, and even belittled him for asking to spend jointly and evenly on presents and such.  She was very cold to us and acted like we were a major inconvenience.  \n\n\nMy dad ended up dumping her over it and he didn't try dating again until I had moved out.

Favorite out of everyone in the world basically, she loves me more than my cousins, more than my sibling and more than her own children.... and she makes is damn clear and always have! So that was fun growing up in. Guess how well my mom and aunt handled the fact that their mother loved me more than them? I you guess not super great you get a cookie! And everyone is like \u201cyou have it sooo great! Grandma loves you and gives you everything!\u201d Yeah, and everyone else hates me, including my own god damn mother! For every $1 someone else get, I get $2. And it\u2019s just not money and things. Grandma doesn\u2019t like physical contact and don\u2019t handle it well, but she always hugs me and always have, I\u2019m the only one she hugs. She always gave me more of everything, gifts, love, attention, time, understanding. And my parents tried compensating my brothers. I get it now, but as a five year old it\u2019s kind of hard to understand why mommy gives your brothers more time and love and affection. And they didn\u2019t forgive me for being grandmas favorite just because they were mom\u2019s. I honestly don\u2019t think that they ever even realised how they are being favoritized by our parents. But they still give me shit for being grandmas favorite, of course.",
