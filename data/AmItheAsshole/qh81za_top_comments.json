If her kids get taken away, then there was a LOT more going on other than this incident and you accidentally uncovered something that may have saved the kids\u2019 lives. People cannot just vindictively sic CPS on people and get them punished, that is not how the system works.</p>\n</div>",

She asks me to watch the twins one night and said that she was going out with a friend and they'd be back around 11. I put the twins to bed but they didn't want to sleep and were crying for their mom until midnight so I put them in her bed thinking it would help. I'd called her a few times at that point but she didn't answer. It's now 1 am, two hours past when she said she'd be back. I called my mom to ask what to do and she said to call 911 to ask if anyone matching J's description had been in an accident or checked in at a hospital-- no luck there. My older sister had a friend over so mom sent them to stay with me and help with the kids. 3 am rolls around and J and her friend finally come home. They had been at a party at my aunt and uncle's house (same neighborhood) and my uncle told her that I was fine and to not worry about my calls. \n\nI told J that I did call 911 just because I was worried and didn't know what else to do because she was hours late coming home and not answering her phone, and she absolutely lost her shit on me for \"overreacting\". After that I was only allowed to pet sit her dog when the family went out of town. I got home at 3:30 am and that was the only single time during my teenage years that I slept past noon the next day. \n\nOh and for bonus points-- this all happened after I had been out kayaking with my family all day and I was extremely sunburned and way past exhausted.",

Flat out, end of story, NTA.  \n\nI used to babysit in my teens (starting at an age that was kind of inappropriate ngl), and by the age of 15 I\u2019d had a good amount of experience accrued.  I started babysitting from a couple newly emigrated from France for their two girls, a 10 month old and a toddler.  After the first two times I babysat for them, they just flat out stopped coming home at the time they told me they would.  While this was in my hometown, I was too young to have a car and relied on them to get me home.  On multiple occasions I would end up getting a call from my mom on my cell, which was one of those Nokia bricks I was told was strictly for emergency use only, with her asking me where the hell I was.  They never responded to my attempts at contacting them, and when they\u2019d get home, they would dismiss my stress over the time and shush me before the husband drove me home.  The last time I ever babysat for them they came home at almost 1 in the morning, and the husband drove me home despite my protests that he was clearly drunk.  Looking back now I so wish I had had the presence of mind to do what you did. It\u2019s never okay to do that to people you\u2019re literally paying to watch your children, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a babysitter to put their literal life on hold past the agreed upon end time.",

They never responded to my attempts at contacting them, and when they\u2019d get home, they would dismiss my stress over the time and shush me before the husband drove me home.  The last time I ever babysat for them they came home at almost 1 in the morning, and the husband drove me home despite my protests that he was clearly drunk.  Looking back now I so wish I had had the presence of mind to do what you did. It\u2019s never okay to do that to people you\u2019re literally paying to watch your children, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect a babysitter to put their literal life on hold past the agreed upon end time.</p>\n</div>",

Is she doing drugs/getting drunk? Wtf is she doing that she's coming home at 3 am when she says 9 pm?

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n \n\nI (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to \"brunch\" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.\n\nOn Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying \"Hey, I'm staying out until x time\", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed.\n\nI am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed.\n\nThe next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again. She asked if her potentially losing her kids was worth me being petty.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is one family I definitely should&#39;ve fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don&#39;t have another job, it&#39;s easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I&#39;d go babysit so she could go to &quot;brunch&quot; but she&#39;d be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she&#39;d start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn&#39;t even call to tell me, she&#39;d just stay out.</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she&#39;s not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I&#39;m pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she&#39;s not home in the next hour, I&#39;m considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying &quot;Hey, I&#39;m staying out until x time&quot;, I would&#39;ve stayed. I don&#39;t know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can&#39;t call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line).

That is in act bad. And the fact she didn't know that you were going to and then did call the cops after you sent her messages means that she didn't even check them. Her kids could have been in the hospital and she wouldn't know. You could have been in the hospital and her kids have no one and she wouldn't know. She choose to abandon her children on you and lie about it, then she choose to ignore the important information you were giving her about her children's welfare and location. \n\nDon't you think the father of these children has a right to know she is doing this? She's a bad parent. Don't cover for bad parents, kids suffer. This is also a pattern of behavior for her. That means she is regularly abandoning her children and refusing to be in contact with other people likely as well. Some might just leave and not worry about calling the cops. Some might dump them with a stranger she dosen't know when they have to leave. What she is doing is reckless with her children's welfare, and her children's father deserves to know. At least one parent who actually cares about these kids should be aware of what is going on. And yeah, CPS should be aware. \n\nAlso, she intentionally was screwing you over. You don't owe her 6 extra hours of babysitting while she ignores you just so she won't get in trouble for trying to screw you.\n\nI'd side eye your friend who thinks you should cover for parents who neglect their kids. In my experience, it's very hard to get CPS to remove children and it does not happen too much but not enough. (Speaking as someone who has worked with abused kids and in mandated reporter jobs.) She won't lose her kids over just this, but yeah sure maybe she's an awful parent who dosen't care about or properly care for her children in other ways and they might notice. But then, the kids would be better off with dad. For all we know she wants custody time for the child support money to party with friends. I've seen some sad excuses for parents.",

I always ask them a standard battery of questions, but I also tell them that I will absolutely every note/page they leave for me, so if there's anything extra they think I should know, add it to the notes. I do the very same thing on the rare occasion I need to go out of town.\n\nOh my god I would be so crushed if anyone described my cat \"inconsolable\" lol. That paints such an adorable, pitiful picture.",
