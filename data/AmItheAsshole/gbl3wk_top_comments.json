Your parents are very much TA's because they're giving him special treatment, even though he's no longer a child and doesn't need it, what he needs is to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nMy older brother is the one with Asperger's, I feel for him in a lot of ways because he has a much harder time socially and has no friends. I know from when he did have friends and partners that he treated them very well, but for the majority of my life he was abusive, angry and unreasonable, his anger issues still pop up every now and then, but overall he's changed quite a big in the last few years. He's about to turn 26 and my parents still treat him like he's 10 and give special treatment, they always make excuses for his behaviour (except my mom is the one that actually acknowledges the abuse, my dad does not and makes excuses for him). I know from so many experiences how frustrating it can be, I know when they're adolescents that they do need more help, but they get help so they can adapt to the neuro-typical world, so they should no longer be coddled beyond a certain age, unless their Asperger's is low functioning. I'm the only one who tells it like it is with my brother, him and my parents don't appreciate it, but he needs to be made aware of these things, or he'll never make a conscious effort to make a change. Your parents need to take responsibility and realize he's not a child anymore, in my opinion, you did the right thing here, kudos to you.",

Once I was diagnosed, I was able to start therapy to learn how to see the world from my new reality.\n\nAutistics who are diagnosed early in life, like your brother, sometimes do get coddled and told they're awesome and special (often parents seem to want to overcompensate for their kid's autism by telling them how amazing they are). And although every kid is awesome - mine are fabulous - they're also people and every person faces times in his/her life when he/she is NOT the most fantastic human in the room.

I made sure my kids learned it early, while I love them immensely, others will not and they will have to earn respect and make their own ways in life (FTR my kids are neurotypical).\n\nSo having not been diagnosed as a child, rather as an older adult, I think I was mostly successful learning the ways of the world and that I was *not* special, as neurotypical children do. I learned to mask, to make eye contact, and to behave as neurotypicals do, because that's what was expected.\n\nIn my biased opinion, I think being diagnosed as an adult is better for most higher functioning autistic kids, because there are lessons in life that we ALL need to learn, not just those of us that are neurotypical. How to behave around other people, members of the opposite sex, etc. are all a part of that.

That doesn't come with being autistic, and it's an insult to autism to say that it is. You can say: \"You're acting like it's better for you to be confident and completely unaware of the effect of your behavior, which is not at all logical. Instead, you can look at what the problem is and change that behavior.

He's 13 mentally but 9 in some areas so I guess that's low functioning for an 18 year old. \n\nThis kid has the worst mouth I've ever heard and is the most spoiled and entitled kid I've ever met. He has literally zero responsibilities and gets EVERYTHING handed to him. There are companies in my city that hire disabled people yet he has literally said verbatim that he won't work because he doesn't want to. \n\nHe gets away with murder. I've heard him call his grandmother a bitch, a whore etc just for simple things like her telling him to take a shower because he smells. He'll go an entire week without showering or wearing deodorant.\n\nHe gets take out every single day no exaggeration because he will rarely eat at home. I get that people with autism have behavior issues and food aversions but this is extreme. I think it's more a case of lack of discipline and never being told no and having everything handed to him on a silver platter.\n\nI've never disliked a child before him. I just feel like the whole situation is insane. Anyway, it's probably the same thing with your brother but likely with a bit of narcissism thrown in. Childhood emotional neglect causes it but so does being the \"golden child\". This is cases like your brother and parents. The child is treated like they can do no wrong therefore the result is someone with an inflated sense of self. \n\nMy advice to you is to stay out of it as much as you can because this far in it's unlikely to change. Just leave the house whenever possible and when you turn 18 run like Hell. \n\nI removed myself from the household and my life is soooo much better. In the meantime, talk to a teacher or another adult about the situation. I don't know if guidance counselors are still available with the current global state but if so, start there. In the future just tell your brother that you would rather stay out of his affairs. Sorry I can't offer better advice, just speaking from experience. Good luck hun.",

Now I hope we all know how shitty that particular neurotypical convention is to women and hopefully, it gets better.

Women can be difficult for autistic people because they&#39;re often discouraged from expressing themselves directly. We (women, not autistics) are expected to have a &quot;softer manner&quot; and girls are encouraged to not be direct. You and your sisters were on the receiving end of this, only on steroids. Now I hope we all know how shitty that particular neurotypical convention is to women and hopefully, it gets better. But it also creates a big divide between autistic people and woman folk (or any indirect talker), because by not giving out information directly, you&#39;re effectively disabling the autistic person from connecting with you. Your brother needs and wants <em>direct information</em>.</p>\n</div>",

You gave him exactly what he needs to have ... KNOWLEDGE.  And hopefully he\u2019s better than my son, and will accept it ... and even further than that .... I hope your parents are willing to back you up, to really make it work.</p>\n\n<p>He will only be happy once he solves this issue ... and only the TRUTH about his behavior will help him do that.</p>\n\n<p>GOOD FOR YOU!!!</p>\n</div>",

My partner and my brother are extremely different. My partner was taught how to treat people and my brother was treated very much like op's brother. \n\nMy brother had a gf for several years and he treated her like his maid. He even refused to go to two weddings in her family because he had something else he'd rather do. I wasn't surprised when she left but my mother blamed everything on her and my brother now believes he had zero fault. He now has another gf who believes he can't be held accountable for anything because it's all because he's on the spectrum. He's now virtually cut off everyone in the family.\n\nMy partner isn't perfect but neither am I. We have our clashes now and then. He however is very respectful of me. If I need help then helps with no complaint. He regularly thanks me for what I do around the house. I do all the cleaning because I like cleaning and he works while I don't. If we disagree on something we often try to work out a compromise. Do have to remind him now and then that things may be obvious to him but they aren't always to others lol.\n\nAnyway my point is that just because someone in on the spectrum doesn't mean that they can't learn how to be a functional and decent human being. By being honest with her brother OP was helping him. He needs people to be honest about his behaviour otherwise he's just going to wind up alone and miserable. Seriously NTA",

The issue I think some people have between the colloquial (non-medical) use of the terms \u201chigh and low functioning\u201d is that the people using them try and break that spectrum down into clearly defined categories that just aren\u2019t there.\n\nFor example, both myself and an old friend of mine are \u201con the spectrum.\u201d We are both considered \u201chigh functioning\u201d medically speaking, meaning we are verbal and capable of advanced interactions with others. However, our situations could not be more different. Most people don\u2019t realize I\u2019m on the spectrum, just that I\u2019m pretty odd. It\u2019s impossible to miss my friend\u2019s autism.

While he can memorize and regurgitate more facts than anyone I know, he can\u2019t really draw abstract connections between those facts. \n\nAdditionally, the high vs low functioning distinction is also a spectrum within itself in my experience. I have moments and even longer periods of time when I just can\u2019t deal. Slapping me socially with the \u201chigh functioning\u201d label tends to make people think this is some kind of moral failing on my part.

I've just had a conflict with a friend who blew up at me for pressuring her to sacrifice her comfort around a hobby when I'd totally thought she'd been an equally enthusiastic participant. She's now talking about quitting, and it's been super destabilising and scary just how differently we've perceived things. Now I've got a word for what was going on.\n\n2. I was really into feminism years ago, and still think it's great and good, but wow, you're completely right about how one half of the explanation is missing. Right now, I'm thinking that the martyr complex is part of why patriarchy is being upheld? Specifically the pressuring of others to sacrifice as much as you have, lest your sacrifices be in vain?\n\nLots to think about.
