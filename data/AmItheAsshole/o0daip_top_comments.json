That is a truly despicable behavior and I really hope you are able to salvage them in some way.\n\nWith that being said, I think Eva needs help and guidance to get her onto the right path. Even though Eva is 20, she seems to be not in control of her emotions at all and seems to be incredibly reckless. Her actions were absolutely horrible and teenage-me can relate to her more than I\u2019d like to admit.\n\nWhen I was about 15-16, I treated my family very very poorly on a routine schedule. I would absolutely sob or go into full-blown viscous attacks at the drop of a hat. I would become violent and volatile. If someone did anything that felt out of line, even a little bit, I would have a complete breakdown and do whatever I could in my power to hurt the other person. \n\nThe worst part was, I didn\u2019t even realize how insane and irrational my thinking became until AFTER the episode ended. When it was over, I would be in total shock that I acted the way I did and promised myself that I would never let that happen again, but it would happen, every time, like clockwork. I was so confused about my behavior because I was NOT that person 75% of the time. It seemed like those episodes would only last for a week or so and then I would feel normal again.\n\nI think the expected emotions to feel after acting so erratically would be guilt or shame, but I felt so scared because that was so out of character for me. I consider myself to be a very logical person. I always make decisions using my head instead of my heart. But during these weeks, I had absolutely no control over my emotions and I didn\u2019t even realize how horrid I would become.\n\nThankfully, my mom was keeping a close eye on me and realized I only acted this way the week before my period started for that month. I was only a sophomore in high school at the time and truly didn\u2019t have the insight at that time to realize it was happening on a schedule like that. Once she told me she thought it was period-related, I scoffed it off and thought she was being overdramatic because I always heard that people with periods became \u201coverly emotional\u201d during their time of the month. I just assumed that every person with a period became that emotional or unhinged the week before they started menstruating.\n\nMy mom assured me that wasn\u2019t the case and made me an appointment for an OBGYN. I really had no choice but to go, so begrudgingly and with a huge eye-roll, I went. I was so confident that the OBGYN was going to dismiss my mom\u2019s concerns as normal, but to my surprise, she handed me a pamphlet on something called Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Of course, I had never heard of PMDD before, but everything rang so true to me.\n\nSoon after, I was put on a birth control pill that my OBGYN said should regulate my hormones and it worked like a charm. I\u2019m 22 now and in the seven years I have been on the pill, I have only had serious outbursts when I\u2019ve been late picking up my prescription.\n\nI say all of this because Eva\u2019s ability to destroy those precious letters in one moment and then to cry and scream when she\u2019s faced with a reasonable consequence feels very reminiscent of how I acted prior to my PMDD diagnosis.\n\nOf course this could be related to a slew of other mental health issues. I don\u2019t know if you have a close enough or comfortable enough relationship with your daughter to know when she\u2019s on her period or if you\u2019ve seen any of the warning signs that my mom saw, but I can\u2019t recommend looking into PMDD enough.",

I fully encourage OP to help Eva get the help she needs, but he also has to think about not only his own emotional wellbeing but that of his other two children as well.\n\nThis is key.\n\nWhen I was young I moved back in with my parents. I got a job that I wasn't qualified for and, about six months later, got reluctantly let go. My bosses liked me, but they needed a more qualified employee. My parents were already upset I had moved back in with them. Losing my job did not make things better. \n\nThe day I got fired, I ended up getting into an argument with my mother. My father sat quietly, saying nothing for a while. But then he started sniping me. Not contributing anything to our argument. Just taking cheap shots. It got the better of me and I blurted out, \"Fuck you, prick.\" \n\nMy father had a very short temper when it came to that kind of thing and immediately got up and came at me. He probably would have hit me if my mother hadn't stopped him. My father told me to get out of the house. My mother told me to go to my room and she would talk to me later. She came up about an hour later and explained that I had the weekend (it was Friday) and then had to find a new place to live.\n\nShe said she would help with everything, but I could not be there anymore. I actually came up with an idea. I didn't have enough money for my own place, but did have enough for a trade class that would help me get a job. I went to my father on Sunday and told him that I had an idea and to please hear me out. He reluctantly agreed. I explained that I would use my money to take the two week course and, that if after another two weeks I would find a job and get a place.\n\nHe said no. Get out now.\n\nI explained that if I didn't fulfill my end of the bargain, I'd join the Marines (he was a former Marine and prouder of that than pretty much anything else in his life). \n\nHe agreed.\n\nMy parents stood by their decision to kick me out. But they supported me in getting on my own two feet. It ended up taking close to six weeks before I was out (after the two week training, a week to find a job and three to get a paycheck) but within six weeks of that terrible weekend, My father was understanding of the delay due to circumstance and the fact that I was following through with my promise.  Two months later, he was over at my new place helping me install my vertical blinds on my windows. And for the next 20 years, we had a great relationship, before he passed away.\n\nMy parents never once reconsidered having me leave. I would say that they let me stay as long as they did (close to a year after moving back in) only enabled me to do as little as possible. Getting kicked out, but with support, drove me find a work ethic and really be mu own best advocate. That progress wasn't immediate. But that's where it started.\n\nu/ProfessionalSandal, if you even read this, kicking your daughter could very well be one of the best things you do for her. But you have to be supportive and never stop showing love, as difficult as that may seem.",

Since Charlie is a minor and can't go anywhere else, you have to come down on the side of protecting Charlie.

What she did, making a transphobic slur and destroying those precious letters from your wife, is so heinous that I don't know if I could fully forgive it (if I were you.)

I sort of nodded and then brushed it off as irrelevant to me. But then I did end up in crisis and shopping for a therapist who fit and who was a help was so exhausting and hard and almost hurtful at points. I remembered what my friend had told me though and I kept at it (with my wife\u2019s exponential help) and finally found a therapist who clicked with me. I am no longer in crisis and haven\u2019t been in crisis for a couple years.

I sort of nodded and then brushed it off as irrelevant to me. But then I did end up in crisis and shopping for a therapist who fit and who was a help was so exhausting and hard and almost hurtful at points. I remembered what my friend had told me though and I kept at it (with my wife\u2019s exponential help) and finally found a therapist who clicked with me. I am no longer in crisis and haven\u2019t been in crisis for a couple years.

Im definitely going to be doing the same as you and staying on top of maintenance appointments but thats way in the future ive got a lot of work to do first.</p>\n</div>",

Using them as excuses is a very toxic thing to do because at the end of the day you still have to make the decision to go through with it.</p>\n</div>",

The comment you replied to before mine wasnt saying that it isnt their responsibility either. Just offering a possibly explanation. Explanation =/= responsibility.</p>\n</div>",
