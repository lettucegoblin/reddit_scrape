At first, when she got him alone and started crying while trying to explain why she was so hurt and humiliated, he did this resentful, obviously begrudging, \"Okay, fine! I'm sorry! There, I said it. Now are you happy?\" Then when every anniversary would end in tears, despite her desperate efforts to forgive & forget, he would say, \"I already apologized! What else do you want from me?!\" (He sounded exactly like Napoleon Dynamite.)\n\nWhat saved their marriage was the marriage counseling retreats that they go to every year.

Everything before this was an act. If he was so respectful of you and his friends or someone else talked him into it, he would have explained that, apologized, begged your forgiveness. </p>\n\n<p>He didn&#39;t do that. He took full ownership of the act, ignored that he promised you he wouldn&#39;t do something and did it, told you your feelings on the matter don&#39;t matter at all, and that you should just move on and be happy as his new bride. </p>\n\n<p>Do not be surprised when this kind of behavior starts occurring more often now that you&#39;re married and he &quot;got you&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

As far as the cake smashing goes, we were both of a similar mind that neither of us really likes it. The most we were willing to tolerate was a dab of frosting on the tip of the nose. BUT, where we disagree is on dipping (like...in a dance situation, not in a chips-and-salsa situation). He's fine with dipping, I absolutely hate it. I just...well, I'm super awkward when being dipped. It doesn't look nice or romantic or dramatic. It looks like an awkward, uncomfortable woman being held in the air by a guy who's just doing his best. As we were parting ways before the ceremony, our photographer said \"when the preacher says to kiss her, give her a nice, deep dip at the same time.\" It didn't really register what he'd said until my spouse had already walked away. So when the preacher said \"Kiss the bride,\" I quickly whispered \"please don't dip me.\" And you know what? He fucking didn't. He whispered back \"duh,\" kissed me, and that was it. We've been married almost 13 years. Rock solid relationship.\n\nSecond, my sister and her spouse. Now, the story of my sister's wedding is...well...fucking sad, to be honest. We woke up to get ready for the wedding to find that my dad had died overnight. The spouse pressed to continue with the wedding and my sister was too out of it to really question that. So, even though it was her wedding day, my sister was obviously having one of the worst days of her entire life and needed people who loved her and supported her around her. When the cake came out, she said (loud enough for everyone crowded around them to hear) \"Just don't smash it in my face.\" The guy smirked, said \"of course,\" and smashed it in her face. They went home and he completely changed who he was. He was screaming at her because she wasn't happy and joking around with him (again, our dad died that morning). He was telling her \"you belong to me now.\" He flipped out when she said something about visiting her family for the holidays (they aren't your family anymore, my family is your family). My mom had come to stay the night with them because she was so distraught that her spouse had died, so this was all in my mother's presence. When she intervened, he got in her face and told her to get the fuck out of their business or get the fuck out of his house. This was all on night 1. It got worse from there. She stuck it out for a year or two before she finally got the courage to end it. \n\nNow, obviously, I don't think your husband is going to escalate to the level of my former brother-in-law. But...he didn't show you very much respect. And that he's doubling down instead of actually listening to you and apologizing for what he did is kind of infuriating, too. You aren't wrong to feel wronged!",
