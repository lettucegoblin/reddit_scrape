I understand why your girlfriend may have felt some type of way about this situation...however, she needed to address her concerns to you directly, not verbally attack a vulnerable, grieving 15 year old. \n\nAssuming you\u2019re American, it\u2019s abnormal in our culture for brothers or male friends to cuddle. But abnormal =/= bad, wrong, or unhealthy. In many other cultures, this would be normal, everyday behavior. \n\nI agree with everyone who said that if it was sisters or female friends, that no one would even bat an eye. I (25F) cuddle with my female cousins  and friends and sometimes my male friends if we\u2019re on the couch watching a movie or sleeping over at each other\u2019s houses after a party or something. Affection can be totally platonic and non sexual. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a Californian, so at least where I live it\u2019s perfectly normal for guys to be shirtless in their own homes especially if they\u2019re just hanging out, watching tv, sleeping etc. \n\nNothing about your story seems that weird to me. It\u2019s totally plausible that a 15 year old kid would be hanging around his own house shirtless and then fall asleep cuddling up to his older brother while watching tv. \nSome people on this thread seem to think it\u2019s wrong or unacceptable but I think it\u2019s all just their perception based on cultural norms. At the end of the day, you know your relationship with your brother and what feels right or wrong.",

We grew up with lots of love and affection.  My mom and I always slept on the same bed on vacations, my mom will still sleep with me in my bed when she visits (it\u2019s rude to make her sleep on a couch), my dad and I used to share a hotel room when we would take out dad/daughter yearly trip.  </p>\n\n<p>My dad died recently.  He died at home. My mom had a queen bed next to his hospital bed.  When he was passing, all of us would lay in bed next to him so he wouldn\u2019t be alone. </p>\n\n<p>OPs poor brother lost his parents a a young age, he doesn\u2019t have anyone else to give him love and affection but OP. OP is doing what he can to make his brother feel loved and part of that is physical comfort.  GF making it out to be gross and inappropriate is super offensive. She has no idea what it\u2019s like to have no mom or dad to give you hugs or comfort you when you\u2019re upset.  It\u2019s traumatic as a 35yo, I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for a 15yo.</p>\n</div>",
