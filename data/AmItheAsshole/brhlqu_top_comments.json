Not to mention that sometimes, when \"No\" isn't listened to, being crude is the most effective way of getting them to stop.

I am sure her gestures came from a good place.

I can definitely understand being upset that none of the guests were OP's friends and how OP told his mom about not having a party, but come on, OP is 20, he could have done so much better. \n\nLately the posts in this sub screams *self-centeredness* at me and it's always \"it was their responsibility\", \"it's your right\", \"your choice\". In many cases, yes, it is your right and your choice, but by doing so you are being an asshole. Is it your right to not want to linger at the party? Of course it is, but by not doing so you just hurt your mum's feelings, made her look bad in front of a dozen of people and wasted all her efforts. All the NTA's I saw just threw family relationships out of the window saying she's narcissistic before they considered the mother's standpoint. There's even a comment having 200 downvotes just for a sentence saying that OP could've considered mom's feelings.",

I still cannot fathom how people are judging him NTA saying &quot;it&#39;s <em>your</em> birthday, she went against your wishes, you should&#39;ve gotten what you wanted etc.&quot; when he just walked out of a birthday party thrown together for him like that. Obviously the mom had spent time planning the party, in the end just to be ignored completely by OP? I&#39;d be devastated. I can definitely understand being upset that none of the guests were OP&#39;s friends and how OP told his mom about not having a party, but come on, OP is 20, he could have done so much better. </p>\n\n<p>Lately the posts in this sub screams <em>self-centeredness</em> at me and it&#39;s always &quot;it was their responsibility&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s your right&quot;, &quot;your choice&quot;. In many cases, yes, it is your right and your choice, but by doing so you are being an asshole. Is it your right to not want to linger at the party? Of course it is, but by not doing so you just hurt your mum&#39;s feelings, made her look bad in front of a dozen of people and wasted all her efforts. All the NTA&#39;s I saw just threw family relationships out of the window saying she&#39;s narcissistic before they considered the mother&#39;s standpoint. There&#39;s even a comment having 200 downvotes just for a sentence saying that OP could&#39;ve considered mom&#39;s feelings.</p>\n</div>",
