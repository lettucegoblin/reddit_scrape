I have a hard time thinking this was just about \"asthetic\", since a reasonable solution was offered and immediately shut down.

I don't care that she's the bride.  There's a line and I feel like she crossed it.  You can't treat people like you don't want them there and then be all hurt and surprised when they leave.
