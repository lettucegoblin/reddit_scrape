Or whispered behind her back. \nBut I am aware you can&#39;t do that. </p>\n\n<p>Try making her call the cousin beforehand to explain why she will be going in shorts and a t-shirt and see what she says. Damn, that&#39;s bad advice too. </p>\n\n<p>Nevermind, I have no good advice to give you. Just know that you are definitely Not the asshole.</p>\n</div>",

I wasn\u2019t given the option of considering the men\u2019s hanbok or even a dressy shirt with slacks.

My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate. \n\nHowever, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks. \n\nBut, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.\n\nShe got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Socks with seams at the toes, nope.  Anything tight around the waist or neck, bad.  Everything needed to be soft and loose.  They did, however, get used to certain things over time. \n\nThe one glaring example outside of clothing is still an issue. The sound of people chewing. Literally causes anxiety that grows into nausea. Gum is the worst. I still remember them coming home from the first day of kindergarten and complaining about hating lunchtime. It took months before they were able to explain why...and it\u2019s not something you would think of off the bat.  They still eat alone, and I\u2019ve become hyper aware of my own chewing so we can eat meals together without them running from the table. \n\nMy child also has a lot of other issues that we have been dealing with over the years. I posted about some of it somewhere else on this thread.  I am so thankful for the team we have at school and an awesome therapist, without all of them, we would be lost. \n\nYour child might not want to or be ready to talk to you about whatever bigger issue might be underlying. They may be unaware of it themselves or just not have the right words to vocalize it.  I see so many comments on this post saying she is probably just a \u201cbratty teenager\u201d, and what do I know?  That very well be the case.  But if it\u2019s not, and there is something that you are missing (don\u2019t beat yourself up, first if all) it is so important that your kid has someone she can talk to that you both trust.  \n\nI really hope that whatever it is, you work it out.  It\u2019s obvious how much you love your daughter and want to do the right thing and for her to be happy...sometimes taking the first steps to getting there are the hardest steps to take, but with love and trust you can do it!!  Good luck!",

They still eat alone, and I\u2019ve become hyper aware of my own chewing so we can eat meals together without them running from the table. </p>\n\n<p>My child also has a lot of other issues that we have been dealing with over the years. I posted about some of it somewhere else on this thread.  I am so thankful for the team we have at school and an awesome therapist, without all of them, we would be lost. </p>\n\n<p>Your child might not want to or be ready to talk to you about whatever bigger issue might be underlying. They may be unaware of it themselves or just not have the right words to vocalize it.  I see so many comments on this post saying she is probably just a \u201cbratty teenager\u201d, and what do I know?  That very well be the case.  But if it\u2019s not, and there is something that you are missing (don\u2019t beat yourself up, first if all) it is so important that your kid has someone she can talk to that you both trust.  </p>\n\n<p>I really hope that whatever it is, you work it out.  It\u2019s obvious how much you love your daughter and want to do the right thing and for her to be happy...sometimes taking the first steps to getting there are the hardest steps to take, but with love and trust you can do it!!  Good luck!</p>\n</div>",

Soon this will be a moment you will look back and be grateful for the humility lesson.</p>\n</div>",

It's just that with formal wear it's required to pay honour and respect to not only the hosts but the nature of the event as well. Showing up in a tee-shirt and slacks would send the message that she doesn't care about the wedding and the people's love it's meant to celebrate. Sometimes individualism and the collective are at odds with each other. Then we need to decide if it's worth possibly burning a bridge over the conflict. If we constantly put the individual self first that individual isn't well regarded or liked by the group. So we need to pick our battles wisely lest we be disliked and distrusted by the collective over trivial things. \n\nThe mom is NTA in this case BTW. Her daughter does need to go in formal wear and isn't being made to appear feminine. Her daughter needs to be dressed appropriately so she sends the right message to the other guests. She can find a piece of formal wear that works for her, but likely won't be easy. What I am guessing the issue is she isn't feminine so dresses to her feel disingenuous to who she is. At the same time, she doesn't want to be forced into men's wear and crossdress because that's not a part of her either. Formal wear tends to be hyper-feminine, feminine or overtly-masculine. A woman's pantsuit may work. Not all women's pantsuits are androgynous though. She may be ok in a not form-fitting but well fitted one.",

There\u2019s quite a lot of room for self-expression within the constraints of the outfit remaining formal. The impression I get from OP is that she expressed to her daughter that she just wants her to dress formal, period, regardless of how she does it. Within reasonable limits, of course.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d recommend to OP to ask her daughter to look up formalwear looks from people who\u2019s style that she admires, so she can get some ideas about \u201cformalwear but make it FASHION\u201d looks that she can get excited about.</p>\n\n<p>Also NTA</p>\n</div>",
