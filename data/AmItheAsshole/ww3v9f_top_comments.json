But we still do privately wish her a happy birthday on her true day and give her flowers or chocolate. We then all together spend that day remembering the person we lost. True gift we give her on her celebration day. Regarding that super close member to the person that died, they somethimes remember and somethimes don't on the true date and somethimes they come to celebrate and somethimes don't. It's understandable.\n\nThe fact that you marked your birthday only with your significant other on the end of that day is for me a respectful way to yours and hers feelings. As it is just 1 year anniversary I would just let it go with them. I would apologise for a picture and say it was a surprise cake and more like unwinding after a truly hard emotional day. They either need more time or you would have to invite them next year to your quiet small birthday celebration one month later than the actual date (but not on the same date day of next month) so they get used to it and separate it in their hearts. The child was so young, emotions are gonna spill on every member for a long time. Give them space for now. Next year talk with your mother about having a small cake and drinks in the evening few weeks after the birthday.",

But we still do privately wish her a happy birthday on her true day and give her flowers or chocolate. We then all together spend that day remembering the person we lost. True gift we give her on her celebration day. Regarding that super close member to the person that died, they somethimes remember and somethimes don&#39;t on the true date and somethimes they come to celebrate and somethimes don&#39;t. It&#39;s understandable.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you marked your birthday only with your significant other on the end of that day is for me a respectful way to yours and hers feelings. As it is just 1 year anniversary I would just let it go with them. I would apologise for a picture and say it was a surprise cake and more like unwinding after a truly hard emotional day. They either need more time or you would have to invite them next year to your quiet small birthday celebration one month later than the actual date (but not on the same date day of next month) so they get used to it and separate it in their hearts. The child was so young, emotions are gonna spill on every member for a long time. Give them space for now. Next year talk with your mother about having a small cake and drinks in the evening few weeks after the birthday.</p>\n</div>",

Children and grandchildren are an extension of ourselves. For your mom, she lost a grandchild and is also watching her own child suffer the heartbreak of losing a child. \n\nIn grief we say and do things we might otherwise not have.

Its good your sister is in therapy, maybe mom could benefit from some grief and loss services too.\n\n28 years ago I lost my little girl. She was just a baby, only 5 weeks old. The death of a child is likely the most heartbreaking thing to go thru. After she died I was devastated. Everything was hard, all her 1sts that i was missing, seeing other children, smelling baby shampoo, random stuff that wouldn't occur to anyone else would upset me. Months after the funeral I had a meltdown one day at work and had to leave early because they had an office party. Everyone was in the breakroom laughing, talking, eating pizza. My emotions were all over the place and I actually thought to myself 'how dare they'. I knew it was irrational but was hurt they were having a good time while I was struggling to even get out of bed every morning. The world had carried on after my daughter's death, but I hadn't done that yet.\n\nThe sense of loss has never, ever gone away. It changed me, her death took a part of me that has never come back. I still think of her daily, miss her, wonder about who she would be now, what would she look like now and things like that. But in time the shock from her death subsided, the intensity of my grief eased up enough for me to carry on. Eventually i came to the point of acceptance which is probably when I was able to continue living a life not just grieving her death.  Hopefully in time your sister and mom will get there too.\n\nYou are definitely NTA, your sister and mom are still just in the depths of despair.

        "body": "OP NTA.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about death of a child; it *really* fucks with the heads of the parents, grandparents etc.  The first anniversary is HARD.  They\u2019re reliving everything.  Your sister was just reminded that she\u2019s spent 25% of her child\u2019s entire life on this planet without her son.  All the things she wanted for him, all the memories she expected to make, ripped away.  And in another few short years he\u2019ll have spent more time being dead than alive.  Life does go on, but it\u2019s really difficult seeing everyone else return to normal when it all feels so wrong.  And no one notices.  \n\nSo yeah, they were wrong to do that, and you didn\u2019t deserve it.  But reason is the furthest thing from their mind right now.  \n\nNot sure it\u2019ll help, but in case it does I\u2019ll share a personal story.  Several years ago my brother was severely drunk (alcoholism runs in our family unfortunately) and committed suicide.  It completely broke my mother.  She started drinking shots of fireball because that\u2019s what he drank and I guess it somehow made her feel closer to him.  On the first anniversary of his death, we all got together to remember him.  I sent my kid and husband home but stayed behind because I had a feeling it was going to become a shit show somehow, and I rarely drink (saw too much shit when I was little that was alcohol fueled)  so I was sober. \n\nMy mother picked verbal fights with my sister, got belligerent with her granddaughter, told us she was going to lie down in the middle of the night while we sat around a fire but instead polished off a bottle of fireball and the next thing we hear is her voice calling out his name but faint.  We went to investigate and she\u2019s in her nightclothes staggering barefoot down the street hollering for him and became combative when we tried to get her back on her own property at least.  Someone called the cops.  They arrive on scene, we explain the situation, she did have to be restrained and it was a group effort to get her into the ambulance while handcuffed.  I got a call from my other brother that he was getting out of work so I picked him up and brought him to the hospital while our mom sobered up.  In the meantime she said a lot of things to us that were hurtful including admitting that our deceased brother was actually her favorite child.  IT SUCKED.  \n\nMost of us don\u2019t talk to her anymore or have anything to do with her, not because of solely that specific incident but a lot of trauma and things over time. I feel like my brother\u2019s death broke whatever sanity she had left.  Last I knew, she had become a bitter shell of a woman who\u2019d as soon attack her kids as anyone else.  I hope she\u2019s able to find peace someday and part of me still loves her, but as far as I\u2019m concerned my brother took her with him that night. \n\nLong story short, while you\u2019re not TA here, it\u2019s like your sister and your mother are living on a different planet.  They\u2019re lashing out at you likely in part because your nephew will have no more birthdays.  They\u2019re not themselves.  It\u2019s not ok but it\u2019s a human thing to do.\n\nMy suggestion would be to enjoy your life, just make sure they\u2019re blocked from those posts and keep that stuff separate from them.  They will come to terms and heal in their own ways, but they may never be able to celebrate with you again (though I hope they can). It sucks but hope that you never have to know their pain.",

I sent my kid and husband home but stayed behind because I had a feeling it was going to become a shit show somehow, and I rarely drink (saw too much shit when I was little that was alcohol fueled)  so I was sober. </p>\n\n<p>My mother picked verbal fights with my sister, got belligerent with her granddaughter, told us she was going to lie down in the middle of the night while we sat around a fire but instead polished off a bottle of fireball and the next thing we hear is her voice calling out his name but faint.  We went to investigate and she\u2019s in her nightclothes staggering barefoot down the street hollering for him and became combative when we tried to get her back on her own property at least.  Someone called the cops.  They arrive on scene, we explain the situation, she did have to be restrained and it was a group effort to get her into the ambulance while handcuffed.  I got a call from my other brother that he was getting out of work so I picked him up and brought him to the hospital while our mom sobered up.  In the meantime she said a lot of things to us that were hurtful including admitting that our deceased brother was actually her favorite child.  IT SUCKED.  </p>\n\n<p>Most of us don\u2019t talk to her anymore or have anything to do with her, not because of solely that specific incident but a lot of trauma and things over time. I feel like my brother\u2019s death broke whatever sanity she had left.  Last I knew, she had become a bitter shell of a woman who\u2019d as soon attack her kids as anyone else.  I hope she\u2019s able to find peace someday and part of me still loves her, but as far as I\u2019m concerned my brother took her with him that night. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short, while you\u2019re not TA here, it\u2019s like your sister and your mother are living on a different planet.  They\u2019re lashing out at you likely in part because your nephew will have no more birthdays.  They\u2019re not themselves.  It\u2019s not ok but it\u2019s a human thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion would be to enjoy your life, just make sure they\u2019re blocked from those posts and keep that stuff separate from them.  They will come to terms and heal in their own ways, but they may never be able to celebrate with you again (though I hope they can). It sucks but hope that you never have to know their pain.</p>\n</div>",

The first few years we struggled to do anything, but each year we tried to do a little more. It's getting close to 20 years now since my dad died, and I can now have christmas decorations again and tolerate most traditions if children are around, but certain things I'd still rather avoid.

She took our advice after that.)\n\nWhat is absolutely absurd is that some people, like the OP's family are outraged she celebrated the birthday at all.
