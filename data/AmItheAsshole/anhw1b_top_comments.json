If you\u2019re into it, then it\u2019s more likely to be fun for you and good for the guy. Wouldn\u2019t you feel super self conscious getting oral if the guy/girl was obviously not into it and didn\u2019t really care?? My other biggest tip for good oral is to suck on the head and pump the shaft with your hand in a corkscrew motion. Make sure the shaft has some lube (natural or actual lube because a dry hand job can cause nasty friction and hurt him). Most guys go crazy for this. You don\u2019t have to deep throat to be amazing.
