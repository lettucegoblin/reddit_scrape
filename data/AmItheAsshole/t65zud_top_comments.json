        "body": "NTA - I can't recall if I've posted this before, but here goes...\n\nYears back, my sis was in a very serious car accident. She ended up breaking both her legs and was in a wheelchair for about four months as they healed and she learned to walk again. About two months into her recovery, she was well enough to go out for short amounts of time.\n\nSo, one day, we decided to head out to a local store just to get out of the house. We took my mom's car since it was the easiest car fo her to get in and out of herself, probably a much nicer car than two twentysomethings should have been driving. We get to the store, I pull into the handicap space. I put my keys and sunglasses away, put the handicap placard in the window and I notice a man coming over to the car. I get out of the car to get my sis' wheelchair for her and before I can even get to it, this man comes over and starts BERATING me for parking in the handicap space, like actually yelling at me saying all the usual stuff \"how dare you use someone else's placard\", \"you are young and healthy, you don't belong here\", \"save the space for those who need it\", etc. I let him prattle on bit and people started to kind of gather. When he finally shut up and was waiting for me to respond, I just hit the button for the trunk of the car, pulled out my sis' WHEELCHAIR, and opened it on the ground with a \"thunk.\" I didn't say a single word.\n\nThis guy must have turned about 10 shades of red in 10 seconds. He turned and got out of there asap, but HE DID NOT APOLOGIZE. What an a-hole.\n\nMy sis and I definitely had a good laugh out of that one. I'd like to say it was our only incident, but it wasn't. People seem to be very, very concerned about where others park, even with a handicap placard clearly displayed in the window.",

A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nEarlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nHe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said \"Okay\", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.\n\nMy group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd.

When he catches up, I usually just point directly at him and say the magic words \"If you'd like to take it up with my reason for being here, please do!\" as he is approaching me asking what's going on.\n\nAnd OH BOY does he ever.  People almost always assume that because I return to the car first, that I'm the one that parked there while using a placard illegitemately, because I'm obviously fully functional.  Sometimes, my SO will lag behind because he remembers something he's forgotten, or for whatever reason, and he can still be in the store for up to a good 20 - 30 minutes after I've already come out.  I'm not in the habit of telling my SO what he can and can't do when we go to any store.  If he needs to go to one he can't get to, I'm pretty much his only mode of transportation whether I want to shop with him or not.\n\nOne person even told me that we should always stick together to avoid situations like this, and I just told her that people like her should just mind their own F'ing business.  He's got as much right to have that spot as the next handicap person does and they are first come first server spots for the handicap, not the loudest naggers.  So, if she wanted to save herself some embarrassment, she should have minded her own f'ing business.  \n\nPeople, now-a-days, are no longer responding to politeness, and they're starting out on the attack.  Well, if they're going to do that, I say, go in for the kill.  Because kindness doesn't do these people any good.  Maybe embarrassing the hell out of them will teach them to stay in their lane.",

People still feel the need to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you\u201d and it makes me feel like an invalid. </p>\n\n<p>My mother on the other hand has a brain tumour. It\u2019s started to really affect her, and although she does look miles younger than her nearly 60 years of age, she gets so upset when people say \u201coh you don\u2019t look sick, you\u2019re too young to be sick\u201d \nLike no one can see inside her head, she can hear her own blood pumping constantly because the tumour is pressing on a vein and it drives her a little mad. She\u2019s exhausted all the time, she\u2019s having personality changes she hates, and there\u2019s assholes out there making her feel like she\u2019s faking. It\u2019s a fucking tumour! \nWe both get harassment and it\u2019s inexcusable. </p>\n\n<p>Im sorry for your mom and her illness too, it\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s in pain, and tired and sick of it, but to have people question you on it is not okay. It just makes it worse.</p>\n</div>",
