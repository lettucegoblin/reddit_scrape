        "body": "Hi, OP - you sound very reasonable, and it's great that you were willing to change your mind after your wife and stepdaughter showed they were in the right :) You and your family sound great!\n\nOne thing I would add here is that you might want to consider apologising not just for being wrong about the period thing (which I see you've already done), but also for using \"it's my house and what I say goes\" to try to end the argument. Your wife and stepdaughter probably won't resent you too much in the long run for being wrong about one issue, especially since you apologised afterward. What *can* cause long-term resentment is if you have a habit of treating everyday disputes as power/control issues, and acting like you should always have the final say over everything because it's your house.\n\nThis can be an issue in a lot of families (in general, owning a house doesn't mean the other people in that house lose their normal spheres of autonomy, and acting like it does can be controlling), but particularly in your case, it might be one to watch out for because your wife and stepdaughter sold their house in order to move in with you and combine your families. All of you live there now - I'm sure you don't mean to suggest that your wife and stepdaughter should permanently have less autonomy than you and your sons in your *shared family home* just because you legally own the property. That would be a really uncomfortable and unequal situation to create in your family, and runs the risk of creating a rift and sowing the seeds of resentment over issues like potential favouritism (especially because they left their familiar environment for you). Even if this isn't what you meant to convey, it's how it comes across if you pull the \"it's my house\" card regularly.\n\nI thought I would mention this as it seems to be an issue in a bunch of your comments - for instance, you said a lot that you didn't personally mind her and your wife disposing of their period products this way, but it was about your sons' discomfort instead. It's great that you didn't personally have an issue even before the PowerPoint lecture - but on the other hand, this means you insisted that she should have to change what she was doing for your sons' sake, *even though* you admitted that what she was doing wasn't actually bad. It's understandable that your sons would need to get used to having a new stepsister, but it's not great to default to her being the one who always has to make compromises just because she's new, regardless of whether these compromises are actually reasonable or whether she's actually doing anything wrong. Again, even if you don't mean it that way, this is the kind of subtly unequal treatment that can cause divisions in the long run.\n\n(One more thing I would mention here is your reply to another commenter where you said she's 19 and not a grown woman. Even if she's not fully mature, she's a legal adult - and honestly, it doesn't matter whether she's a legal adult or not, because even teenagers who are still under 18 should have basic autonomy over things like their bodies and their periods. I would fully expect the average 15yo girl to know more about how to handle her period than the average adult man, because the girl actually has to deal with periods and the man doesn't. And the man in that scenario still shouldn't get to override the girl about period issues just because she's a minor, unless she's really doing something egregiously bad. Even kids should have their own spheres of autonomy, even if these spheres are smaller than adults' \\[which shouldn't apply to your stepdaughter, as she *is* a legal adult\\]. Pulling the \"you're not an adult\" card to try to deny kids a say in things they *should* have a say in is another thing that can cause resentment - it goes back to the same pattern I mentioned earlier about turning everyday disputes into issues of power and control)\n\nThis became a really long comment. I'm not saying you intend to be controlling, to practise favouritism, or to do any of these other things - you sound like you really care for and appreciate your stepdaughter, and it would be a pity if issues like this got in the way. I wish you and your family all the best! :)",
