        "body": "Absolutely NTA.\n\nAs an actual CPS worker, this infuriates me. There are real families out there who are in need of assistance and your sister is wasting our time. \n\nFrom your post and comments, it sounds an awful lot like your sister is trying to take over as your daughter\u2019s new mother. Calling your daughter by a new name was the biggest red flag, at least until your sister attempted to weaponize CPS against you in order to gain custody of your daughter. Make no mistake, that was her goal here: by filing a report that your daughter was being neglected, your sister wanted CPS to take custody of your child and place her with the responsible aunt who filed to ensure her safety. An eight-year-old is not being neglected because they were taught how to clean their room or make a sandwich. Those are absolutely appropriate tasks for a child her age and will teach her responsibility, independence, and good hygiene. \n\nI hope by reading through the other comments, you have come to the conclusion I am about to state: your sister is a threat to your daughter\u2019s safety. She should not have contact with your daughter at all, and you may want to look in to legal protection if you feel it is necessary. Your parents should not be alone with your daughter either. If you decide to allow them contact with their granddaughter, it should be supervised by you and/or someone you trust completely. Your parents are way too nonchalant about the fact that their daughter tried to steal their granddaughter from her own father. I would consider reviewing your own will and any custody plans for your daughter. God forbid anything happen to you, I don\u2019t think your sister or parents are an appropriate placement for your daughter.\n\nAs far as the permanent record issue goes, while I can only speak for CPS in the United States in general and my particular state specifically, a report like this doesn\u2019t really create a record for you or your daughter. Every report is recorded and filed in the internal CPS system by law. In my state, your incident would look like this:\n\n>(date report was filed)\u2014report type: 51A response 100000###\u2014Allegation: neglect\u2014decision: screened out\n\nThe assigned number will be a link to the transcript of the phone call made by your sister, as well as the log of the visit to your home and the conversations with you and your daughter. Yes your names and birth dates will be in there. But all of that can only be seen by CPS workers in your region (I can only access the CPS server for my state, and I could be fired for looking up people not involved in my assigned cases). We know that false reports are filed, so we have systems in place to ensure that you can\u2019t ruin someone\u2019s life by making a false allegation against them. So yes, there is now a permanent record of this event and it could be found by searching for you. However, it\u2019s not something a private employer could find. The only time I could think of it showing up would be if you applied to work at a school/daycare, in which case CPS would tell the school that you had one report filed against you on this date, and the report was screened out (aka we didn\u2019t even need to open a typical 30-day investigation to figure out it was BS).\n\nI hope you find my comment helpful, and I\u2019ll be glad to answer any follow-up questions you may have. My condolences to you and your daughter. You sound like a wonderful father and your daughter is very lucky to have such a committed parent to help her through what must be a painful and confusing time.",

We know that false reports are filed, so we have systems in place to ensure that you can\u2019t ruin someone\u2019s life by making a false allegation against them. So yes, there is now a permanent record of this event and it could be found by searching for you. However, it\u2019s not something a private employer could find. The only time I could think of it showing up would be if you applied to work at a school/daycare, in which case CPS would tell the school that you had one report filed against you on this date, and the report was screened out (aka we didn\u2019t even need to open a typical 30-day investigation to figure out it was BS).</p>\n\n<p>I hope you find my comment helpful, and I\u2019ll be glad to answer any follow-up questions you may have. My condolences to you and your daughter. You sound like a wonderful father and your daughter is very lucky to have such a committed parent to help her through what must be a painful and confusing time.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "NTA NTA NTA and I went through something very similar this past February. I cut contact with my family as well. \n\nYup, homeschooling mom, newly single (their dad is a former hockey player and hothead who claims to have CTE some sort of brain injury issue, his behavior was so bad I ended up having to kick him out of the house so we could have some peace and quiet and no violence of turmoil), and I told my grandma about some abuse that I endured at the hands of my father when I was a child. Also my parents were trying to tell me how to homeschool, kept sending workbooks in the mail that I never asked for, and were basically telling me I had to use the ones they sent me). \n\nI had lost about 15 lbs in the past 6 months previous to this, and posted a new picture on my Facebook. I was 130lbs and dropped down to 115, a am a bit over 5 foot so I was height weight proportionate. Well they ended up calling Protective services in my state, who got CPS involved, and apparently my ex was conspiring with my family of origin to call protective services, they told the state agency that I had a psychotic break, and I have lost all this weight, and that my place was a mess which was a complete lie. Actually, it's funny because my parents live in a hoarded house themselves with about a dozen dogs. And if my sister didn't have her husband around her house would look the same. Also, my parents told my ex that maybe my kids would be better off with them (my parents) after I kicked him out. They have always tried to paint me as crazy. Most of my life. Saying I had bipolar this and issues that and putting me in Big Pharma med studies at 17 years old. Never looking at their own abusive and neglectful behavior, just trying to project their crazy onto me. And I believed it when I was younger. Eventually I had a councilor call out how controlling and discouraging they were, then I had 3 more doctors afterwards tell me I wasn't any sort of bipolar.\n\n CPS interviewed myself, my kids, and then noticed a picture of myself on the fridge that was a few years old where I was about the same 115 lbs. The CPS agent said, \"wait, you look the same weight in this picture.. what's all this about loosing so much weight?\" And I told her about how I deeply suspect the call to be a revenge call, after letting some family secrets slip out. Also, how my own FATHER once bailed my ex out from jail for DV after he gave me a BLACK EYE. Some father huh? For some reason my parents have encouraged me to stay with him, they are truly sick people, my father has always tried to control me and make me feel less than and put me down, same as my mom. I guess they wanted me around someone else who would do the same? \n\nI would honestly look into family dysfunctional models/and or stories and see if you relate to any of it. Your sister learned it from somewhere... \n\nSo anyway, I have basically disowned all of them, and thank God I live 1700 miles away from them. Best decision of my life. \n\nIt's totally natural to cut contact with people who do this, even family. You're protecting yourself and your daughter from any future harm your sister might bring. Doesn't matter if someone is blood related, if they cross a line and prove themselves to be untrustworthy, sometimes you have to do what's best for you and yours and cut them out.",

The CPS agent said, &quot;wait, you look the same weight in this picture.. what&#39;s all this about loosing so much weight?&quot; And I told her about how I deeply suspect the call to be a revenge call, after letting some family secrets slip out. Also, how my own FATHER once bailed my ex out from jail for DV after he gave me a BLACK EYE. Some father huh? For some reason my parents have encouraged me to stay with him, they are truly sick people, my father has always tried to control me and make me feel less than and put me down, same as my mom. I guess they wanted me around someone else who would do the same? </p>\n\n<p>I would honestly look into family dysfunctional models/and or stories and see if you relate to any of it. Your sister learned it from somewhere... </p>\n\n<p>So anyway, I have basically disowned all of them, and thank God I live 1700 miles away from them. Best decision of my life. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s totally natural to cut contact with people who do this, even family. You&#39;re protecting yourself and your daughter from any future harm your sister might bring. Doesn&#39;t matter if someone is blood related, if they cross a line and prove themselves to be untrustworthy, sometimes you have to do what&#39;s best for you and yours and cut them out.</p>\n</div>",

But my husband is away from home for weeks at a time and my sister called CPS on me because I had some repairs I needed to make in my house. It was a recurring problem that I had fixed in the past but was trying to save up to fix the right way this time so it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I had already put a few thousand dollars into home repairs only a couple months before so i had drained my savings and it took me 2 weeks to save up enough to fix it. That was not fast enough for my sister so she called CPS on me. As soon as they showed up I knew it was her who had called. But she denied it at first but eventually admitted that it was her. She had just finished building a guest room in her house only weeks before that had two beds in it and a closet full of toys. In the two weeks before CPS showed up she started acting really strange. She offered to watch both of my kids at the same time. She normally would only take one at a time. When I said she couldn\u2019t take them right then because one had a doctors appointment she threw a fit. She wanted to make sure that the kids were already at her house when CPS showed up so she would get custody. She let people at her church think that they were her kids. She had them calling her Mommy. She didn\u2019t approve of me letting my kids pick out their own clothes and dress themselves or make themselves a PB&J or a bowl of cereal. She told CPS that I regularly leave my kids home alone.(I don\u2019t)there was more stuff too. I didn\u2019t loose custody but CPS said that the kids could not be in the house until the repairs were completed. I ended up staying with my kids at my in-laws house. It took me about a month to complete the repairs because I could only go to the house to work on repairs when one of my in-laws was not working so they could babysit for me. I wanted to get a baby sitter so I could get it done more quickly but my in-laws insisted that I was not allowed. They didn\u2019t want CPS to think that they were not able to care for my kids and give them problems. I wanted to go NC but my husband convinced me to try to work it out. So a couple months later we tried to set up a dinner with my sister. It didn\u2019t go well. She said we were unfit parents because we didn\u2019t put coats on our kids while my kids were wearing coats. We also invited her to have a supervised visit with my kids counsellor. That didn\u2019t go well either. I could keep going on but for brevity\u2019s sake as this is already to long... we decided to go to my in-laws house for Christmas this year. We had never gone to my in-laws for Christmas before. My whole family through a fit.",

She had just finished building a guest room in her house only weeks before that had two beds in it and a closet full of toys. In the two weeks before CPS showed up she started acting really strange. She offered to watch both of my kids at the same time. She normally would only take one at a time. When I said she couldn\u2019t take them right then because one had a doctors appointment she threw a fit. She wanted to make sure that the kids were already at her house when CPS showed up so she would get custody. She let people at her church think that they were her kids. She had them calling her Mommy. She didn\u2019t approve of me letting my kids pick out their own clothes and dress themselves or make themselves a PB&amp;J or a bowl of cereal. She told CPS that I regularly leave my kids home alone.(I don\u2019t)there was more stuff too. I didn\u2019t loose custody but CPS said that the kids could not be in the house until the repairs were completed. I ended up staying with my kids at my in-laws house. It took me about a month to complete the repairs because I could only go to the house to work on repairs when one of my in-laws was not working so they could babysit for me. I wanted to get a baby sitter so I could get it done more quickly but my in-laws insisted that I was not allowed. They didn\u2019t want CPS to think that they were not able to care for my kids and give them problems. I wanted to go NC but my husband convinced me to try to work it out. So a couple months later we tried to set up a dinner with my sister. It didn\u2019t go well. She said we were unfit parents because we didn\u2019t put coats on our kids while my kids were wearing coats. We also invited her to have a supervised visit with my kids counsellor. That didn\u2019t go well either. I could keep going on but for brevity\u2019s sake as this is already to long... we decided to go to my in-laws house for Christmas this year. We had never gone to my in-laws for Christmas before. My whole family through a fit.</p>\n</div>",

NTA.\n\nThis woman has overstepped her boundaries, and made decisions that should dedicated to the PARENTS of the child (Redecorating their room, having a say in what they learn, CALLING HER A DIFFERENT NAME).\n\nGiven your sisters struggles with conceiving, and I'm assuming lack of children of her own, at an age where pregnancy is downright impossible without medical assistance for anyone who's struggled with fertility in the past I believe there is a chance she is trying to kidnap your child in a legal manor.\n\nIt is not a rare occurrence where members of family try to use CPS and false abuse claims to rip children from parents and gain custody. Note, that is not to say that reporting CPS on a family member when there genuinly is signs of abuse is not the best thing to do, but this isn't the case based on pretty much everything you've said. \n\nCalling CPS not only endangered you and your child, it was a malicious and downright evil to take a source that is meant to be used to save children from genuine abuse and neglect as a backhanded response to an argument that was ridiculous and one-sided to begin with. Teaching your child to take care of herself is Parenting 101 and your ex-sister is delusional if she thinks that there is anything wrong with that. \n\nYour family does not get a say in what constitutes as unforgivable to you. What your sister did IS unforgivable. Not only did she do something insulting and dangerous to you and your daughter, she did it in wake of you and your daughter going through a terrible tragedy that already changed your way of life. \n\nDo not go back in contact with that woman, she is dangerous to you and your daughter, and is a high risk of falsifying abuse claims that can risk the custody of your daughter. \n\nIf this is the first Christmas that you and your daughter are having between just the two of you, then its important that she feels safe and comfortable and you feel the same way too. Holidays in the midst of losing a loved one are difficult times for people who are mourning, and the lack of any extra stress or worry is completely recommended for you and your daughter to be able to find joy this season. Your wife is with you in spirit and I'm positive she would be incredibly proud and happy with how you and your daughter are showing so much strength and the lengths you're going through to guarantee your daughter has a safe and loving life. You're doing amazing, and you are doing what is best for your daughter. Never doubt that.",

NTA.</p>\n\n<p>This woman has overstepped her boundaries, and made decisions that should dedicated to the PARENTS of the child (Redecorating their room, having a say in what they learn, CALLING HER A DIFFERENT NAME).</p>\n\n<p>Given your sisters struggles with conceiving, and I&#39;m assuming lack of children of her own, at an age where pregnancy is downright impossible without medical assistance for anyone who&#39;s struggled with fertility in the past I believe there is a chance she is trying to kidnap your child in a legal manor.</p>\n\n<p>It is not a rare occurrence where members of family try to use CPS and false abuse claims to rip children from parents and gain custody. Note, that is not to say that reporting CPS on a family member when there genuinly is signs of abuse is not the best thing to do, but this isn&#39;t the case based on pretty much everything you&#39;ve said. </p>\n\n<p>Calling CPS not only endangered you and your child, it was a malicious and downright evil to take a source that is meant to be used to save children from genuine abuse and neglect as a backhanded response to an argument that was ridiculous and one-sided to begin with. Teaching your child to take care of herself is Parenting 101 and your ex-sister is delusional if she thinks that there is anything wrong with that. </p>\n\n<p>Your family does not get a say in what constitutes as unforgivable to you. What your sister did IS unforgivable. Not only did she do something insulting and dangerous to you and your daughter, she did it in wake of you and your daughter going through a terrible tragedy that already changed your way of life. </p>\n\n<p>Do not go back in contact with that woman, she is dangerous to you and your daughter, and is a high risk of falsifying abuse claims that can risk the custody of your daughter. </p>\n\n<p>If this is the first Christmas that you and your daughter are having between just the two of you, then its important that she feels safe and comfortable and you feel the same way too. Holidays in the midst of losing a loved one are difficult times for people who are mourning, and the lack of any extra stress or worry is completely recommended for you and your daughter to be able to find joy this season. Your wife is with you in spirit and I&#39;m positive she would be incredibly proud and happy with how you and your daughter are showing so much strength and the lengths you&#39;re going through to guarantee your daughter has a safe and loving life. You&#39;re doing amazing, and you are doing what is best for your daughter. Never doubt that.</p>\n</div>",

Too many girls are raised with fathers who do everything for them, and the end result is you get a woman who is dependent on a man for everything. You're sister has issues, and I'd walk as far away as you can. \n\nIf you don't want to cut your younger sister out like that, set ground rules with her. Tell here that what's happening between you and the other sister have zero bearing on your relationship with her, provided she doesn't let it. If she wants to talk to you, tell her she can call. But the moment the sister comes up, tell her that you're only interested in what's going on in her life. I have had to do this multiple times in my life. I have twin sisters who are younger than me....it can work. \n\nAlso, you'd be helping your younger sister see that she isn't tied to her bigger sister like that. \n\nHowever you handle all of that....I'm sorry you've got all this on your plate. Do the best you can for you and your daughter. Let her know that you love her, that she is always safe with you, and can talk to you about anything. Give her those things as well as stability and she will turn out just fine.",

As someone who has worked with CPS in the past, that's a bullshit reason to call in a child abuse report. Teaching kids life skills is part of being a parent. Your sister wasted a lot of CPS's valuable time that could have gone towards addressing actual issues within your community. Unless she's ready to verbalize that, along with a genuine apology for the upheaval she's put you through during an already difficult time, going no contact sounds like the best option from my perspective. \n\nJust a stray thought - has your sister struggled with infertility in the past? Does she have kids of her own? Between suddenly calling your daughter by a new name, calling CPS, and how much she's insisting your daughter stay at her house with her, my gut instinct is that she's trying to steal your daughter. I fear she called CPS hoping your daughter would be taken from you so she could step up and be the surrogate parent. I've seen it happen before, many times. I don't know for sure that this is happening. You know your situation better than I do. I just have a feeling. Keep an eye out.\n\nPractical advice: seek out grief counseling for both yourself and your daughter. You are doing the absolute best you can as her father, but there are some things that  require the expertise of a trained third party. Dealing with grief is frequently one of them, especially when you compound it with fresh family drama and losing a large part of your support system due to your sister's actions. (And rest of the family as well, frankly; your family should be ashamed of your sister's actions and reprimand her rather than trying to smooth things over and brush past it.)\n\nI wish you the best on your healing journey. Stay strong and seek out healthy support systems (therapy/counseling, community resources, your in-laws, etc) as much as you can, for both yourself and your daughter.",

Your sister is  clearly mental and could abscond with her over the smallest perceived danger. \n\nMy husband and I went through a similar situation. I was very ill with fibromyalgia and on pain meds. We decided together that I would go off of them since the side effects weren\u2019t worth the little they actually helped. Took me 6 months to taper off. By that time my BIL (sister\u2019s husband), who was in nursing school, had convinced my sister and my mom that fibro doesn\u2019t hurt that much and I was just an addict. Long story short, CPS was called. We proved I wasn\u2019t an addict in less than 6 hours, the case went to a judge for an emergency hearing and it was dismissed. Let me put it this way, when we went to CPS to be interviewed, it was easy to prove it was bullshit. By the end of the interview, the children\u2019s attorney ad litem, had invited my husband to go hunting with him. The case was that stupid. The CPS jackass had pushed our oldest so much she started making shit up to please him. Outrageous stuff from a 9 year old. Ludicrous, even. My dad was completely against this and he\u2019s the only reason we stayed in touch with my parents. He\u2019s really that amazing. It did a big number on all of our psyches, especially our 2 girls. There\u2019s a lot more story to it, but it would take forever. We were such \u201cbad parents\u201d that our oldest graduated with her masters from Harvard last year and now works there. Our youngest recently married an amazing man with a 2 year old son (We are grandparents!!!) and just discovered she\u2019s pregnant with their first together. She\u2019s an amazing mom. \n\nIronically, or just bad karma, my sister was diagnosed with fibromyalgia many years later and, guess what?!  It really hurts that bad. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you both had to go through that!  It\u2019s so traumatic!  We were told, that because the findings were for us, it wouldn\u2019t be on our record.

My mom tells the most deranged lies, and they eat them up. If OP allows his family to be alone with his kid I can promise you the sister will have access. I promise they share information about her and pictures. They are a danger, too.</p>\n</div>",
