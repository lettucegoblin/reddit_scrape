I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter\u2019s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. \n\nA couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. \n\nSo after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. \n\nI sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. \n\nI encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.\n\nShe got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.\n\nSo class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is *Keeley\u2019s* Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d \n\nA few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. \n\nThe long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. </p>\n\n<p>So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. </p>\n\n<p>I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. </p>\n\n<p>I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.</p>\n\n<p>She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.</p>\n\n<p>So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is <em>Keeley\u2019s</em> Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>A few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. </p>\n\n<p>The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

Some of them with get a Jane Doe calling in and make Jane Doe spell for name. Because they can&#39;t use their brain and try the common spelling. <strong>Even worse is that we can look people up by phone numbers but they refuse to do it that way.</strong>        </p>\n\n<p>My other comments explaining it better:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh it&#39;s more than that. They don&#39;t even try. So Sam Smyth calls in and immediately they&#39;re confused why they can&#39;t find him. While I&#39;m typing &quot;Sm , Sam&quot; into the database and adding a birthday usually pulls them up in our system. Sometimes I&#39;ve had to stop, apologize, let then know I can&#39;t find them and use a phonetic alphabet to double check.       </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Again I usually use a phone number so spelling isn&#39;t usually an issue.</strong>         </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But say Saem Smythe calls in and pronounces his name Sam Smith. I won&#39;t immediately type it in and assume. If I&#39;m creating a chart, I&#39;m going to be an anal retentive picky bitch. So much that even though he says &quot;Sam Smith&quot;, I still ramble it off like an auctioneer or rapper. That way they have time to tell me &quot;oh hahah no it&#39;s spelled a little different&quot; or the likes.             </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a scenario.     </p>\n\n<p>You call in and get my coworker Andrea. Your name is something like Gavrie Chernyshevsky.     </p>\n\n<p>I already have you pulled up by phone number. So after you spell out your first and last name we proceed.      </p>\n\n<p>Andrea now. Is going to mishear each and every letter you spell out. She refuses to use a phonetic alphabet. You spell the first name GARVRIE. She hears EIRERAI. You tell her it starts with G like giraffe. So now she has GIRERAI. You&#39;re going back forth for a good several minutes over each and every single letter of your first name. Then once that&#39;s done. Andrea starts the fun of mishearing your last name and you get stuck with her for 10-30 minutes. When the call should have been 2-5 minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

So when I came in, I went to my desk, and they'd put the guy's business card on my desk, his last name was Janacek.    There's a famous composer with that name, and my dad came from a very musical family, so of course I didn't think twice when I said \"Hello Mr. Janacek\" pronouncing it Yah-na-check without thinking.  The meeting ground to a halt as he turned,puzzled and said to me, \"Do you have Czech heritage?\"  And I couldn't figure out why on earth he would ask me that question out of the blue.   Turns out everyone pronounced his name Jane-sek, and he'd just given up and accepted it, until I outed myself as an immigrant's daughter haha!",

I was dumbfounded &amp; said well yeah I had my shifts changed &amp; I work Sundays now &amp; why would I brazenly come in to my actual work place to shop if I was skiving. I told her which manager I had sorted it all with too.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of looking up any paperwork about the shift change, looking up that I had been working all those Sundays, or asking the other manager to clear it up officially, she did nothing about it &amp; slowly &amp; reluctantly believed me on my word only &amp; said \u201cYeah I guess why would you come in if you were supposed to be working\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I left completely baffled &amp; wondered if I was even still employed &amp; if anyone knew I was coming in &amp; working Sundays if I\u2019m apparently noted as not turning up to work on my allocated day.</p>\n</div>",
