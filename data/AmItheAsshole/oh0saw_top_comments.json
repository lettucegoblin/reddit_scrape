I tried to get my husband to like cooked carrots so once I made them with a nice sweet ginger sauce and he tried to eat them but I saw him gagging and I said no more carrots. I think your mum was very anxious to be a good hostess. It is possible that she has autistic tendencies herself that make it hard for her to communicate or consider alternatives when she is really stressed out. A lot of parents of autistics are also autistic themselves. I am glad you managed to work it out and I bet the ducks are even happier.</p>\n</div>",

But I know I will always be loved somewhere by someone because my mum has shown me that I\u2019m good as I am and that she loves me anyways. I think as long as you\u2019re kind to your child and love them it will be easier to deal with mean people too. I\u2019m glad you are consciously thinking of him. You sound like a nice person and a good mum. I wish you all the best. And your son too.",
