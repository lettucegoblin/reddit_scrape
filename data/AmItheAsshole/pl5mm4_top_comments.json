        "body": "Things I lost over the 16 years I was with my \"Nate\":\n\n* My love for singing.  I was always told I was a bad singer, but it was with him that I learned my voice is awful to the point that even I hated to hear it.  I didn't sing for almost 16 years except when alone and wearing headphones, because I couldn't bear it.  \n* My independence and approach to DIY.  He didn't want to have to do anything to improve the house, and would get annoyed whenever I tried to do anything, so I stopped talking about painting rooms or making them look nicer, and even stopped repairing broken things in the house.  Many of which broke because he damaged them during an outburst.\n* My enjoyment of scented candles and incense.  He would always get annoyed and would hate the smell of any I chose, so I didn't use them.\n* My exploration of my weird music tastes.  He would listen to his music really loud all day, but if I asked for a turn at playing something I liked, I'd get maybe 1.5 songs into it before he'd want to change it.  For years the only music of mine I listened to was the stuff I already knew before meeting him - I had no reason to explore new music anyway.\n* My love of dancing.  I loved going to places that played my kind of music and dancing wildly to them.  But he never wanted to go out with me, and if I went out alone or with friends he'd be calling me after a couple of hours wanting to know when I'd be home, so I just stopped doing it.  I stopped dancing at home, because he'd complain that I was making too much noise or shaking the house.\n\nThen I left him.  18-34 years old spent with him and I had to re-learn how to be Me again, but I did.\n\n* When I first started singing again, alone, after I left him, I had to do it with headphones.  My voice would crack and crackle from the strain because it was so unused to it.  When my current nesting partner heard me sing the first time, over a year together, by accident when I was washing dishes and didn't know he was home, I was so scared he'd hate it but he was just overjoyed to hear me.  Even now, when we're hanging out and I feel brave enough to sing, he'll rest his head on my chest to listen, because I still can't do it very loudly.\n* After we broke up, it took me 6 months to realise I could decorate if I wanted.  It took a year before I felt ready to try repairing the things he'd broken.  But after I did it once, I did it again and again.  Now my bedroom is dark blue with copper accents, my craft room is a cheery lilac grey and there's a mural slowly being painted in an alcove.\n* I treated myself to scented candles almost immediately after he moved out, and I'll light them whenever I feel like it.  I have so many now, and my home always smells inviting.\n* In the past 3 years I have discovered literally dozens of bands I never knew about, and have gained a reputation among new friends for having an eclectic taste.  My new friends will often suggest unusual bands to me to see if I'll like them.\n* My nesting partner loves music, and loves to dance, and if I am in the house dancing to something he always gets up and joins me, because he loves to see me happy.  And when I go to watch his band play, I dance all night long.\n\nI promise you, as the weeks go by, you'll be amazed how many parts of yourself you never even realised you were putting to sleep have woken up and started blossoming again.  I am so glad you've made the move you have, and I hope you get to enjoy your own baking, and trying new recipes, and feeling beautiful in lingerie, and dancing in whatever fun, silly ways you fancy, every day.",

He would always get annoyed and would hate the smell of any I chose, so I didn&#39;t use them.</li>\n<li>My exploration of my weird music tastes.  He would listen to his music really loud all day, but if I asked for a turn at playing something I liked, I&#39;d get maybe 1.5 songs into it before he&#39;d want to change it.  For years the only music of mine I listened to was the stuff I already knew before meeting him - I had no reason to explore new music anyway.</li>\n<li>My love of dancing.  I loved going to places that played my kind of music and dancing wildly to them.  But he never wanted to go out with me, and if I went out alone or with friends he&#39;d be calling me after a couple of hours wanting to know when I&#39;d be home, so I just stopped doing it.  I stopped dancing at home, because he&#39;d complain that I was making too much noise or shaking the house.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then I left him.  18-34 years old spent with him and I had to re-learn how to be Me again, but I did.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When I first started singing again, alone, after I left him, I had to do it with headphones.  My voice would crack and crackle from the strain because it was so unused to it.  When my current nesting partner heard me sing the first time, over a year together, by accident when I was washing dishes and didn&#39;t know he was home, I was so scared he&#39;d hate it but he was just overjoyed to hear me.  Even now, when we&#39;re hanging out and I feel brave enough to sing, he&#39;ll rest his head on my chest to listen, because I still can&#39;t do it very loudly.</li>\n<li>After we broke up, it took me 6 months to realise I could decorate if I wanted.  It took a year before I felt ready to try repairing the things he&#39;d broken.  But after I did it once, I did it again and again.  Now my bedroom is dark blue with copper accents, my craft room is a cheery lilac grey and there&#39;s a mural slowly being painted in an alcove.</li>\n<li>I treated myself to scented candles almost immediately after he moved out, and I&#39;ll light them whenever I feel like it.  I have so many now, and my home always smells inviting.</li>\n<li>In the past 3 years I have discovered literally dozens of bands I never knew about, and have gained a reputation among new friends for having an eclectic taste.  My new friends will often suggest unusual bands to me to see if I&#39;ll like them.</li>\n<li>My nesting partner loves music, and loves to dance, and if I am in the house dancing to something he always gets up and joins me, because he loves to see me happy.  And when I go to watch his band play, I dance all night long.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I promise you, as the weeks go by, you&#39;ll be amazed how many parts of yourself you never even realised you were putting to sleep have woken up and started blossoming again.  I am so glad you&#39;ve made the move you have, and I hope you get to enjoy your own baking, and trying new recipes, and feeling beautiful in lingerie, and dancing in whatever fun, silly ways you fancy, every day.</p>\n</div>",

This update is the best one I've read in a while.\n\nLook, maybe this is the \"come to jesus\" moment he needs to really embrace healthy change for himself, maybe not. You're doing absolutely the right thing by getting distance and saying \"we will see, later\" to his promises.\n\nIt takes a person on average a minimum of 6 months for change to become habit - habits tend to stick more than \"change\" does. Change usually lasts for as long as it takes to get the other person to think it's real (2 - 6 weeks) and then things slide back to how they were before.\n\nSo, great, maybe he will change. But don't allow yourself to be the reason or guinea pig for that change. He can do it on his own - like really on his own away from you. Go no contact for at least 6 months so he can deal with himself fully without you being involved. You need that space too, to reconnect with your beautiful joyous self and remember who you were, and discover who you are now all without any guilt tripping or obligations to support him. Go your own way.\n\nIn 6 months or so check in with yourself. If you feel like you truly want to, you can then check in with him and maybe, maybe if you like the change you see and he asks, maybe you can start being friends with him again... and maybe in another month or so, start dating him again. But this time extend that dating period and really observe who he is long term. Don't rush to move back in, make sure that the space truly exists for you to be joyous and free around him without being judged or wronged or feeling like you have to walk on eggshells and be approved of by him.\n\nGo from there. Second chances don't mean \"And now we pretend the bad thing never happened and just go back to how things were!\" - it means real re-evaluation and commitments and long term habit shifting to healthier, happier things that are sustained.\n\nIf you don't hold out for all that, things just go back to how they were and you're unhappy again and this time you feel even more obligated to stick with it because \"he's trying\" or \"I promised\". \n\nWishing you all the best.

Which left me free to do things like vacuuming while playing and singing along to music because why not?!?!</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a hard time, and there may be times when you\u2019re tempted by the good times in the past, but be strong. If he\u2019s changed, it won\u2019t just be words - it\u2019ll be actions, and you can make the determination of whether you want anything to do with him in the future from a place where you feel safe to be yourself.</p>\n</div>",
