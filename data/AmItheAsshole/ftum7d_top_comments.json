Could you maybe have paid him a little more? Yeah. Did you take advantage of him? You did, but someone always has to be the bigger fool when buying and selling. At the end of the day it is the responsibility of both parties to research and determine the value of what is being sold, he just didn\u2019t do his job</p>\n\n<p>(Also, for the people quoting contract law, a quick google search shows that since the guy selling proposed the price that was eventually agreed to, malicious misinformation doesn\u2019t apply.

Honestly, if the guitar was so important the guy wouldn\u2019t even be selling it in the first place. It\u2019s not on OP to set the sell price of the item he\u2019s buying, that\u2019s one hundred percent on the seller. It was the sellers fault through and through and OP never once did anything underhanded. If the seller asked him to price it before selling it, and op undercut him, then OP would have been the asshole. Also, if the guitar was still in good condition, <em>and</em> with all its original receipts that would have flagged any sane person that it potentially had high value. Not to mention, the guy went and harassed his wife at work. Dude was just crazy about money and couldn\u2019t handle it when he learned he should have researched it first.</p>\n</div>",

We ate lunch together everyday.  When he died I was absolutely devastated.  I don't have many memories for three months after he died. I think my brain just quit recording due to the trauma of his death. It was very unexpected.  My dad had a client that came to me one week after my dad's death demanding he be reimbursed for a service my dad did for him many years ago.  I couldn't deal with the man or his issue.  I just paid him and asked him to leave me alone.  Even now almost twenty years later I'm angry at myself for not being strong enough to stand up to the man. It was obvious that he wasn't happy because he hadn't done properly maintenance and upkeep and that's the reason he was unhappy.  Like buying a new car and never changing there oil. Eventually you will have engine trouble but it isn't the car dealers fault.  That man definitely took advantage of me in my most vulnerable time and gained a good amount of money in the process.  You are correct in saying that is a horrible time to take advantage of someone.  Not illegal but nonetheless horrible and reprehensible.",

Pickers is slightly staged in that they do receive tips on things before going out to film there. They don\u2019t waste time sniffing around for a good deal they hear about it in advanced. But it represents a very real thing and an entire industry that exists solely off this exact practice. You can pretty much call it the vintage and antiques business. My parents are vintage/antique dealers and I grew up on this sort of thing. \n\nEverywhere all the time things are sold below their value and purchased by people knowing the value is higher. And a small chunk of people make a whole living off of it. This is why it\u2019s ideal to hire people to liquidate estates, or estate sale companies.
