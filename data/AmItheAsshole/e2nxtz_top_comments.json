We can&#39;t look into their hearts. What we <em>do</em> know is that you blocked your father from seeing her for yourself, not for her. For some type of petty revenge. Life is short, and the fact that your dad is a cheater doesn&#39;t mean that the love he feels for your mother is gone.</p>\n</div>",

He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. \n\nMy mother was devastated and stopped eating properly. In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. \n\nAll this time, we, her children have looked after her.

Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. \n\nDuring her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth.

When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. \n\nWhen he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. \n\nMy mother passed away the next morning.

OP, you are DEFINITELY not the asshole in this situation. I think that whoever is coming on here and saying you are the asshole has confused two things. Yes, love IS complicated. But actions and their consequences are not. What I mean is, despite everything your dad did to your mom (and to you and your siblings), that doesn't mean he didn't (or doesn't) love your mom. The fact of the matter is that his actions were inappropriate and did not speak to the love that he had for her. He lost the right to have his feelings validated in her last moments of life because of how he behaved. Nonetheless, when your mom was close to death, he probably finally had the realization of how \"final\" his actions were. That is likely why he responded so emotionally. That does not excuse what he did, but his emotions were probably real.\n\nOP, if you decide that you want to sever your ties with your dad and never speak to him or have a relationship with him, I don't think you'd be in the wrong. However, you don't know how you'll feel about this 10-20 years from now. You may eventually decide that you want to have SOME kind of relationship with your dad. You may decide that you want to tell your dad how much he hurt you. You may decide that you'd rather have an imperfect and selfish father in your life  than no parent at all. Or you might not. No one has any way of knowing. People do make terrible, horrible mistakes in life. And they may eventually come to regret them, or at least feel tremendous guilt about them. That being said, the last moments of your mom's life was not the time for your dad to have his guilt or his feelings validated. That wouldn't be fair to you or your mom. He deserves to suffer some consequences for what he did. Does that mean he deserves eternal guilt and emotional anguish? Not necessarily.

But there is a limit to how far you can go in retaliation against others, and you crossed it.\n\nFirstly, your father had no way of knowing when he cheated and then filed for divorce that his wife had a terminal illness and that his actions would expedite that process (if they did). In my view he can't be blamed for your mother's fate even if he can be blamed for being selfish. He didn't sign up for what happened.\n\nSecondly, the illness put your father in a precarious situation given what he did. After causing your mom so much pain, I would imagine he would have wanted to keep his distance from her while she underwent treatment on the grounds that being around him could have caused your mom even more distress and could have made the situation worse. He also wasn't absent from the situation entirely\u2014he offered to foot the bill entire bill for the treatment, which is no small commitment especially if you're American. He was involved in a way that he could be.\n\nThirdly, the man can hardly be blamed for moving cities. Whether his new child was conceived in an affair or not, he does still have a responsibility for his partner and especially for his child, the latter of whom didn't sign up for their life. He isn't entirely a deadbeat here, his responsibility towards many conflicting parties makes his situation ambiguous and nuanced.\n\nFourthly, cheaters are terrible but they are human, and sometimes are empathetic to those whom they cheated on. That may be uncomfortable to acknowledge, but not all cheaters are amoral sociopaths who are perfectly selfish and numb to the suffering of the people they cheated on. If your father's account is true\u2014if he cheated on your mom because he did the wrong thing after falling in love with another woman, and he still cares about your mom\u2014then facing the death of your mom is an extreme source of trauma. It would have been traumatic even if he had gotten to see her, but now that you denied him his final moments, you've driven the knife further in the wound.\n\nLots of people want to take the attitude that if you cheat on someone you're automatically evil scum and you can suffer, but in my view there is a line where you go beyond reasonable anger against a cheater and enter into depraved sadism. Preventing your father from getting closure on someone he loved but wronged before she died crosses that line. I understand why you did it, but you shouldn't have. It was too far.\n\nEdit: Okay that's it I'm done replying to comments, there are too many and I'm just repeating myself at this point.",

If they were dying would you actually be like, &quot;okay cool no problem. I don&#39;t need to try to see them.&quot; It&#39;s unlikely.</p>\n</div>",

No one can tell you how to grieve or cope with your anger or disappointment. And in the same vein, you shouldn\u2019t determine how someone else grieves or deny them the right to grieve when it costs both you and your mother nothing. If she was unconscious allowing him to see her would have caused her no further emotional turmoil. And no matter how hollow it may seem to you for him to be with her for a few moments before she passed, you can\u2019t possibly know the significance it may have for him. Regardless of how you perceive it, if he seems unrepentant or insincere, I doubt he is unaware of the anguish he\u2019s caused unless he just absolutely has no empathy. Based on his state and the condition he was in and what he did to be there, it\u2019s apparent that he did truly care in some way \u2014 that it did mean something. And regardless of if you think he deserves any form of closure, I really don\u2019t think that should\u2019ve been your decision to make. I don\u2019t mean to sound presumptuous but I think in 20 years you\u2019ll probably regret this decision.

And it\u2019s an act that I don\u2019t think we should ever forget or pretend never happened, it\u2019s a stain on who he is as a person. That being said, it\u2019s been 24 years since that happened. He\u2019s a different man. He\u2019s fully aware that what he did was abhorrent. He doesn\u2019t think that he deserves forgiveness. He\u2019s told me a few times over the years, when things are bad for him or I mentally, that he knows part of it stemmed from that night. But my mom\u2019s forgiven him. I\u2019ve forgiven him.

He didn't support her, help her, keep any of those so-called platonic feelings going, make her last days gentle...he ran off to play home with the new vag and new baby. Oh, he managed not to push the divorce? Funny that that could benefit him in the estate, that. Not so magnanimous, really.\n\nDidn't seem like mom wanted to see the f\\*cker while she was declining, and I doubt the kids who aren't cute/good enough now they're grown want the f\\*ckhead around, why must they put up with further Big Dramaz from him?\n\nI see where you're coming from and respect that, but can't agree... he's an asshole because no lessons were learned. He didn't humbly ask for a chance to say goodbye to the mother of his kids/someone he still cares for platonically, he DEMANDED, in a high drama. Same sort of drama that fits the pattern of cheating, new family, new baby. It's exciting...so much more exciting then being loyal and loving to his grown kids and wife who stood by him, and according them gentle respect if he really did 'fall out of love' and split for honest reasons. It's All About Him.\n\nHonestly, if there'd been signs, even too late, of a legit change of heart- of humility, of understanding for other people's feelings- I'd feel more like he wasn't an ass, but as it is... he hopped in his new hotties bed so happily, he can go lie in it.",

I can almost promise you this was the point -- and he&#39;s going to argue that he &quot;tried&quot; to pay for her care but the kids refused to let him.  I hope they find the nastiest, meanest lawyer they can collectively afford to sort this out.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Man I just gotta say, FUCK cheaters, if you can't break up with your partner and instead betray their trust, especially in long term relationships, you have the emotional maturity of a fucking child, and are risking real emotional damage to another human because you couldn't keep it in your pants long enough, or toughen up enough, to just end it and save the betrayal and unneeded pain and suffering, that could very very likely result in tainting their future relationships by peppering in trust issues from being betrayed by the person they likely trusted the most in the world\n\nThis asshole doesn't deserve forgiveness, unless it's for the sake of the entire goddamn family he ripped apart in his selfish pursuits of lust. In my eyes it's not a mistake, and it never is, it's an active choice to go behind the back of the person you claim to love, likely having them remain completely ignorant to your actions, the ***only*** slightly redeeming factor of any cheater, is if they actually have the guts to immediately go back and admit what they've done, but that usually isn't the case\n\nIf you can run off and fuck someone behind your partners back, and then eventually blindsight them either by tanking your relationship, or just packing up your shit and saying your leaving, after God knows how long of coming home from cheating on them and pretending you actually give a shit about them, you have no conscience, you have shit morals, and you are an awful human being\n\nAnd this is exactly what ops dad did to his wife of a fucking quarter century, he went off and fucked another woman behind her back, and probably came back every night, looked her in the eyes and told her he loved her, pretended he was still dedicated and caring while hurting her in a way that might have quite literally killed her.. fuck this guy, and fuck anyone defending him, or people who cheat in general, grow the fuck up and learn to actually speak up about your feelings and desires, and stop senselessly hurting and damaging other fucking humans for your cheap shitty thrills\n\nI obviously can't speak as to if his mother would have wanted to see his father or not, but I would argue after the shit he pulled, the safest bet would be no. There's nothing he could say nor do to fix that ultimate betrayal against her and her family. He was almost certainly coming to ask for forgiveness, but not for her sake, for his own, because he realized the impact and devastation he caused to his entire family in his selfish stupid choices, and he needed to be forgiven to actually sleep at night with the awful fucking thing he did to an entire family\n\nPeople like this asshole make my blood boil, there is never a good reason nor excuse to cheat in a normal relationship, especially if you need to convince the other person you're still happy in order to keep up your betrayal\n\nOp, you got put into an incredibly hard situation, whilst I can see the argument for calling you an asshole, considering the time spent together, you just cannot ignore the fact that he cheated on, then abandoned his wife of ***TWENTY FIVE YEARS*** for another woman, I would argue until the death of me, that when he made the decision to leave and completely devastate his family in the process, he was also making the decision that it was permanent, and likely knowingly decided that he would never be welcome back into that family again, be it within their home, their hospital rooms, or their funerals, he made the choice, to make himself dead to them, and he doesn't get to take that back because the shitiness of his actions finally caught up to his conscience, and it took the death of the person he hurt so bad, to finally man up to the hurt and mental damage he forced on another human, by not simply telling her that he was unhappy to begin with, and rather completely blindsiding her and the entire family so he wouldn't have to face the hard conversations he should have faced to begin with, and could rather walk out the door\n\nIn my mind, the second he walked out that door op, he closed that hospital door, as well as the funeral door. Spewing shitty cliches like \"I'll always Love you as the mother of my children and a friend\" doesn't make up for the awful things he did, and he could have just as easily not fucked his employee, he could have just as easily not abandoned his obviously still Loving wife and family, and he could have just as easily not shut the door to that hospital room\n\nBut hey, hindsight is 20/20 right? Well, maybe you should have been able to see in the moment just how much of a selfish fucking asshole you were being by betraying your wife and family in the first place, and abandoning them for a new fling which you didn't even value enough to end your current relationship before starting, just like you didn't value the fucking woman who gave a quarter of a century to you, and gave up her body as she knew it to give you multiple children, whom you also didn't value enough to not abandon and blindside either, by just being goddamn honest with them and yourself, and ending the relationship before you betrayed them.\n\nHe could have spoken up, he could have tried to get help, or simply decided to let it go and end things, but instead he hid it like a coward, and rushed out to not have to face the hurt feelings and the results of his actions face to face, instead throwing himself into another relationship and probably convincing himself of what a good partner to her he is for leaving his wife.\n\nIt was revenge from your end, but an arguably justifiable one, one of his own making, when he decided to walk out that door\n\n***FIRMLY*** NTA",

        "body": "I've been cheated on sure, I'm sure most people have at least once, but it was a short relationship, so it didn't really hit me that hard. Could have also been the fact we were all focused on getting high at the time and didn't really give a shit about much.\n\n\nWhat I have seen though, is the impact it had on my best friend who attempted to kill himself after being cheated on in a 10 year relationship, he had been clean from heroin for 4 years, and 2 months after all hell broke loose, he went out and got some, and shot up $150 in that trash all in one go trying to end his immense heartbreak once and for all. Luckily he was caught soon enough by another friend who had decided to stop by randomly, otherwise he would have almost certainly died from even a quarter of what he did with zero tolerance, in an area with an extremely rampant fentanyl problem thanks to the spread of Subutex treatment programs, people have learned that (apparently it does anyways, I can't personally confirm this as I've never tried, because I never intend to pick that shit up again, had a hard enough time putting it down the first time after it ruined myself as I knew me and I lost every part of my personality that I actually liked) fentanyl can evidently as I was told it, \"knock the Buprenorphine out of your system\" and allow heroin to start hitting you again, as how Subutex works is by clogging up the receptors that heroin or opiates in general latch on to in order to get you high.\n\nIt has a real mental impact on people, it needlessly causes damage and anguish, most of which could have been avoided with a courteous breakup, he didn't care about the end of the relationship nearly as much as the betrayal it's self. In fact he ended it himself, he hated her, but in his own words \"I just couldn't handle the thought of her fucking another guy while I sat there waiting for her to come home, only to sit there and tell me how she loves me, talk about the wedding, and act like nothing had even happened, it's the broken trust that hurts the most, and I don't know if I can ever trust anyone like that again\"\n\nAll that over a idiotic lustful pursuit, she could have just as easily done after ending the relationship, but instead chose to betray his trust and lie to his face, and he nearly ended his own life over it, if he had his way he would be gone right now\n\nI can't confirm that it was the specific reason behind it, but our other closest friend had a 3.5 year relationship end in the same way, he fell into a major depression and the first day he got into his own apartment after it ended, he either relapsed, or took the same avenue, and ended up becoming braindead in his bathroom that very same first night, and had the plug pulled a few days later. We obviously never got to talk to him about it, but he had hinted at being suicidial before it happened, we did everything we could to try and help him when we had the chance, but it didn't help, and I can't help but feel it's yet another that could have been avoided, if people had quit being massive fucking assholes, and just told the truth and ended it when they wanted to move on\n\nThese two were like brothers to me, we grew up together, we went through the hell that is addiction together, and we got clean together, and I'm almost certain I would be dead right now if I had lost them earlier on. Instead I've watched one attempt to kill himself, and fail, and the other either relapse, or make that same decision, and both of them almost certainly could have been avoided if there people decided not to be greedy lustful assholes, and subject the people they claimed to love to the wave of confidence breaking hell, and emotionally devastating betrayal that comes with finding out that the person you loved was fucking someone else behind your back and playing you as a fool the entire time instead of just ending shit and moving on like a decent/healthy person, who actually gives a shit about the damage they inflict on others with their idiotic greedy decisions\n\nSo yeah, I guess I've been hurt, it's nearly cost me the two people I can count on in life, but instead I got \"lucky\" and only had one die instead. Both of which almost certainly could have been avoided by Being a decent person and not forcing the thoughts of infidelity and inferiority on another who you claim to love.\n\nI've seen the hellish damage it can cause to people's psyche, and hold no forgiveness for the shitty selfish act that is cheating on another person and needlessly causing such vastly higher levels of pain than would have been otherwise experienced by simply ending it with virtually any other excuse, even just saying that you're no longer happy, will have so much less of an impact than running around on them until you inevitably get caught",

Luckily he was caught soon enough by another friend who had decided to stop by randomly, otherwise he would have almost certainly died from even a quarter of what he did with zero tolerance, in an area with an extremely rampant fentanyl problem thanks to the spread of Subutex treatment programs, people have learned that (apparently it does anyways, I can&#39;t personally confirm this as I&#39;ve never tried, because I never intend to pick that shit up again, had a hard enough time putting it down the first time after it ruined myself as I knew me and I lost every part of my personality that I actually liked) fentanyl can evidently as I was told it, &quot;knock the Buprenorphine out of your system&quot; and allow heroin to start hitting you again, as how Subutex works is by clogging up the receptors that heroin or opiates in general latch on to in order to get you high.</p>\n\n<p>It has a real mental impact on people, it needlessly causes damage and anguish, most of which could have been avoided with a courteous breakup, he didn&#39;t care about the end of the relationship nearly as much as the betrayal it&#39;s self. In fact he ended it himself, he hated her, but in his own words &quot;I just couldn&#39;t handle the thought of her fucking another guy while I sat there waiting for her to come home, only to sit there and tell me how she loves me, talk about the wedding, and act like nothing had even happened, it&#39;s the broken trust that hurts the most, and I don&#39;t know if I can ever trust anyone like that again&quot;</p>\n\n<p>All that over a idiotic lustful pursuit, she could have just as easily done after ending the relationship, but instead chose to betray his trust and lie to his face, and he nearly ended his own life over it, if he had his way he would be gone right now</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t confirm that it was the specific reason behind it, but our other closest friend had a 3.5 year relationship end in the same way, he fell into a major depression and the first day he got into his own apartment after it ended, he either relapsed, or took the same avenue, and ended up becoming braindead in his bathroom that very same first night, and had the plug pulled a few days later. We obviously never got to talk to him about it, but he had hinted at being suicidial before it happened, we did everything we could to try and help him when we had the chance, but it didn&#39;t help, and I can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s yet another that could have been avoided, if people had quit being massive fucking assholes, and just told the truth and ended it when they wanted to move on</p>\n\n<p>These two were like brothers to me, we grew up together, we went through the hell that is addiction together, and we got clean together, and I&#39;m almost certain I would be dead right now if I had lost them earlier on. Instead I&#39;ve watched one attempt to kill himself, and fail, and the other either relapse, or make that same decision, and both of them almost certainly could have been avoided if there people decided not to be greedy lustful assholes, and subject the people they claimed to love to the wave of confidence breaking hell, and emotionally devastating betrayal that comes with finding out that the person you loved was fucking someone else behind your back and playing you as a fool the entire time instead of just ending shit and moving on like a decent/healthy person, who actually gives a shit about the damage they inflict on others with their idiotic greedy decisions</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, I guess I&#39;ve been hurt, it&#39;s nearly cost me the two people I can count on in life, but instead I got &quot;lucky&quot; and only had one die instead. Both of which almost certainly could have been avoided by Being a decent person and not forcing the thoughts of infidelity and inferiority on another who you claim to love.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen the hellish damage it can cause to people&#39;s psyche, and hold no forgiveness for the shitty selfish act that is cheating on another person and needlessly causing such vastly higher levels of pain than would have been otherwise experienced by simply ending it with virtually any other excuse, even just saying that you&#39;re no longer happy, will have so much less of an impact than running around on them until you inevitably get caught</p>\n</div>",
