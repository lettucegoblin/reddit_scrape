        "body": "I'm gonna go against the grain here with ESH and I'll tell you why. Calling out Kathy's behaviour was absolutely the right thing to do... it set an example for your children, showed your son that you had his back and all kinds of good stuff like that. But the problem *wasn't* Kathy's level of attractiveness. The problem was that she was sexually harassing your son (in his own home, no less!), irrespective of her appearance. You called Kathy out and protected your son, but, if anything, you've perpetuated the double standard being discussed in the comments. The problem isn't that an unattractive woman was hitting on your son, it's that it was flat out sexual harassment. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy making it an issue about her appearance, you've completely sidestepped teaching your son a valuable lesson: *his discomfort alone is enough reason* to assert himself or seek help from you in shutting this stuff down in your own home. He was wronged, you've just completely missed giving him the words to understand and explain exactly how. Instead of calling Kathy old and ugly, you could have called her *behaviour* out as unwelcome and predatory. Your son needs to know that even if a young, attractive woman repeatedly made unwelcome advances towards him, it would still be just as wrong. Otherwise you're accidentally perpetuating the idea that, if it was a young and attractive woman, it would be welcome no matter what because (implicitly) men always want sex from anyone attractive enough. That is antiquated and damaging bullshit. It also gives Kathy no reason to assess her behaviour, but I won't really count that since teaching her not to be a predator shouldn't be your job.",

If I were in your shoes, I would have chosen to say something more along the lines of what you said to your wife, that she works in a corporate office and knows better, or that she was making your son uncomfortable and that you did not like that and that she needed to stop or leave. You saying she was ugly just hurt her feelings and didn't get the point across that her hitting on him and being inappropriate was uncool and unwelcome. I think not wording things in a way that would make her realize that she was in the wrong is worse than the wording you used honestly, since I doubt she would see this as a situation where she was wrong and will most likely see it as one where you were \"mean\".\n\nShe was absolutely over the line so far that the line was a dot to her. Your wife needs to see this in a less gendered way and see it for what it is: a much older adult who knows better, hitting on a much younger person of the opposite sex and asking them to take their clothes off for their pleasure, and arguing when the younger person said no repeatedly.",

One of my wife\u2019s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren\u2019t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. \n\nWhen we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like \"Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.\" \n\nThis got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. \n\nAt the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. \n\nI told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. \n\nOverall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She was being a creep, bottom line. Harassment is harassment, regardless of gender. I&#39;m surprised your wife thinks it somehow different just cuz it&#39;s a woman harassing a man, or just because it&#39;s a friend doing it. This is her son! And he was clearly uncomfortable (that&#39;s not funny, nor is it cute). Proper respect of her child should take precedence over her friend&#39;s hurt feelings. If anyone should&#39;ve shut her down it should&#39;ve been your wife. I would never allow my child to be made to feel awkward or uncomfortable in their home for anything or anyone.</p>\n</div>",
