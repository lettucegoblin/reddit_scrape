You will still cook, clean and do everything in the home? He thinks he has no job as a parent because he has a job? Guess what, parenting is 24/7, a job is not, and when he gets home, he has to parent. \n\nThis is not who you want to raise a child with, at all. This was a huge reveal of who he is, and you need to believe him and not brush this under the rug or chalk it up to a bad moment. He spent 30 minutes telling you his exact belief system, and when you spoke back, he literally went crying to his mother. \n\nI know you have built a life with this man, and are about to have a child with him, but you deserve a better life than this. If you have a good relationship with your family, I'd talk to them now about how they can help you get out of this marriage and prepare to co parent. \n\nIf you want to consider not having this child- I know people won't say this out loud, so I will- if you have a trusted friend, talk to them and decide your options. You could terminate your pregnancy in secret and say it was a miscarriage.

        "body": "I understand if you want to keep this baby. I really really do. But I would do some really deep introspection on having a baby with this man.\n\nAlso, are his mother and sister even aware of what he said? Tell them, make it very clear. \n\nAlso tell them he better be coming home and settling this with you, right now. Or he\u2019s looking at a divorce. And tell them you are not interested in discussing your relationship with them, and you are disgusted he would just involve other people in your private life like that.\n\nThen give him a day or two max, to come back, tell them this and that you are cutting contact now. Then do it. Do not pick up that phone. He can come home and discuss things with you. It\u2019s your relationship do not allow him to have others berate you on his behalf.\n\nHe needs to come home and settle this with you. And he needs to apologize. Give yourself a time line. You are only 3 weeks. You can abort. I\u2019m sorry but you must at least consider it.\n\nPlease don\u2019t back down on this, it will not get better with time, it won\u2019t change when the baby is here. It will be much much worse for you. \n\nAnd you will have a baby. That means you have to drop school, and you can\u2019t work, and as the situation is at the moment, you can\u2019t afford a baby. \n\nAfter you have the baby, if you then decide to get a divorce or he decides to get one because you refuse to do what he wants (or god forbid gain weight or scars from childbirth or have a pregnancy where you need to be bedridden or post partum depression \u2014 this are common reason why men get a divorce after children, and he can choose to divorce you at any time for any reason) \n\n\u2014- there\u2019s a very real possibility that he can get primary custody. It\u2019s unlikely but possible due to your financial situation. Even if you get primary custody, do you want to be a divorced mom\u2014 to parent a child by yourself? It\u2019s the reality that you are looking at, even if you don\u2019t get a divorce. \n\nReally think if this is what you want. You should not be staying with a man that tell you you have to do things for him (because he\u2019s lazy) because \u201cthis is what is expected of you\u201d and clearly tells you he\u2019s not going to help you with the household or the baby at all, then berates you for half an hour. \n\nAnd tries to guilt trip you, that you should be thankful to him for this because otherwise you would be a bad mother.

Please listen. \n\nAnd reach out to friends and family for support. This type of men will try to isolate you from your support network. There\u2019s a reason for that, and you know what it is.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I understand if you want to keep this baby. I really really do. But I would do some really deep introspection on having a baby with this man.</p>\n\n<p>Also, are his mother and sister even aware of what he said? Tell them, make it very clear. </p>\n\n<p>Also tell them he better be coming home and settling this with you, right now. Or he\u2019s looking at a divorce. And tell them you are not interested in discussing your relationship with them, and you are disgusted he would just involve other people in your private life like that.</p>\n\n<p>Then give him a day or two max, to come back, tell them this and that you are cutting contact now. Then do it. Do not pick up that phone. He can come home and discuss things with you. It\u2019s your relationship do not allow him to have others berate you on his behalf.</p>\n\n<p>He needs to come home and settle this with you. And he needs to apologize. Give yourself a time line. You are only 3 weeks. You can abort. I\u2019m sorry but you must at least consider it.</p>\n\n<p>Please don\u2019t back down on this, it will not get better with time, it won\u2019t change when the baby is here. It will be much much worse for you. </p>\n\n<p>And you will have a baby. That means you have to drop school, and you can\u2019t work, and as the situation is at the moment, you can\u2019t afford a baby. </p>\n\n<p>After you have the baby, if you then decide to get a divorce or he decides to get one because you refuse to do what he wants (or god forbid gain weight or scars from childbirth or have a pregnancy where you need to be bedridden or post partum depression \u2014 this are common reason why men get a divorce after children, and he can choose to divorce you at any time for any reason) </p>\n\n<p>\u2014- there\u2019s a very real possibility that he can get primary custody. It\u2019s unlikely but possible due to your financial situation. Even if you get primary custody, do you want to be a divorced mom\u2014 to parent a child by yourself? It\u2019s the reality that you are looking at, even if you don\u2019t get a divorce. </p>\n\n<p>Really think if this is what you want. You should not be staying with a man that tell you you have to do things for him (because he\u2019s lazy) because \u201cthis is what is expected of you\u201d and clearly tells you he\u2019s not going to help you with the household or the baby at all, then berates you for half an hour. </p>\n\n<p>And tries to guilt trip you, that you should be thankful to him for this because otherwise you would be a bad mother. Then runs away to his moms house. Honey\u2026 no.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot imagine how horrible this must be for you, I can only say as the child of a mother who didn\u2019t have that abortion.

It\u2019s just not about to happen while I can\u2019t stand for too long and have a tiny alien throwing off my balance. It sure as hell won\u2019t happen for her when the baby is born so he can either figure it out or starve \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p>\n</div>",

I realized I would be raising the baby alone and he would likely miss the birth because he was mad at me. I literally am grateful every day I didn\u2019t get pregnant. \n\nHe was abusive and I couldn\u2019t full see it until I left and looked back. There was a point where I would go to get ready for work at 6am and he would yell at me for turning the light on in the bathroom (the light switch was on the outside) and it would wake him up. So i would have to get to the bathroom using the glow from my fitbit (anything else was too bright) and then turn the flashlight on my phone once in the bathroom. Meanwhile when he worked at 6am (when he actually at a job for once and was contributing) he would wake me up to tell me to pull the blanket over my face so he could turn the overhead light on and that was reasonable. \n\nI went offtopic but girl you need to run. Its hard and scary but totally worth it. If he treats you like this he probably wont treat your kid much better. Especially if you end up having a daughter.",

I realized I would be raising the baby alone and he would likely miss the birth because he was mad at me. I literally am grateful every day I didn\u2019t get pregnant. </p>\n\n<p>He was abusive and I couldn\u2019t full see it until I left and looked back. There was a point where I would go to get ready for work at 6am and he would yell at me for turning the light on in the bathroom (the light switch was on the outside) and it would wake him up. So i would have to get to the bathroom using the glow from my fitbit (anything else was too bright) and then turn the flashlight on my phone once in the bathroom. Meanwhile when he worked at 6am (when he actually at a job for once and was contributing) he would wake me up to tell me to pull the blanket over my face so he could turn the overhead light on and that was reasonable. </p>\n\n<p>I went offtopic but girl you need to run. Its hard and scary but totally worth it. If he treats you like this he probably wont treat your kid much better. Especially if you end up having a daughter.</p>\n</div>",
