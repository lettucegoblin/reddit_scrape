From one nurse to another, I genuinely hope you realize that your fiancee&#39;s behavior is unacceptable, is full of red flags for future abuse, and GTFO of there as fast as you can.</p>\n</div>",

For example, an 18 year old who has abusive parents would be very easy prey for an older male to \"rescue\", only for the abuser to turn around and abuse the victim even further (victim feels they can't leave because \"it's not as bad as where I came from\" or out of obligation to their new abuser for \"rescuing\" them from the previous abuser.\n\n-\"Damaged, hurt, lost puppy\" mode.  This works particularly well on nurses, because they present all of their problems and difficulty in life with them being the victim who just needs a good woman to finally come into their life.  We are used to helping people in pain, and wanting to help them get better.  The early red flags can often be explained away by blaming their behavior on some damage they sustained from the \"evil/crazy/abusive ex(es)\" of their past. They don't pay for dates because \"some girl used them for their money\". They need to keep tabs on your location/snoop through texts or emails/control what you wear, who you see, who you can be friends with because \"they have anxiety over all of the women who cheated on them in the past\".\n\nThese guys may not have money of their own because of some \"evil ex who gouges them for child support\"; nurses make good money, and often end up completely financially subsidizing these guys, while also being berated for emasculating them.\n\nSpeaking up against these types has them whimpering that you are \"just like all of the other women who abused them\".
