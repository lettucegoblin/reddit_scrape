My wife and I discussed it and agreed.  She then told me that, because my other siblings hadn't helped out but I had, she was going to pay us 5% of the sale price.

His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.\n\nI was pissed and \"quit\" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.\n\nNow this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. \n\nMy dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.\n\nI declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.\n\nThe family restaurant however, is going under.  \n\nNow there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your Dad has been in business many years, and could have branched more into take-out orders and didnt, that was his business decision he made - not yours.  So sadly that is on him.  His motives are very clear, he is willing to buy out his competition (you), but is he willing to leave you half the business when he dies?  Even if he said he would, there\u2019s no guarantee he wont change his mind in 6 months and change his will again, and you have no say in that.  Yet he wont consider a partnership with you? This would make more sense.\nYour Dad mad his position clear, and didnt change his mind - so now make yours clear, and dont change your mind.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "It's not uncommon for a family business to not be handed down before both spouses are dead. If OP's stepmom had been his bio-mom I don't think OP would've even questioned his father's decision that it would be left to him after the death of both parents.\n\nSo while I feel like OP is NTA for not being cool with the current arrangement I also don't think it's fair to immediately label his dad as someone led only by their dick. Is it so weird that he'd have a pure motive for wanting to make sure his spouse wouldn't be left destitute if he passed? Keep in mind OP sounds young. Let's assume 25. His dad maybe 50ish. If Stepmom is 50 too and dad dies unexpectedly it could be a huge issue to leave her with nothing. If he was without children she could sell the business and possibly survive that way. But since it's supposed to stay in the family this could mean she'd live without a source of income for 40+ years. He is a father, business owner but also a spouse. His wife is his family too and it makes sense he'd want her to be looked after when he's gone. I mean we have no idea what the couple's financial status is and how much they were able to put away for retirement. Owning your own business can be both very lucrative or have you hanging on by a thread.\n\nBut clearly as the 'next gen' restaurant owner OP is a vital part of the future of the business and his feelings should be considered both as a son and as future business owner. And while I think OP is completely right I'm kind of baffled that OP's dad wasn't willing to come to a compromise. Like maybe set a date for your retirement and his prospective 'time' to take over. Then possibly split the business between both his son and wife if he were to leave her a widow young? Or set up some other arrangement?\n\nI don't think OP is wrong at all and dad should've stepped in before things escalated but damn people are painting dad off as the devil with very little info. If it'd been dad's pov everybody would be screaming entitled child from the top of their lungs, especially is stepmom was biomom.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s not uncommon for a family business to not be handed down before both spouses are dead. If OP&#39;s stepmom had been his bio-mom I don&#39;t think OP would&#39;ve even questioned his father&#39;s decision that it would be left to him after the death of both parents.</p>\n\n<p>So while I feel like OP is NTA for not being cool with the current arrangement I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to immediately label his dad as someone led only by their dick. Is it so weird that he&#39;d have a pure motive for wanting to make sure his spouse wouldn&#39;t be left destitute if he passed? Keep in mind OP sounds young. Let&#39;s assume 25. His dad maybe 50ish. If Stepmom is 50 too and dad dies unexpectedly it could be a huge issue to leave her with nothing. If he was without children she could sell the business and possibly survive that way. But since it&#39;s supposed to stay in the family this could mean she&#39;d live without a source of income for 40+ years. He is a father, business owner but also a spouse. His wife is his family too and it makes sense he&#39;d want her to be looked after when he&#39;s gone.

This comment was a response to the OP, who said he was pretty upset about all this because he had big plans for the family business.I was merely suggesting that IF he was still interested in the family business, there is a way the will could be written so that the dad could still ensure the stepmom is taken care of AND leave the business to his son. I wrote the suggestion, because clearly any decision made about the family business by the dad hinges on what happens to the stepmom. This is by no means saying the OP SHOULD even do that, and at this point, it looks like the family business is too far gone anyway for it to make a difference. My suggestion was only out of concern for OP, who still seems like he has an emotional attachment to the family business, even though he has started his own. My top comment makes it clear I think OP is not the asshole, and I think the dad is a jerk for essentially cutting him out of the family business, at least while stepmom is alive.\n\nIn any event, y'all are wild on here",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Exactly. Family doesn\u2019t screw family over. Dad had plenty of time to change his will structure. After OP\u2019s successful venture took off Dad could have said \u201cI see you have a great head for business and I was wrong to exclude you\u201d and tried to change things to leave the business to OP  AND his stepmom (like what a lot of people said, some % of profits can go to her but he runs it). Which would have helped back in September, bc OP mentioned he wanted to shift to more delivery and takeout options and expansion - esp given the current pandemic climate!</p>\n\n<p>But no. Dad doubled down on his AHness and offered to buy OP\u2019s very successful business while his own was failing. Which just seems insulting to me, and doesn\u2019t fix the root of the problem - that the family business which OP has worked for his whole life won\u2019t go to him at all when his dad passes.</p>\n</div>",
