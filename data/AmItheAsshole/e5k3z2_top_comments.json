Turning into a joke is kind of mean. I can count the number of times on one hand in over 10 years of working these jobs where customers  actually are being assholes and not having bad days. That guy with the hot coffee issue may have lost someone close to them, or was fired...you don't know what people are going through and a little empathy can go a long way. \n\nI've had moments where I was being rude to a retail worker because of the day I had and I would feel 10 times worse if i thought someone was fired over it. \n\nIn closing, it's an asshole thing to do, but the malicious side of me still thinks it's funny.\n\nEdit... I've actually been on both sides of this coin. Everyone has bad days, everyone has good days... Fake firing another employee because they were complaining about the temperature of coffee at a coffee place is an a****** offense. There is no justification for being rude to anyone. When I can tell you is, that the people who were rude to me when I was on the clock, but came back and apologized after the fact and offered an explanation for their behavior made the entire experience different because I was able to see from their point of view. Hell, I had a lady threw food at me when I was working in the Drive-Thru. She came up about an hour later crying and told me that she just saw her dog got hit by a car that morning and that she was very sorry. Not everyone who loses their cool is a terrible person. The comment saying I'm an asshole and I'm a terrible person because I lose my cool every once in awhile could learn a lesson like empathy. This will probably get me more hate and more downvotes, but it's something that needs to be shared more. This world is filled with negativity and anger, some justified some not. Making light of somebody's pain or rudeness is not okay, just as it's not okay to lose it on somebody because you have a bad day.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA, but it&#39;s hilarious and I wish I had the balls to do this in my past customer service jobs. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of times you can deescalate the customer in many different ways. Turning into a joke is kind of mean. I can count the number of times on one hand in over 10 years of working these jobs where customers  actually are being assholes and not having bad days. That guy with the hot coffee issue may have lost someone close to them, or was fired...you don&#39;t know what people are going through and a little empathy can go a long way. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had moments where I was being rude to a retail worker because of the day I had and I would feel 10 times worse if i thought someone was fired over it. </p>\n\n<p>In closing, it&#39;s an asshole thing to do, but the malicious side of me still thinks it&#39;s funny.</p>\n\n<p>Edit... I&#39;ve actually been on both sides of this coin. Everyone has bad days, everyone has good days... Fake firing another employee because they were complaining about the temperature of coffee at a coffee place is an a****** offense. There is no justification for being rude to anyone. When I can tell you is, that the people who were rude to me when I was on the clock, but came back and apologized after the fact and offered an explanation for their behavior made the entire experience different because I was able to see from their point of view. Hell, I had a lady threw food at me when I was working in the Drive-Thru. She came up about an hour later crying and told me that she just saw her dog got hit by a car that morning and that she was very sorry. Not everyone who loses their cool is a terrible person. The comment saying I&#39;m an asshole and I&#39;m a terrible person because I lose my cool every once in awhile could learn a lesson like empathy. This will probably get me more hate and more downvotes, but it&#39;s something that needs to be shared more. This world is filled with negativity and anger, some justified some not. Making light of somebody&#39;s pain or rudeness is not okay, just as it&#39;s not okay to lose it on somebody because you have a bad day.</p>\n</div>",

When they got to order, they were already annoyed that it was busy. So they order these two large specialty lattes (like $6 a piece). After they're rung up, we put the ticket on the machine so we can get to the orders in order. A few minutes later, before we've started making it, one of them comes up and asks for hers to be made extra hot. \n\nSo worth noting: the coffee shop I worked at did things different than other chains because it was a small, local, mom & pop shop. We steamed our milk for lattes to about 135-150F instead of 160F+ like other chains because milk burns at those temps and we didn't like to serve burned milk. When customers requested 'extra hot' we would steam to about 160F.\n\nSo I'm making this lady's drink and I steam her milk to 160F. Finish the drink and call it out and move on. She picks it up and goes back to her seat but comes back a minute later practically screaming about how I gave her a cold drink and how it's not hot enough. I ask her if she'd like me to microwave it to heat it up and she's yelling about how she paid and arm and a leg for this so she wants it made fresh and made hotter. So my manager who had been lingering steps in and explains our process of why we don't typically make the drinks hotter than that. The woman will not let my manager get a few words in and keeps yelling about how shitty this place is for charging so much for cold drinks (again, not actually cold at all, just not molten or boiling). So she demands the drink be completely remade and made hotter. \n\nI look at my manager for what to do and she just shrugs and says, \"I guess make it again. And make it super hot.\"\n\nQueue me pulling four more shots and prepping the cup of ingredients and getting the milk ready to steam. I put the milk thermometer in and start stretching and steaming. It passed 130. It passed 140. It kept rising; 160, 170, 180, until finally the milk is bubbling and splattering at about 190. I am barely able to pour this abomination of steamed milk because it's gotten so thick. I call her name again and give her a smile so sweet it could give you cavities, \"Extra hot, as requested.\"\n\nShe took a sip and I saw her physically recoil but she just thanked me and walked away. \n\nMy manger was laughing her ass off in the kitchen afterwards. Glad I didn't get in trouble for totally ruining the customer's drink even though it was legit what she requested.",

As a supervisor, one definitely sees things differently and this is exactly what I was thinking. \n\nAssholes are Assholes, and people will be grumpy with or without you contributing to it. Retail sucks because of this. \n\nHowever;\n\nWhen you are working for a business, you represent the business. Anything an employee does takes its toll on the business, whether that be positive or negative.\n\nI was taught during my young adult years that you cannot change how someone acts. You can only change how you react. By reacting in a manner that de-escalates the situation, you make the other party look like the asshole, you minimize your own stress levels and you end up receiving positive feedback from those around you.\n\nBecause the subs theme is \"asshole\" OP js that asshole, but I would agree with the other reply to this parent comment. OP is the idiot. It's the careless immaturity that is the problem here.",
