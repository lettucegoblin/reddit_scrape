Your roommate has some fucking nerve, you\u2019ve put up with everything he\u2019s thrown at you in a far more chill manner than anyone I know would. First he moves someone else in without even asking if you are ok with it. How are you splitting the costs? Is she paying her share of the rent/bills etc? Or are you being forced to subsidise his gf? Since you say he is going to pay full rent, sounds like you were splitting rent 2 ways still, so this psycho girlfriend isn\u2019t even paying rent to live there and is dictating when you can grab some food or watch TV! Then his imposes a bunch of bizarre rules on you so that you can\u2019t be comfortable in your own home and lectures you when you \u201cslip up\u201d. It\u2019s one thing not to befriend someone and interact more than you need to but yo get chewed out for offering her some water or daring to watch TV while she\u2019s in the room is fucking insane. \n\nLook, whatever his girlfriend\u2019s issues are, they aren\u2019t your problem and you are in no way a creep. He had no right to expect you, while stuck at home all the time, not to use the common areas as and when you wished to while still paying full rent and to feel like you are walking on eggshells in your own home. He thinks you\u2019re the one breaking your agreement with him? Fuck him, what about your agreement that you are entitled to be comfortable in your home. To eat or watch TV and do other reasonable things and not to be constantly berated for existing or feel like you have to hide in your room?! You \u201cagreed\u201d because he didn\u2019t give you a choice, and you don\u2019t owe him anything. If his girlfriend has such major mental issues that she freaks out and can\u2019t handle when another person talks to her or exists in the same space then she shouldn\u2019t be fucking living in a household with other roommates. Living with roommates requires a minimum level of interpersonal interaction with them. He has no right to be subjecting other people to mistreatment to make her comfortable. TLDR don\u2019t feel guilty for a second and tell him to pound sand.",

Your roommate has some fucking nerve, you\u2019ve put up with everything he\u2019s thrown at you in a far more chill manner than anyone I know would. First he moves someone else in without even asking if you are ok with it. How are you splitting the costs? Is she paying her share of the rent/bills etc? Or are you being forced to subsidise his gf? Since you say he is going to pay full rent, sounds like you were splitting rent 2 ways still, so this psycho girlfriend isn\u2019t even paying rent to live there and is dictating when you can grab some food or watch TV! Then his imposes a bunch of bizarre rules on you so that you can\u2019t be comfortable in your own home and lectures you when you \u201cslip up\u201d. It\u2019s one thing not to befriend someone and interact more than you need to but yo get chewed out for offering her some water or daring to watch TV while she\u2019s in the room is fucking insane. </p>\n\n<p>Look, whatever his girlfriend\u2019s issues are, they aren\u2019t your problem and you are in no way a creep. He had no right to expect you, while stuck at home all the time, not to use the common areas as and when you wished to while still paying full rent and to feel like you are walking on eggshells in your own home. He thinks you\u2019re the one breaking your agreement with him? Fuck him, what about your agreement that you are entitled to be comfortable in your home. To eat or watch TV and do other reasonable things and not to be constantly berated for existing or feel like you have to hide in your room?! You \u201cagreed\u201d because he didn\u2019t give you a choice, and you don\u2019t owe him anything. If his girlfriend has such major mental issues that she freaks out and can\u2019t handle when another person talks to her or exists in the same space then she shouldn\u2019t be fucking living in a household with other roommates. Living with roommates requires a minimum level of interpersonal interaction with them. He has no right to be subjecting other people to mistreatment to make her comfortable. TLDR don\u2019t feel guilty for a second and tell him to pound sand.</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019m actually subletting and I\u2019m on my 2nd year which is month-to-month, but we\u2019ve had an unofficial \u201cverbal\u201d agreement that I\u2019d stay until the end of the year. I mean it\u2019s a pandemic, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d move either. \n\nAnyways his gf moved in beginning of this year. It\u2019s been...a lot. She\u2019s obviously had some trauma in the past. I didn\u2019t dig but I believe she was the victim of a home robbery a few years back. Possible other things as well since she lived in a sketchy neighborhood. \n\nWell when she first moved in my roommate had some \u201cground rules\u201d for me so his gf would be more comfortable. She obviously wasn\u2019t thrilled about having another roommate. But I didn\u2019t mind at the time. \n\nHe said I couldn\u2019t talk to her (like strike up a convo) if he wasn\u2019t there because she doesn\u2019t want to have to talk to me if she didn\u2019t have to. He also said it would be best if we tried to not use the same facilities at the same time (like if she\u2019s cooking in the kitchen, I should wait until she leaves before I grab food, etc.) Like yes it\u2019s strange but I figured it\u2019s his place so whatever, we have a big place and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to be besties with her. \n\nThings got worse in recent months cause we\u2019ve all been working from home. It\u2019s REALLY hard to avoid someone 24/7. So obviously I\u2019ve slipped up more and broken some of these rules. One time I came home from grocery shopping and offered her some coconut water from my giant Costco pack. Big mistake. My roommate had to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me that night about how that really upset her and how I should know she would never drink my drinks. \n\nThe most recent one was when she was watching some GoT in our living room. I just stopped and absentmindedly watched a bit standing behind the couch. I got into it and laughed at a scene which startled her when she looked up and saw me standing behind her. I got another earful from my roommate about how I needed to stop \u201ccreeping\u201d on her now that I\u2019m home all the time. \n\nLong story short, my friend just had a place open up that\u2019s cheap and I\u2019m gonna move. I told my roommate and he\u2019s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he\u2019s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn\u2019t gonna move. But I\u2019m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. I shouldn\u2019t feel like a criminal in my own home. AITA for breaking the lease\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I told my roommate and he\u2019s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he\u2019s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn\u2019t gonna move. But I\u2019m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. I shouldn\u2019t feel like a criminal in my own home. AITA for breaking the lease</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The girlfriend clearly has issues whatever the cause and is contributing to OP's need to move.  \n    All I know is that OP isn't in a good situation right now which is no way his fault.   He has gone out of his way to accommodate another guest in his house while it is making his home a place of tension.  That's unfair on OP.  \n\nI definitely had a situation where I lived with my then-partner and his friend , but they often had friends over who weren't me. I didn't want to live there, but he wanted me there and then accused me of talking to and looking at his friends who I was forced to share a space with.   He would grill me about who had spoken to me, who had I seen in the street, what did so and so say to me.   They got told not to speak to me and I got yelled at if I ever got \"caught\" not reporting back to my partner.  It was hell all around.   I'd be screamed at, the friends would be screamed at and then I'd get screamed at some more for \"making him hurt his friends \" or \"making his friends feel unwelcome.\". \n\nI understand that I should have stuck up for myself and for his friends, disregarded the consequence, and just walked out sooner, but I'm ashamed to say that it did get quite bad before I finally got the courage to just get up and run. \n\n  I didn't like making other people uncomfortable. I thought they hated me. They probably did. But apparently they thought that I didn't like them.    That's why I wanted to warn op. If he's in a situation like the friends of my ex, or anything similar, he needs to get out before things get out of hand and he starts feeling majorly uncomfortable being in what should be his sanctuary.  \n\nAnd if the girlfriend is the one making the accusations - a home robbery isn't an excuse- if she were that affected, she could have not moved in with the boyfriend. Or they both could have sat down together. Even if you have trauma from an event in your life, you can't expect everyone else to just blindly accommodate you. It isn't the way the world works.     If strangers make her so uncomfortable, why did she move in with one. And why is she not simply uncomfortable with his being in the house and instead only \"uncomfortable\" when OP speaks ? (That last part brings me back around to thinking that it's the boyfriend again ).",
