I am on track to be a SAHM, but I\u2019m also 26 and have an amazing husband. \n\nWhen I was 16, I had a massive meltdown at my parents because I didn\u2019t see the point into going 10s of thousands of dollars into debt when all I wanted was to be a SAHM. My parents ended up pulling the \u201cI\u2019m a parent and you\u2019re going\u201d card I picked a school I really loved and met my husband there when we were 18. I would not have met him if I had stayed home instead of gone to school (it was out of state). Neither one of us were mature enough for marriage or kids, let alone being the kind of independent it would have taken for me to drop out of college and stay home with him. \n\nI graduated from a pretty good university with a bachelors in Spanish. It\u2019s not directly applicable to a lot, but it\u2019s universally helpful. My bachelors degree has helped me with so much. I had to work part-time through college where I learned customer service skills, random stuff (I was a floral assistant) and eventually ended up as a swim teacher which was amazing. That job led me to figure out that I wanted to work with kids in some capacity. \n\nI graduated when I was 22, married my husband that fall and moved to his home town. I couldn\u2019t find work for about 6 months, so I finally got a job waiting tables. I learned the ins and outs and got a better job at a better restaurant. There, I met a woman who offered to hire me because of my personality, but I had to have a bachelors degree to work in her field. It was completely unrelated to my studies (accounting) but I took it because waiting tables was slowly crushing me. \n\nI earned enough at that job that, combined with our low COL, my husband and I were able to move to DC for a year as our last hurrah before we bought a house and started a family. During my year in DC, I got a job in childcare and was unexpectedly promoted to lead teacher in my classroom when my lead teacher quit. The only reason this was possible was because of my bachelors degree. I made enough of a raise that we were able to save up again, move back to his home town and buy a house, just after I turned 26. We moved in May, got pregnant in June, and I haven\u2019t had to work since I quit my childcare job. I also won\u2019t have to work ever unless we hit some crazy financial hardship or want to take insane vacations every year. \n\nMy bachelors degree has opened doors for me. I also would not have been able to find someone mature enough for children when I was 18, and my parents would never have let me stay home without working. My advice would be to find a job you think you might enjoy. I\u2019ve seen recommendations for hospitality, but I\u2019d also encourage childcare of some kind. These jobs will teach you valuable life skills, might give you an idea of an educational path you want to take (I\u2019ve seen community colleges that offer certificates and associates degrees for early childhood education.) I learned so much, especially in my childcare job, I feel like I\u2019m much better prepared for children now than I ever could\u2019ve imagined at 18.\n\nTL;DR use this time to develop and hone skills that will help you when you\u2019re a SAHM. Save up a ton of money so you can be set when you want a house or need a bigger car or decide on post-secondary education. Most guys your age won\u2019t be mature enough to handle a family at all, let alone completely financially supporting one while you stay home. Learn how to run a house, manage finances, and whatever you can now to help you out in the future.\n\nEdit: saw another comment that made me remember another piece of advice for later. When you (daughter) meet the partner of your dreams, make it clear early on (whenever the talk about future/marriage/kids comes up) that you want to be a SAHM so you can make plans towards that. When we bought our house, we made sure that we could afford it and everything else on husbands income alone. It meant tightening the belt in a couple places for a couple years, but now we\u2019re in a place financially where me staying home next spring won\u2019t be a scramble",

I help women who had the plan your daughter does allllll the time. It sounds like your DD doesn't yet have a grasp of the real world (what teenager does, really?) Something that people are often unaware of is how prevalent and damaging financial abuse is. This is even more true in relationships where one spouse is young and unable to support themselves. It's one of the main reasons people stay in abusive relationships: they can't support themselves and choose to risk the abuse in exchange for financial security. What I'm trying to say is that your daughter's attitude puts her at a higher risk for abuse down the line, and that it will be harder for her to escape than it is for women who are gainfully employed.\n\nMy advice is to focus less on the \"what will you do if your rich military husband dies and you need to support the family?!\" and more on \"how can you pursue the lifestyle you're after in a way that will limit your potential for an abusive situation?\" Focus on how empowering it can be to have and make your own money. Stress that even SAHMs have financial needs, and that they frequently get overlooked in favor of the kid's needs if the mom doesn't have the ability to cover those costs. How will she protect herself from dependence or abuse? How will she pay for things like getting her nails done? How can she be sure she'll still be able to be generous to others through gifts? Basically I\"m suggesting you step away from the \"this is a bad decision\" talk and move toward \"what will your quality of life look like under this arrangement?\"",

Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor.\nMy annual income is more than $500k, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I\u2019m not wasting time here.\nFrom the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain.\nPut the details aside, what you\u2019re trying to do is an exchange of \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cmoney\u201d : Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square.\nHowever, there\u2019s a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can\u2019t be prettier year after year.\nHence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It\u2019s not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worse 10 years later.\nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a \u201ctrading position\u201d.\nIf the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term - same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or \u201cleased\u201d.\nAnyone with over $500k annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with $500k annual income.This has better chance than finding a rich fool.\nHope this reply helps.\nsigned,\nJ.P. Morgan CEO",

Assuming she follows normal development from adolescence to adulthood, she'll come out of her \"invincibility fallacy\" cognition eventually, but as a parent you definitely shouldn't wait it out. Real life doesn't wait for brain maturation. \n\nThis isn't an advice subreddit I know, so read what I'm about to say if you like.\n\nI'm going to touch on this commenter's idea to get a degree in early childhood development because this may be a good middle ground for your daughter. \n\nIn summary: getting a degree related to taking care of children provides her with education and experience to fall back on while giving her knowledge that actively makes being a SAHM easier (or if not easier, more manageable). \n\nMy degree is in Child Development. And I am so glad to have the knowledge that comes with it as I prepare for my first child! Academic and professional knowledge provide so much confidence in my own ability to parent once my baby is born. I'm more clued in about developmental concerns and bringing them up to my doctor if need be, about activities that are safe and beneficial to kid's learning, and how to evaluate headlines in the news that are meant to scare parents and understanding what the study actually demonstrates or does not demonstrate. And that's just touching on the knowledge that I personally value most that I gained from my degree when applying to my family life. \n\nIf she wants to be a SAHM, her degree of course sets her up to take care of her children. But if she really wants, she could reputably set up an at home daycare. She'd actually be able to stay at home and bring in money! That's not as easy as it sounds, but it's a possibility if she's willing to put herself out there. (This all assumes that she marries a good person and not somebody that would sabotage her efforts like this commenter I'm replying to is likely worried about). \n\nAnd unless she specifically gets a teaching degree, degrees like early childhood development, child development, etc, won't streamline her to only one type of job. These are good degrees if she wants to work with kids but doesn't know in what capacity. (That's actually why I first chose the degree when entering university). A competent program and advisors will both help her explore what she wants to do with the degree. And there is...relative...ease in switching professions. For example, I was working with children with developmental disabilities (basically as a highly qualified paraprofessional) for a few years. When I needed (slightly) more flexibility in my life, it was fairly easy to switch to nannying. And I am taken more seriously as a nanny because of my degree and previous experience. She may need to get some additional certification and experience depending on the switch, but there are some career switches that won't require her to get another degree.\n\nIf what this commenter says comes to light for your daughter (marrying an abuser because the abuser identifies her as easy to manipulate and stay with them), degrees or education in just about any human services field should be educating students to the signs of abuse and what steps can be taken to get out of a situation like that. Having a degree and job mitigates some risk of being trapped in an abusive relationship or marriage. But being a SAHM without any independent source of income does put her at risk of financial abuse at minimum. \n\nVeering away from her education, if you do ever let her stay with you, i recommend that you charge her rent and utilities as you see fit. Be slightly more flexible when you see that she is working hard and making her own way. Whatever your conditions are, make them clear, put them in writing, and be consistent.",

Having a degree and job mitigates some risk of being trapped in an abusive relationship or marriage. But being a SAHM without any independent source of income does put her at risk of financial abuse at minimum. </p>\n\n<p>Veering away from her education, if you do ever let her stay with you, i recommend that you charge her rent and utilities as you see fit. Be slightly more flexible when you see that she is working hard and making her own way. Whatever your conditions are, make them clear, put them in writing, and be consistent.</p>\n</div>",

People think that psychopaths and narcissists are easy to identify because they treat people like crap and are only out for themselves but the truth is that most people who know them think they're great people who are very kind. Love bombing is effective as hell to create loyal alliances - it works not only for creating romantic relationships but platonic, professional, and cult-like ones too. They are HARD to identify especially if you don't know the characteristics that come with these personality disorders. I can't tell you how many people told me they adored my narcissist parent and fell over themselves to spend time with them while my parent was avoiding and shit talking them behind their backs.  \n\nThey do very kind things but only to boost their ego, make themselves look superior, or to get something. They refuse to genuinely admit to faults and always have a reason that their actions were ok. If you end up in a relationship with one and do manage to get out they most likely caused you tremendous psychological damage which leaves you vulnerable to future abusive situations. They only show their true colors to those who have no way out and have fallen completely for them, because they know they can get away with it at that point. Accepting that someone you care for isn't who you thought they were and that you need to end the relationship with them for your own mental or even physical safety is extremely difficult. That person made you feel love on a level that you probably never felt before, at a level that is euphoric and addicting. Losing that is tremendously painful. \n\nThat's why abusive relationships and cults are just so hard to get out of. Not because some girl is just being a masochist and stupidly going back to the wife beater - but because it genuinely is a fucked up situation that is a true battle to get out of. Once she goes back she'll be love bombed again for a while and when the abuser thinks it's safe he'll go right back to treating her like garbage and the cycle will continue. It's so fucked up.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Definitely teach her about love bombing. People think that psychopaths and narcissists are easy to identify because they treat people like crap and are only out for themselves but the truth is that most people who know them think they&#39;re great people who are very kind. Love bombing is effective as hell to create loyal alliances - it works not only for creating romantic relationships but platonic, professional, and cult-like ones too. They are HARD to identify especially if you don&#39;t know the characteristics that come with these personality disorders.

OP is NTA for telling her daughter that\u2019s ridiculous and encouraging her to have marketable skills to protect herself and her future children. \n\nMy sister was the same way. All she would ever answer when someone asked what she wanted to be when she grew up was \u201ca mom.\u201d My parents made her get a job and go to college (though she only finished a two year degree since that\u2019s all they asked for). She now has her baby and has a decent job, and she knows she could support herself if she needed to. If they didn\u2019t live beyond their means she could be a stay at home mom, but she decided that she actually doesn\u2019t want to once she had a kid. \n\nSome people do just want to be a parent.

OP is NTA for telling her daughter that\u2019s ridiculous and encouraging her to have marketable skills to protect herself and her future children. </p>\n\n<p>My sister was the same way. All she would ever answer when someone asked what she wanted to be when she grew up was \u201ca mom.\u201d My parents made her get a job and go to college (though she only finished a two year degree since that\u2019s all they asked for). She now has her baby and has a decent job, and she knows she could support herself if she needed to. If they didn\u2019t live beyond their means she could be a stay at home mom, but she decided that she actually doesn\u2019t want to once she had a kid. </p>\n\n<p>Some people do just want to be a parent.

Many of them have basically no social life because they\u2019re home with the babies all day. They don\u2019t go out. It\u2019s like pandemic quarantine for YEARS until the kids are old enough to be well behaved in public. On a single income, most of them can\u2019t afford regular babysitters and most of their husbands would absolutely NEVER take care of the kids because they work all day and win the bread, so why should they do the woman\u2019s job? (In their minds). \n\nMany of them are stir-crazy and lonely as all get out. Plus in most of those cases, the husband controls the finances since he\u2019s the one making the money. So even if they had the interest and motivation in doing something like getting a certification, taking online classes, enrolling in a community college, or anything else that costs money, they need to ask their husband permission and get approval first. \n\nIt\u2019s like living as a child or a prisoner when you\u2019re a fully-functioning, competent adult. It must be miserable to have so little freedom and ownership over your own life. \n\nThat said, my advice to OP is to get her daughter to have a little taste of appropriate freedom. Does she have her license? If not, make her get it, and give her regular access to a car. Make her get a minimum wage job is she\u2019s over 16 years old. Tell her that her money that she earns is hers to do whatever she wants with. \n\nMy parents made me get a job and my license at 16 and once I started earning my own money, I was addicted. I realized I could go out with my friends without asking permission. My social life thrived. I learned how to save money so I could buy myself my very own MacBook computer that ended up lasting me almost a decade, through college and grad school. After that, I saved to travel. I paid for my own trips to Ireland, Paris, and London. I spent the days leading up to Christmas with my boyfriend at his family\u2019s Florida home and knew my parents couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t say no because I bought the flights with my own money that I earned with the job I had in grad school. I went to Disney World for the first time at 22 years old. I spent New Year\u2019s Eve in NYC at a glamorous multi-level open bar with a rooftop 2 years in a row because I wanted to. It didn\u2019t matter that it cost $150 because it was MY money. I got so addicted to that freedom that now I know I can never go back. When you\u2019re dependent on someone else financially, it also means you\u2019re obligated to live your life on their terms. In a sense, they own you. They can put conditions on the money that you need to LIVE, and that is just a horrible way to live.\n\nAbusers also prey on people like that. Abusers like to control people who want to be dependent and comfortable and it can go from a perfect fairy-tale marriage to an abusive nightmare so quickly. OPs daughters plan isn\u2019t just naive and poorly thought-out; it\u2019s dangerous.",

However, before he met me, all his girlfriends were girls who were cashiers at Walmart, or other such jobs that didn't require any education. They had usually failed out of high school. They were incredibly fun, and decent looking. But when he was with them, he wasn't being challenged to grow as a person or on his career. He came from poverty himself and his family didn't particularly value education, so he didn't think he even deserved a girlfriend with ambition and who had significant income. He didn't mind paying for most things, and those girls didn't have expensive taste so it worked out.\n\nBut after a point he realized that type of girlfriend was dragging him down. They were nice people, but the level of thinking didn't bode for a good life ahead. He didn't want to marry them or have kids with them. They were just fun to come home to after a long day of using his brain all day, and he appreciated that they had a vibrant social circle that he didn't have to put effort into maintaining. But they were just happy with him as he was, which is nice, but he wanted to have input from someone else on life decisions, and he realized he didn't value their input on life decisions. \n\nWe're married with children and a mortgage, and his family tells me they are amazed at how he's turned his life around after meeting me, even doing better than his brother who is more on the straight and narrow. I don't think it's me, though I support him through all his ambitions. He just decided he wanted a different life, where he works jobs that paid better, owned things, lived out his career goals, and had different conversations. I just happened to fit in with that. (And he happened to fit in with my ambitions as well, which involved having a partner who helps me be better at my career). \n\nIf you want to marry someone successful, you've to figure out how they'll see you fit into their success. Maybe in an earlier generation, men of some means didn't mind someone low on ambition and education as a partner because they just needed someone to keep house. But now, men think more about being part of a power couple, where they can leverage two incomes into finding a better life, with a partner who can fit into their group of friends, and who will help them manage their career better.",

I can't fathom doing that even now, and I'm only 3 years deep into a 10+ year education. my mom is technically private practice and only gets a few weeks off a year, dad lives and works in Beverly Hills at Cedars and I dunno what his schedule is like, I only see him a few times a year for summer vacations and Christmas, mostly. but growing up I didn't see much of them anyway. your situation with your husband sounds great, very practical and I'm sure your kids love having you around and involved in their lives. my childhood was less than ideal as both of my parents are on the NPD spectrum but I just remember a recurring thought growing up of how much I wished my parents were \"normal\" even if I didn't really have a frame of reference as to what \"normal\" was. only when I hit high school and made friends that had normal, happy, married parents did I actually figure out my childhood was glaringly abnormal and I spent every moment I could at my best friend's house. her mom was a SAHM  and had her own Etsy business (I've bought from her many times as an adult) and her dad was a firefighter and their marriage and familial dynamic was AMAZING. I loved hanging out over there. they accepted me as one of their own and it was nice to be part of a functional family unit.",
