An even bigger red flag is punishing a child for wanting his mothers things instead of hers. This is out right abuse, denying a child something because its not what she wants. Your child is not safe with either the father or his girlfriend and if i was you i would be worried about leaving him alone with them. You need to get a lawyer involved or something like family courts. It seems this woman wants to replace you and honestly women like this can go to some pretty terrible extremes. The fact your ex is not listening is also worrying.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA but you really need to think what this woman is doing. She is trying to dictate to you and your child how to raise them. Thats a huge red flag. An even bigger red flag is punishing a child for wanting his mothers things instead of hers. This is out right abuse, denying a child something because its not what she wants. Your child is not safe with either the father or his girlfriend and if i was you i would be worried about leaving him alone with them. You need to get a lawyer involved or something like family courts. It seems this woman wants to replace you and honestly women like this can go to some pretty terrible extremes. The fact your ex is not listening is also worrying.

I got a divorce and we share custody of our 3 yro old son. My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on stuff my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her \"house\" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.\n\n\nI made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.\n\n\nI sent my son to stay with his dad days ago and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I font know exactly what happened but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as \"punishment\" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other see what she did.\n\nMy ex husband called me yelling about my pathetic attempt to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background whole he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her \"future inlaws\". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible,it even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, try taking your little guy to a play therapist, that will help him & help you to know exactly how to handle this situation around him. I wouldn't be surprised if he does take you to court it is only to get child support dropped. But CS & visiting have nothing to do with one another. You can also check with your local child support enforcement through social services, they can handle that aspect for you & it costs you nothing. It all goes through their workers & they handle the court costs & such. Have all of your ducks in a row; documents printed of emails, text messages & vm. If your son starts play therapy, have a report from the therapist. And maybe offer visitation for the father only, supervised by you or a court ordered advocate, that he has to pay for. The gf should not even be considered until & if they marry. Also, while his family seem to be very supportive of you, and that's a wonderful thing, tread lightly.

        "body": "Throwing out the blanket was not okay, I agree. But the kid doesn't know or care what her title is. She's lived with him as much of the time as his father has, since he was born. She does the parenting tasks, and there's nothing OP can do to stop her from doing those, because they happen at a house where OP is not present at the time. \n\nAll of this is going to make the kid see her as a parent, no matter what title adults use for her. Trying to get him to see her otherwise is only going to confuse him and upset him. \n\nSo is the war between mother and stepmother over whom the child loves. Left to his own devices, he would almost certainly love them both; children are wired to love anybody who is actively parenting them. \n\nThis is the best outcome for the child -- both adults stop yanking him back and forth between them, and collaborate, together with his father, on raising him.

I also don't think it's inevitable that it will continue, depending on how the stepmother is treated. \n\nI know you don't believe me that these are the options, but let's do a thought experiment for a minute. It's your child, and your only options are the following: \n\n1) a magic card which has one chance in fifty of making the abuser go *POOF* in a puff of smoke and disappear forever, but 40 chances in 50 of making the abuse much worse for the rest of the child's minor years\n\n2) a magic card which will not affect the abuser's position in the child's life, but has a 50-50 chance of inducing them not to abuse him any more. You'd still have to live with them, they'd still exist, but now they wouldn't do any worse than an average stepparent. \n\nIgnore that you don't think those are the options in this case; if you did, might you see the value of that second card? \n\nThe difference here between us is simply that I have a different view from yours about what is possible. From my own experience and those I've observed, I think it's much more probable that a stepparent who is being emotionally abusive out of jealousy because she wants to be accepted as one of the child's parents can be made to cease abusing if she gets that acceptance, than I think it is probable that OP is really going to be able to persuade the family court system to force the stepmother out of the game. \n\nSo I go with the more likely option to be effective. If you believe the odds are different of what will be effective, that would make it reasonable for you to prefer a different tactic. \n\nBut I caution against wishful thinking. Just because it would be lovely to be able to triumphantly tell the court, \"She wouldn't let him have a blanket!\" and have them cast her out with all due horror doesn't mean that it's actually going to happen. I've seen family courts in action for 15 years, and they have seen a *lot* more damage than that without considering it grounds to forcibly change a custody plan.",

This is like saying &quot;when r*** is inevitable one must just lie back and endure it without a fight to limit the damage&quot;. How can anyone even say such things?</p>\n</div>",

I reacted about the way this mother is reacting to a jealous GF who tried to take my kids away from me and put them in a difficult position by so doing. It was up to me to take them out of that position since I couldn't make her do it. The result wasn't ideal, but it was better than constant fighting. \n\nAnd no, not all situations are the same. It's certainly possible that if she tries to welcome the GF, it won't make anything better and she'll have to resort to the courts in the end. But frankly, that's going to put her in a much better position to have a ghost of a chance of succeeding in the courts, which she does not have right now. \n\nThe \"fight tooth and nail\" strategy isn't going to work. Will the \"invite her to be stepmother and guide her in being a good one?\" strategy work? Maybe, maybe not. If it doesn't, what happens then? Quite possibly, nothing except ongoing wrangling, even though it is bad for the kid, because maybe there is no solution to this case that can possibly help. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if nothing will work.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I didn&#39;t try to push the GF out. I reacted about the way this mother is reacting to a jealous GF who tried to take my kids away from me and put them in a difficult position by so doing. It was up to me to take them out of that position since I couldn&#39;t make her do it. The result wasn&#39;t ideal, but it was better than constant fighting. </p>\n\n<p>And no, not all situations are the same. It&#39;s certainly possible that if she tries to welcome the GF, it won&#39;t make anything better and she&#39;ll have to resort to the courts in the end. But frankly, that&#39;s going to put her in a much better position to have a ghost of a chance of succeeding in the courts, which she does not have right now. </p>\n\n<p>The &quot;fight tooth and nail&quot; strategy isn&#39;t going to work. Will the &quot;invite her to be stepmother and guide her in being a good one?&quot; strategy work? Maybe, maybe not. If it doesn&#39;t, what happens then? Quite possibly, nothing except ongoing wrangling, even though it is bad for the kid, because maybe there is no solution to this case that can possibly help. </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if nothing will work.
