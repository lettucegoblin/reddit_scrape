His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn\u2019t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn\u2019t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn\u2019t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home).

People who assume consent are people who don't care about consent, and so if he did say no, truthfully I don't think you would have stopped because it was 'A stupid game'. \n\nAlso you've said in the comments that kissing without consent and touching a boob without consent isn't the same thing, I can tell you that sexual assault doesn't play favourites with body parts. I was kissed without consent and I feel gross for it. My boob was touched without consent and I feel gross for it. It's the same. I wish getting kissed without consent felt nice, but it doesn't because it's terrible.\n\n'But I know him' shut up. That's a terrible argument, I knew my assaulted and guess what? They were decent looking too, but that doesn't stop assault being assault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou desperately need a reality check and need someone to sit you down and teach you about consent and how if you don't say yes, you don't say okay. If you laugh, that is not consent. If you stay silent, that is not consent. Truthfully I don't think you can fix what you did except for learn from this and grow because why anyone would forgive you is beyond me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, in case you didn't gather: **YTA**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**P.S** I'm a girl and my assaulter was too a girl, so please don't say it's different for girls, because it's not.

U are effectively asking us to tarnish the reputation of this Subreddit, and skew our honest judgements in your favour. This seems to be because u want ur friends to believe (falsely) that strangers are all supporting u in ur argument about the kiss.\n\nU are clearly young, so I don't judge u as much as I would judge an adult. But there are hard lessons that everyone has to learn, at some point in their lives. Two of those lessons are: a) learning to take responsibility for ur own actions, and b) learning not act in an entitled way. \n\nU are not taking self-responsibility, in trying to guilt us into hiding the negative judgements. U ask whether we would be 'ok' with getting comments full of YTAs, and our friends laughing as a result. U are clearly trying to make us responsible for the consequences of YOUR choices, by saying that. \n\nNaturally, most people don't enjoy getting YTAs - but yes, most people would at least be 'ok' with it. They would be 'ok' with it, because they CHOSE to ask us for honest opinions, KNOWING the judgement might not go in their favour.

For example, u repeat ur request (for us to help skew the public judgement in ur favour) several times - apparently still unaware that it's very inappropriate to do so. \n\nWhen commentators will not do that, u then run to the moderators, saying that it's 'urgent'. That's crazy. What the heck did u expect the moderators to say?!  Did u expect them to go against the rules of this Subreddit, so u can have the public results faked?! \n\nThe fact u even had the guts to go to the moderators, demonstrates ur problem taking responsibility for ur own choices.

Not okay.\n\n*However* - although I'll probably get downvoted to Reddit hell for saying it - I feel that the actual violation of consent, that has happened here, is not *exactly* what the majority of commenters here seem to think it is.\n\nI think that there may be two kinds of consent, that are possible and both valid - in lack of a better term I'd call them *explicit* and *implicit* consent - and although the second one might be a bit of a slippery slope and makes misunderstandings a little easier, I do think that it shouldn't be entirely dismissed.\n\nFor example: Imagine you are married to someone and in this marriage it's established and mutually understood that sex is to be a part of it and will happen, so advances in this direction are expected and okay and you'll not ask for *explicit* consent every single time, because you have the type of relationship, that *implies* a general consent to these things.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong! I'm not implying in the slightest, that there's no such thing as getting raped while married or anything. Explicit (dis-)consent overrides implicit consent *every single time*. There are no exceptions! If you had sex with someone a thousand times and the next time you get obviously rejected or simply told 'No!', then you gotta back off.\n\nWhat I'm saying, though - and to get back to topic - is that if you willingly and knowingly participate in a relationship and/or situation where consent to certain actions is implied, it doesn't exactly suffice to \"just not say anything\" or \"laugh it off\" to signal missing consent. \n\nThat said, to be dared to kiss someone or someone to be dared to kiss you (even or especially someone you don't particularly care to kiss) is pretty standard for a game of truth or dare and by participating, you agree to the rules. It'd be even more ridiculous to require *explicit* consent every single time if they were playing spin the bottle.\n\nTo wrap it up: By participating in a game like this, you accept to participate in the standard behavior that's implied by the rules. If you don't like that in a particular instance, you gotta speak up!\n\nOf course, like I said, OP is still TA as the dare was retracted, so her actions weren't covered by the rules and she had no reason to expect consent from her friend's brother.",

There are plenty of reasons why a person might have an extremely negative reaction to what you did to that boy, and those reasons shouldn't need to be spelled out for you. But evidently they do, so here are a few:\n\n- Maybe he has a medical condition that makes what you did riskier for him than for a normal person.\n- Maybe he has a religious and/or philosophical objection.\n- Maybe he was sexually assaulted in his past and you triggered memories of that incident (not to mention added another to his memory).\n- Maybe it was his first kiss and he wanted to have that moment with someone special to him.\n- Maybe a girl he likes was in the room, so he didn't want to kiss anyone else in front of her.\n- Maybe at his point of physical development, kissing anybody under any condition is still nothing but utterly disgusting and you made him freak out or even gag.\n- Maybe at his point of physical development, being kissed had the potential to cause an automatic bodily reaction outside his control that would've humiliated him in front of everybody.\n- Maybe he has an anxiety disorder that makes participating in regular social situations hard enough as it is for him.\n- Maybe he was quietly dealing with a headache or stomach ache because he didn't want to be a bother, so jumping at him made that discomfort suddenly swell and made him lose his concentration.\n\nMaybe 1,000 other reasons that aren't excused by your failure to imagine even one. All you had to do was *not* touch him without his consent, as you and everybody you know has been taught over and over again.\n\nAlso, I'm a very trusting person and try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I don't trust you one bit. \"Send the YTAs to me in private messages,\" you say? I suspect that you were hoping to show your friend a thread full of people on your side and never mention the YTAs filling your inbox. It wouldn't have worked anyway: posts are immediately copied in their originally submitted form by bots, so when you would've come back to quietly remove your little request, it still would've been there in the copy. Just FYI.\n\nInstead of trying to come up with ways to defend what you did and artificially cultivate a thread of people agreeing with you, what you need to do is spend some time reflecting on what happened until you feel ashamed instead of defensive. Then, you need to apologize to him \u2013 and it needs to be a *good* apology. That means no \"I'm sorry *you* didn't like it\" or any other BS. Furthermore, it should be a written apology because your physical presence could be very painful for him, depending on the reason behind his reaction.

With this in mind, I assume OP and all friends involved are pretty young. Old enough to be interested in flirty dating type stuff but too young to understand how to navigate the nuances and handle uncomfortable situations.  Basically, teenagers.\n\nBack in the dark ages of the 20th century when teenagers my age played the game, it was not only understood that some level of flirty activity or touching came with the territory, it was part of the point. Again, dumb teenagers. Socially awkward and inexperienced people playing with fire. Nothing egregious, mind you, but like kiss so-and-so, etc. was par for the course. Not to say it was smart because we were all socially dumb and learning how to navigate social shit while being full of stupid hormones that make you crazy.\n\nI agree with your thought that the game is outdated now. If they absolutely insist on playing though, it would be better for everyone to discuss the ground rules and limits of the game before participating and giving everyone a chance to opt in or out before starting, and even so if someone isn't comfortable they should be able to decline any task at any time. Ideally OP should have been able to read the cues that the brother was not interested, particularly after sister said change it AND the person changed the dare. Then again, if everyone involved is high school age, it's pretty easy to imagine OP blundering through it and not realizing how offensive her actions were. \n\nI agree with a soft YTA, but I think people equating it to full on sexual assault are being a bit over the top, ASSUMING they are all dumbass teenagers who agreed to play the game and OP learns from it. OP is still wrong to follow through after the multiple pushbacks, but I think that is mostly due to inexperience.\n\n\n*minor edits for clarity and syntax*",

Ideally OP should have been able to read the cues that the brother was not interested, particularly after sister said change it AND the person changed the dare. Then again, if everyone involved is high school age, it&#39;s pretty easy to imagine OP blundering through it and not realizing how offensive her actions were. </p>\n\n<p>I agree with a soft YTA, but I think people equating it to full on sexual assault are being a bit over the top, ASSUMING they are all dumbass teenagers who agreed to play the game and OP learns from it. OP is still wrong to follow through after the multiple pushbacks, but I think that is mostly due to inexperience.</p>\n\n<p><em>minor edits for clarity and syntax</em></p>\n</div>",

It seems like OP is trying to defend a mistaken assertion that what they did was ok because they misread social queues, but what they have to realize that it\u2019s not about what they think, it\u2019s about how their actions are perceived by those around them.  That\u2019s social interaction 101, which is something that everyone should learn at some point, hopefully earlier than their teens, and not in such a dramatic way, though.\n\nSorry OP, YTA in this one, I hope you do the right thing and apologize to your friends, you can do so by accepting responsibility for your actions, not trying to redirect the blame to them.  Your misstep is yours, not theirs, accept this and explain to them that you misread the situation and made a mistake, ask them for forgiveness, but also be willing to accept that they may not be ready forgive you yet.  Show them through action, not just words, that you take their feelings seriously.  Regaining trust takes time and effort, I hope you understand this and decide to do the right thing.\n\nSorry for the hijacked hijack, it\u2019s important for people not to just to recognize their mistakes, but to also to understand what caused them, so they don\u2019t repeat them in the future.",
