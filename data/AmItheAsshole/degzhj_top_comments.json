If everyone else is entitled to having their partners, you are too. Period. \n\nI'm assuming he's not eating/showering/waking them up etc and if that's the case then tell her to fuck off. If he is eating their food, using utilities that they're paying for or waking them I can understand the frustration but not the ban - it would be your responsibility to cover the extra. If their partners are eating your food, running up the bills or waking you up, you have every right to bitch too and demand payment on their half. IF that's the case.\n\nAgain, you're not the asshole, she is and she sounds homophobic which is a her problem and she can see herself out.

You understand that your new BF is possibly the straw that broke that camels back by making this place seem crowded, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t stay while others can. What rules could you all agree to that can be put in place to make everyone&#39;s lives easier and can apply to everyone. EG is 2 evening a week OK? 3? any days people would like avoided? how do nights vary? (I guess 26F&#39;s BF uses the shower).</p>\n\n<p>Basically it&#39;s up to you, but recognise you are making things difficult (so is 16F). How long is left on your lease?</p>\n\n<p>Im trying to void the assumption of homophobia here. you know them best to determine that.</p>\n\n<p>Solution - buy 26F out of the lease, move your boyfriend in instead.</p>\n</div>",

For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nAbout six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \n\nSo the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nMy potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are still young, you may not fully understand all your rights as a tenant yet, and your older roommate is using that against you. Have have every legal right to enjoy your place as yours. Don\u2019t be bullied by her. Just bring boyfriend over as often as you\u2019d like/is specified in the lease. It probably shouldn\u2019t even be a problem with the lease because he\u2019s not often over for the night. 26f might actually be in violation of the lease because many stipulate a maximum number of nights a non tenant can stay per month. If she continues to be a problem, bring it to her attention that you will be reporting her to the landlord and she could face eviction.</p>\n</div>",
