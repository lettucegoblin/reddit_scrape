He had gotten in trouble, similar to your son; and his dad had really gotten his ass for it. His dad made a bunch of threats about what would happen if he got in trouble again. He got a ticket, his dad was out of town, he went home, left his truck door wide open, walked in the house, and shot himself. It was thanksgiving day. </p>\n\n<p>I say all this to agree- your kids should always know you\u2019re a safe place to turn to. Yes, they may get in trouble in the light of the next day, but they\u2019ll be safe.</p>\n</div>",

So one day when my parents were gone I invited this guy over to watch a UFC fight with my boyfriend and I. \n\nWe had brought a couple of drinks just to enjoy over a few hours and some snacks and stuff. I let the coworker pour a round for all of us. That was my second drink of the night. \n\nTo sum it up he roofied my boyfriend and I in my own home. My parents ended up coming home about 4-5 hours later and in fear of them I packed up everything and my boyfriend drove us to his house on the rural backroads. We were barely conscious at that point. Coworker kept trying to get me to go with him. We definitely shouldn't have been driving, but at that point we were still so drugged we weren't in our right minds. Made it to my boyfriends and collapsed into bed and instantly fell asleep. I woke up 2 hours later to my boyfriends mom shaking me awake telling me my parents were there to come get me. \n\nWe had a \"family intervention\" the next day between my family and my boyfriends. They basically just screamed at us about how irresponsible and stupid we were for drinking and we completely clammed up. Because of that we didn't even realize what had happened to us till months later. The stress over our parents anger overrode us actually thinking about what happened to us that night. \n\nI moved out shortly after because I just couldn't trust my parents anymore. \n\nIf this had happened at a younger age I don't know what I'd do. I was a good kid but 1 fuck up was enough for me to be seen as a failure to them.\n\nIf your kid seems off you take care of them and wait till morning to be mad.
