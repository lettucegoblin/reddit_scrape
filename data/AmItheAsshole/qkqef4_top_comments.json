I have a few somewhat disjointed thoughts for you, as someone who also grew up the unfavorite child and is now a happy, fully functioning adult. \n\nOne: it's a dirty little secret that the kid who wasn't the favorite often turns out very well in the end. From an early age, you had to learn how to self-soothe, solve your own problems, be our own motivation and cheerleader, seek out kindness rather than take it for granted, and develop an independent mindset because your parents weren't in your corner. You possess many traits that will give you a great leg up in life, even though your parents aren't one of them. \n\nTwo: I know you may not feel this way now, but it's sometimes liberating to break away from your parents when you are young, rather than stunt your own growth by clinging to hopes that they'll change or doing X will make them love you. You see who they are. You can now choose a college, a job, a place to live, a spouse, an entire future without being bogged down with the false hope of winning their approval or \"earning\" their love (something that should never have to be earned). \n\nThree: I have a thought about why this might be happening, based on my experience. My mother wanted her kids to be exactly like her - introverted, quiet, bookish, intellectual, emotionally flat. I was like my father - social, talkative, creative, and vivid. She couldn't stand me because I wasn't like her. Raising me knowing I wasn't going to be like her felt like such a waste to her. My dad didn't care too much that I was like him. He loved my brother because he was so much like my mother and he loved my mother. They orbited around the kid that was a better reflection of their own love for themselves and each other. I don't know if that's true for you but I want to offer that as food for thought. \n\nFour: your grandparents are heroes. It's a miracle that they are in your corner.

My sister is the one that has always been an absolute pile. She was an awful kid. She all but failed out of high school. She had no ambition past smoking weed and drinking then and she doesn't have any more now. Until this year she has lived with my mother 99% of her life. She has never held a job. As soon as she had my nephew she started doing drugs and left him with me for 2.5 years then was offended when he had no idea who she was when she decided to switch from street drugs to prescription ones and wanted him back. My mom fully believes i cannot take care of my kids and tells everyone that if I ever try to move away she will take my kids from me. I am 30 years old and still have not found the balls to stand up to her about all of it. In fact we are going to move out of state soon and I'm not telling my mom til we are gone so she can't try anything stupid because I know she will make my life a living hell.
