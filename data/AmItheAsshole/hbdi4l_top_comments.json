It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. \n\nA few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent.

The restaurant was purchased by the restaurant chef, and rented the space from the building owner. The building owner renovated the floors above the restaurant and opened a hotel. He decided that he wanted to open a restaurant for the hotel where my boss was currently running his business. So one day the building owner just changes the locks on the doors and tries to force eviction. My chef was really lucky at the time as he knew someone with a space available and was willing to allow my chef to begin renovating to fit his restaurant there immediately the same day the doors were locked so instead of fighting it he just called the police to force the building owner to let him get his things out. Eventually the owner gave my chef a day to go in and get what he owned. The building owner assumed that the chef would be walking out with the supplies, food, dishes, booze and pos system. Little did he know that my chef built the restaurant himself. He built the beautiful bar by hand, he built the bar stools, he did the intricate wood working on the walls, he purchased fancy toilets and he was financing all the kitchen equipment, so all employees and a crew of builders went to the closed restaurant and dismantled it. All that was left was light fixtures and dry wall. The only thing we couldn't reuse was the floor tile but we made sure to smash as many as we could on the way out. The building owner tried to sue for damages but the court laughed him out the door. He ended up recreating down to the letter a famous British establishment, even stealing the name! He lost another court battle over attempting to use a trademark without permission and he eventually shut down the restaurant part of his hotel. The hotel still stands but has just a wine bar, no restaurant at all and nobody in the city will align with the building owner anymore to put one there.",

Long story short: she told me she didn't want the garden (I would've gladly left it behind for free) but expected me to pay her back for her half of the soil. Not happening.

        "body": "I had a landlord do this!! I was barely 20 and was just barely starting to realise that I was abused my entire life, like I knew I was abused but am still learning the extent of it through trauma therapy and memories I don\u2019t want to remember popping up to ruin my day. My mate and I were both on the lease, and she\u2019d had a flat before, so I trusted her as the \u201cadultier-adult.\u201d After a few months she went off of her meds and tried to kill me, so I got out of the lease with a restraining order. The landlord said I was all good and wouldn\u2019t hear from them aside from a check returning my security deposit at the end of the lease, because I\u2019d definitely be getting my half back.\n\nThe next two months the landlord tried to collect the other girl\u2019s missed rent from me when she couldn\u2019t get it from her, going on about how I was on the lease and could still get an eviction on my record if she had to evict the other girl. I just referred her to the lease release agreement she and I had both signed because it protected me from exactly what she was trying to do now. So however many months down the line I get something from them and it\u2019s a bill for double what I was meant to be receiving. The former flatmate had trashed the place... kicked in doors, broken fans, had to be evicted... the list goes on. Basically the damages more than doubled the security deposit itself, quadrupling what my portion was. I reminded the landlord that she\u2019d told me I\u2019d be getting my half back, and she said the conversation never took place. As a verbal conversation, she knew I couldn\u2019t prove it. I directed her to the lease release agreement in which it states that I was not responsible for damages that occurred after I left, and she said it was impossible to tell when what damages occurred. Again, she was right. She\u2019d written the entire agreement to make it sound like I was protected from all of these things, but carefully worded so that there was a loophole at every turn to make it useless. I reminded her that our flat was inspected when I left, and she said it wasn\u2019t a \u201cmove-out inspection\u201d but rather a \u201clease violation inspection\u201d to gather evidence of the flatmate violating the lease. I said she\u2019d have to notice if the place were intentionally trashed at that point, and she said she had no paperwork on the matter so it doesn\u2019t count.\n\nShe thought I was dumb. I may not have had street smarts, but I did have all of the anxiety and trust issues that come from child abuse! So I forwarded her the email I\u2019d originally sent nearly a year prior with all of the time stamped photos of the flat. I didn\u2019t trust the flatmate not to trash the flat so I\u2019d taken my own move out photos that showed the lack of damages. Since I\u2019d sent them to them right after taking them they couldn\u2019t try to suggest the photos were altered. They were all time stamped and the email provided a time stamp. I *could* prove that it was fine when I left, something she forgot somehow. Never bank on people being as dumb as they look",
