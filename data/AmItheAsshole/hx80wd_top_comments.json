You could even have a room titled \"messages to the couple\" where tipsy guests at home in their pjs can go in and ramble their congrats and well wishes to a recorded channel(or a zoom for just that if you prefer video messages).

        "body": "I'd go further and say you're a socially inappropriate AH if you even ask. It's just not about you on that day, period and making it about you even with permission is still inappropriate. Even if the bride and groom don't have strong feelings about it, it isn't their job to ensure that all the guests are there only to celebrate *them.* That's the job of each guest no matter what the bride and groom say. The bride and groom shouldn't ever have to decide whether their own wedding is going to be only about them or not, the guests should be trusted to do that as a gift to the bride and groom no matter what the couple's feelings are. And gift probably isn't the right word bc they're entitled to it. Everyone is there to celebrate them and for no other reason, they deserve that no matter how easy going they may be. \n\nIt's fucking lazy, rude and cheap too, the couple spent God knows how much for that day and hours and hours planning and instead of spending your own money and planning your own party for your own relationship, you ask if you can mooch on the couples money and planning and share their day. The audacity is unreal. The rudeness of something like that goes beyond the kindness and generosity of the bride and groom. The definition of tacky. Have a nice dinner party with both family sets to propose if it's important for them to be there.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d go further and say you&#39;re a socially inappropriate AH if you even ask. It&#39;s just not about you on that day, period and making it about you even with permission is still inappropriate. Even if the bride and groom don&#39;t have strong feelings about it, it isn&#39;t their job to ensure that all the guests are there only to celebrate <em>them.</em> That&#39;s the job of each guest no matter what the bride and groom say. The bride and groom shouldn&#39;t ever have to decide whether their own wedding is going to be only about them or not, the guests should be trusted to do that as a gift to the bride and groom no matter what the couple&#39;s feelings are. And gift probably isn&#39;t the right word bc they&#39;re entitled to it. Everyone is there to celebrate them and for no other reason, they deserve that no matter how easy going they may be. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s fucking lazy, rude and cheap too, the couple spent God knows how much for that day and hours and hours planning and instead of spending your own money and planning your own party for your own relationship, you ask if you can mooch on the couples money and planning and share their day.
