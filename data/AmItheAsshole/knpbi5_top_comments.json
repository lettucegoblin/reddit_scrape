Throwaway, yada yada.\n\nWell, technically we're a few hours away from 2021. So advanced happy new year.\n\nI'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.\n\nFamily from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.\n\nAs is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. \n\nWhile listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. \n\nShe began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. \n\nNow, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. \n\nI don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said \"I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?\" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, \"You guys made your first million yet? Because I have.\" \n\nThe room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.\n\nWas I an asshole?\n\nP.S.

It&#39;s simply easier for the pack to identify one target and hammer that person down because it allows everyone else to ignore the non-ideal aspects in everyone else, but most importantly themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean you can call it culture but that&#39;s literally the definition of narcissistic abuse dynamics. Which is not exclusive to Asians, see <a href=\"/r/raisedbynarcissists\">r/raisedbynarcissists</a>. Just shrugging and saying it&#39;s &quot;culture&quot; is apologetics. How would you feel if you went to some white friend&#39;s house and their parents started saying racist shit at you, and they just said &quot;Sorry, being racist is just a really toxic part of their Southern culture.&quot; As if nothing could even be attempted to fix it.</p>\n</div>",

That \"pride\" isn't healthy; for them it's about getting all the attention they can. They will pretend to be loving parents in front of others but are monsters in private.

I know what wrong behavior looks like and it's hard for me to reconcile that these people aren't jerks/bad parents bc of the way they stood around and bullied OP (or allowed OP to be bullied bc they didn't want to rock the boat).
