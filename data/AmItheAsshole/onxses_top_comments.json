        "body": "NTA. \n\nI manage a team of support agents in cyber security. I am extremely flexible with time off even though the team is small and the workload high because I understand the mental toll the job can take if you get burned out. Getting yelled at for things that aren\u2019t our fault as a company, well outside our scope of service, or just flat out a product issue that dev should have fixed in the first place is draining. Every time I have to take over a call because some moron is yelling at one of my agents it\u2019s never because of something they did wrong.\n\nAll that being said, I need notice if someone won\u2019t be in. I need it to ensure we have coverage and can meet our customers demands and expectations. I will often have to offer up OT to cover at least a portion of a missed shift so that I don\u2019t have an agent stuck working alone having to handle everything on their own, and if no one is available to pick up OT then I will do it myself. It just causes to much stress on everyone when people don\u2019t show up.\n\nAttendance is the absolute bear minimum of the requirements an employer has. All you need to do is show up at the time you agreed and stay until it\u2019s time to leave. Now we all know that sometimes life gets in the way and stuff comes up, but when it does you should be in a position where you have the time built up to use it. Where I run out of tolerance is the people that want to use PTO as soon as they accrue it with no warning. Like they accrue 4 hours of PTO every Friday and guess what? I need to take a half day today!\n\nWe even tried to switch up how PTO was accrued by providing a bulk amount at the start of the year with PTO then accruing at half the speed for the remainder of the year. Within 2 months I had 3 people already out of sick time. Some people just cant manage to ration their time off and it\u2019s almost always for BS excuses (of course sometimes it is valid like having to care for a relative or just plain bad luck with several things happening at once). It\u2019s the same concept as blowing your whole paycheck the day you get it.\n\nAt the end of the day if you can\u2019t be trusted to show up to work, then it\u2019s not the right job for you. Showing up to work shouldn\u2019t be difficult. As I said earlier, it\u2019s the bear minimum of what\u2019s expected of you when you get hired.\n\nSorry, rant over. Been dealing with some inconsistent attendance from my team of late and it is causing a lot of stress on myself and the people that show up to work hard and perform every day. I hate having to do write ups or PIP\u2019s because everyone I hire is an adult that should be able to be trusted to meet the requirements we agreed on at the time of their hire. Having to resort to discipline always feels like when I have to punish one of my children. We both know you are screwing up, so either fix it or go find something that is better suited to your mental fortitude.",

        "body": "As someone who relates to the spoon theory and needing to take the day off, I can say that you're NTA OP. Yes, sometimes work or something is just Too Much, and a mental health day is needed. Sometimes it can cost too many spoons to contact someone, especially of you feel guilty for not being able to do something. \n\nThat being said, if you are in a position where your actions affect someone else, you have to suck it up and do it. If you can't, then you shouldn't be in that position in the first place, so you are right to push for demotion. On taking a job, it is your responsibility to perform that job to the best of your ability. If the best you have is simply not enough to do that job, then you shouldn't have that job.\n\nYou wouldn't give someone with mobility issues a job which requires climbing lots of stairs. It's simply a fact that sometimes someone's health, mental or otherwise, means that they are simply not the best person suited for the task. \n\nUnfortunately when someone is denied a position because of this, it often brings in cries of discrimination. Are you denying a job to someone on the basis of their health and abilities? Technically yes, BUT, as long as you are making all possible REASONABLE compromises, then you aren't in the wrong. \n\nPeople and employers want everyone to succeed. Sometimes this means extra meetings, accountability, set schedules, a special chair, parking spot. Usually, these measures can be small but make a huge difference in someone's ability to do their job. If you were denying someone a position when their ability to do their job could be vastly improved by a compromise like this, then it would possibly be discrimination.\n\nIn this case, there is no reasonable compromise or alternative you as an employer could have made. \n\nIf you had denied the day off and disregarded her need for a mental health day, that would be shitty, but that isn't the problem here. The issue is that she did not call in to arrange an alternative. You had the responsibility to grant the sick day, and she had the responsibility to actually apply for it. \n\nIf she had been open and up front about her health from the outset, and about its potential to affect her position and jobs responsibilities, this could have been avoided. People with spoons can find that the same task costs different energy spoons on different days. Just because calling in sick on the day was too much for her in that moment, she could have talked to you regarding the possibility of a need for a sick day prior to the event. Even in a \"hey, my health isn't 100%, would you be ok with me taking some time when I need it? What provisions would you need to make that happen?\" This gives the employer a heads up, and makes it easier for the employee to actually make the call on the day, as they already have a good idea of what the response to the call is going to be, making it cost less spoons. \n\nIf she cannot guarantee that the same thing will not happen again, then she is not able to hold that position, end of story. In having that contracted job, she is saying that she will be able to do it. If she can't, that's on her. \n\nSometimes it sucks. Sometimes the job you want isn't the one you can physically or mentally have. But that's on the one applying for the job to make sure that the position is within their capabilities.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As someone who relates to the spoon theory and needing to take the day off, I can say that you&#39;re NTA OP. Yes, sometimes work or something is just Too Much, and a mental health day is needed. Sometimes it can cost too many spoons to contact someone, especially of you feel guilty for not being able to do something. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, if you are in a position where your actions affect someone else, you have to suck it up and do it. If you can&#39;t, then you shouldn&#39;t be in that position in the first place, so you are right to push for demotion. On taking a job, it is your responsibility to perform that job to the best of your ability. If the best you have is simply not enough to do that job, then you shouldn&#39;t have that job.</p>\n\n<p>You wouldn&#39;t give someone with mobility issues a job which requires climbing lots of stairs. It&#39;s simply a fact that sometimes someone&#39;s health, mental or otherwise, means that they are simply not the best person suited for the task. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately when someone is denied a position because of this, it often brings in cries of discrimination. Are you denying a job to someone on the basis of their health and abilities? Technically yes, BUT, as long as you are making all possible REASONABLE compromises, then you aren&#39;t in the wrong. </p>\n\n<p>People and employers want everyone to succeed. Sometimes this means extra meetings, accountability, set schedules, a special chair, parking spot. Usually, these measures can be small but make a huge difference in someone&#39;s ability to do their job. If you were denying someone a position when their ability to do their job could be vastly improved by a compromise like this, then it would possibly be discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, there is no reasonable compromise or alternative you as an employer could have made. </p>\n\n<p>If you had denied the day off and disregarded her need for a mental health day, that would be shitty, but that isn&#39;t the problem here. The issue is that she did not call in to arrange an alternative. You had the responsibility to grant the sick day, and she had the responsibility to actually apply for it. </p>\n\n<p>If she had been open and up front about her health from the outset, and about its potential to affect her position and jobs responsibilities, this could have been avoided. People with spoons can find that the same task costs different energy spoons on different days. Just because calling in sick on the day was too much for her in that moment, she could have talked to you regarding the possibility of a need for a sick day prior to the event. Even in a &quot;hey, my health isn&#39;t 100%, would you be ok with me taking some time when I need it? What provisions would you need to make that happen?&quot; This gives the employer a heads up, and makes it easier for the employee to actually make the call on the day, as they already have a good idea of what the response to the call is going to be, making it cost less spoons. </p>\n\n<p>If she cannot guarantee that the same thing will not happen again, then she is not able to hold that position, end of story. In having that contracted job, she is saying that she will be able to do it. If she can&#39;t, that&#39;s on her. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it sucks. Sometimes the job you want isn&#39;t the one you can physically or mentally have. But that&#39;s on the one applying for the job to make sure that the position is within their capabilities.</p>\n</div>",

But with that said Im aware of this problem that I have so I wouldnt at all blame someone for demoting me because If I cant make a phone call I clearly am not someone who should be responsible for a business.</p>\n</div>",

I mean, a cashier not showing up is not good either, but the company doesn't really get affected as much as a manager who has to open the store not showing up.

You may have wanted to show your appreciation for her work, and if presented in a certain way, she might have felt obligated to accept. And now she's miserable. Maybe there's a way to give her a raise for doing a great job, without changing her position? \n\n\nI am a SAHM and with 6 kids am busy as hell all day. I do some freelance work whenever I have time.

My supervisor did the accommodations verbally, but when he left and was replaced there was no paperwork in my file about accommodations.  The new guy said I needed a doctor's note and to go through HR per company policy.  Until I could get that done I could take unpaid FMLA or work without accommodations.   It is the employer's right to have medical verification that accommodations are needed.  \n\nI spoke to a lawyer before filing my ADA with this employer because I wasn't so sure that they needed my diagnosis as their paperwork requested.   The lawyer basically said you are asking them to accommodate a chemo pump.  They will figure out it is cancer on their own.  He recommended being totally honest because as big as my district is they probably have a template for cancer patients just not those with chemo pumps.  He said the template may have accommodations i hadn't thought of yet but might need.\n\nHe was right.  I didn't realize that I needed an accommodation about last minute paperwork requests, but it was in there.  At the end of the year, the district wanted this huge report written up before we left for the end of the year, but didn't tell anyone until 48 hours before we left for summer.  Due to my accommodation that I needed two weeks notice, I did not have to complete this report.",
