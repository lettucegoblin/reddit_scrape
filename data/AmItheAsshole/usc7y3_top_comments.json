I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home. \n\nRecently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office.\n\n\nLast week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually. \n\nI got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was stuck for 6 years.\n\nI'm coming up on my 3rd marriage soon, and it's the best relationship I've ever had, because I learned from my mistakes and worked to become a better person. **DO NOT ACCEPT PEOPLE TREATING YOU THE WAY YOUR WIFE CURRENTLY DOES.** You're in an abusive situation, and you don't realize it likely because \"men can't be abused\". Yes, yes we can, no matter how much bigger you are than the woman you're in a relationship with.

Do you think you'd have gotten a warning for his behavior? Or do you think the cops would be called on him while your coworkers rally around you with sympathy? How many people would be telling you to leave the marriage because your abusive partner will obviously escalate, as they do?\n\nFriend. You are being abused. Get out of this marriage now before you spend years forgetting who you were before being abused, stuck in a deep depression that ruins you both mentally and physically. Yes, stress from relationships like yours can absolutely cause physical pain. I had 5 years of chronic back pain, and no doctor could determine the cause. Then I get out of the relationship and the constant pain just...stopped.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk further about this, because I'm an open book and if I can help someone else not suffer like I have, I'm going to do it.",

She needs anger management therapy at a bare fucking minimum and honestly, with the level of escalation that she&#39;s demonstrated already, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth you being around to see how she does with that.  </p>\n\n<p>Get out before you get fired, hurt or worse.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "OP please listen to what this commenter said.  You ARE in an abusive relationship.  It's not at all unusual that you're unaware of this, it's incredibly difficult to diagnose an emotionally abusive relationship while you are in it\n\n\nWhen you try to make sense of the way your wife acts, you apply your own motives and mindset to her actions.  It helps you deny the truth of what is really happening and it's 100% normal to do as a human trying to empathize. \n\nYou wouldn't ever embarrass her at work on purpose to try to force her to do what you want.  So you tell yourself, \"She was just SO upset she couldn't control herself.\"  You wouldn't scream in her face and call her names for forgetting a chore, so you tell yourself, \"She is just too stressed and I really shouldn't have forgotten, if I do it now and apologize everything will go back to normal.\"\n\nYour wife has a different mindset and motives than you do.  She feels entitled to be in control, of the big and small decisions, about what you do and don't do, she handles her anxiety and insecurities by forcing YOU to change how you live in the world (because it can't possibly be that she needs to change).\n\nShe is at WAR with you for the power and control.  She manipulates and harms you to get what she wants.  She PURPOSELY causes you harm for her own benefit.  She came to your work TO embarrass you,  maybe even force you out of that job, because the more independent you are the less control she has over you.  \n\nShe KNOWS what she did was wrong and she is using a classic abuser manipulation, she violates a boundary (by coming to your work to yell at you and risking your job) and then she blames YOU for the reaction to her boundary violation.  She acts as if the reaction came out of the clear blue sky and she was the victim of it. \n\nYou're probably thinking right now, \"This person doesn't know her like I do, doesn't know all of the good things about her and how much we love each other and how wonderful she is when she's not mad.\"  \n\nI DO know her, I KNOW that the \"good times\" are a requirement for an abusive relationship to function. The \"good times\" in an abusive relationship are often every bit as good as the bad times are bad.  There's actually a term for it \"love bombing\" and it happens early on in the relationship to get you to commit and then after big blow ups when she is afraid you might leave.  It's the carrot on the stick, the false hope that \"If only you can be or do whatever she wants the good times will return forever and the abuse will stop.\"\n\nThe ONLY way to stop the abuse is to leave her.  There is NOTHING about who or how you are that causes her to treat you this way.  The abuse is a CHOICE she makes for her own benefit.  She will ALWAYS find some \"reason\" to blow up at you. \n\nYou are stuck in a cycle,  it goes from abusive episode>honeymoon period/love bombing> tension building>abusive episode.  As you know, the abuses start small and then slowly escalate over time.  This allows you to acclimate to greater and greater mistreatment.  You're the frog in boiling water. \n\nAsk yourself, if 1 week into dating she had showed up at your work and done this... would you have kept seeing her?  No,  she had to start small and slowly degrade your sense of the way you deserve to be treated, your perspective of how someone who loves you should act. \n\nThat's part of why she wants you isolated from friends and family.  She needs to control your perspective and she doesn't want you to figure out that you deserve kindness and respect, even when your partner is upset.\n\nPlease, please reach out to someone you trust and tell them what is happening.  Abuse thrives in secrecy and you deserve support. None of the shame is yours and you do not owe her protection from the truth. \n\nPart of why it's hard to tell someone is that we often feel ashamed at what we've accepted and we know that if we tell someone that it can be the beginning of the end.  The abuse is designed to cause the same brainwashing as Stockholm Syndrome (called the trauma bond in abuse).\n\nYour lizard brain has been hacked to believe and respond to her as if her happiness and approval is the key to your literal survival.  Your brain releases chemical reactions to promote appeasing her.  That's part of why what you rationally understand (I don't deserve to be treated this way and it's getting worse) doesn't seem to square up with how you feel (I hope she's OK I love her and will do anything to fix this).\n\nYou need time away from her, no contact and talking to someone about the truth. I know it's hard, I had to do it once myself and it was the best, hardest, and most important decision I have made in my life. \n\nLife doesn't HAVE to be this hard, she is creating the chaos.  You deserve kindness and respect, a partner who WANTS to understand your needs so they can meet them.  The \"good times\" do NOT make up for the abuse and the more commited you are the more her abuse will escalate.  Whatever you do, do NOT create a child with her, that would just trap you further and mess up a child for life. \n\nPlease reach out to someone.  Your employer may be able to help as well\nI'm really proud of you for posting here. You have NOTHING to be ashamed of.  Her abuse does NOT make your love less real.  You deserve to have your live returned instead of weaponized against you. \n\nReach out if you ever need to talk.  I'm so sorry this is happening to you.  I wish you all the best.",

Whatever you do, do NOT create a child with her, that would just trap you further and mess up a child for life. </p>\n\n<p>Please reach out to someone.  Your employer may be able to help as well\nI&#39;m really proud of you for posting here. You have NOTHING to be ashamed of.  Her abuse does NOT make your love less real.  You deserve to have your live returned instead of weaponized against you. </p>\n\n<p>Reach out if you ever need to talk.  I&#39;m so sorry this is happening to you.  I wish you all the best.</p>\n</div>",
