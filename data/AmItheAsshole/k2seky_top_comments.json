Whether you choose to believe the OP here that he had her delete and didn&#39;t show the presentation to the cousin, or whether you believe that the inverse is true according to a post that appeared shortly after this was #1 in one of most popular subreddits is your prerogative.</p>\n\n<p>For fairness, the other post in question so you can make your own judgment(s): <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/k82xg6/my_daughter_15f_was_shown_a_hurtful_video_made_by/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/k82xg6/my_daughter_15f_was_shown_a_hurtful_video_made_by/</a></p>\n</div>",

It seems like your wife is trying to establish a healthy foundation for future family events because maybe the daughters WILL like each other as they mature. \n\nSimply based on your actions, you don\u2019t support your wife after enabling her desire for their friendship for 16 years, then encourage your daughter for being mean and cruel. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a good reason to be so mean. She doesn\u2019t like the sound of her voice? Why is that grounds for being mean to your COUSIN? \n\nAlso, you\u2019re a grown man and you are laughing at a ppt bullying a 16 y/o girl? \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to not force your daughter to be in situations that she would be uncomfortable (i.e spending the night at the cousins house, going on trips without you and your wife, etc.), but to support your wife\u2019s initiative for a friendship between family? A zoom call? Bringing the cousin along to outings? None of this seems like your wife is asking too much of either of you. \n\nMaybe my opinion is a bit biased because I (F) grew up with girl cousins that were super close in age. Our parents wanted us to be nice to each other (at the very least), but now that we are all adults, we have children and we enjoy each other\u2019s presences more than we did at 16 y/o. We\u2019re nice to each other and, even more so, it\u2019s nice that we can all be together as a family. Our personalities are not the same and my cousins are their own people, but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t all friends to each other. \n\nI think your wife has pure intentions and is trying to do something nice for them.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see this response enough on here, but I say:</p>\n\n<p>YTA.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure how your wife wanting her kid to be nice and have a friendship with her cousin makes your wife the asshole, but family is not the same as the neighbors kid or your friend\u2019s kid. It seems like your wife is trying to establish a healthy foundation for future family events because maybe the daughters WILL like each other as they mature. </p>\n\n<p>Simply based on your actions, you don\u2019t support your wife after enabling her desire for their friendship for 16 years, then encourage your daughter for being mean and cruel. </p>\n\n<p>It sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a good reason to be so mean. She doesn\u2019t like the sound of her voice? Why is that grounds for being mean to your COUSIN? </p>\n\n<p>Also, you\u2019re a grown man and you are laughing at a ppt bullying a 16 y/o girl? </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to not force your daughter to be in situations that she would be uncomfortable (i.e spending the night at the cousins house, going on trips without you and your wife, etc.), but to support your wife\u2019s initiative for a friendship between family? A zoom call? Bringing the cousin along to outings? None of this seems like your wife is asking too much of either of you. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe my opinion is a bit biased because I (F) grew up with girl cousins that were super close in age. Our parents wanted us to be nice to each other (at the very least), but now that we are all adults, we have children and we enjoy each other\u2019s presences more than we did at 16 y/o. We\u2019re nice to each other and, even more so, it\u2019s nice that we can all be together as a family. Our personalities are not the same and my cousins are their own people, but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t all friends to each other. </p>\n\n<p>I think your wife has pure intentions and is trying to do something nice for them.</p>\n</div>",

There&#39;s no way she hasn&#39;t displayed that kind of behavior before, but you were just too busy being the &quot;cool dad&quot; to notice or even care.</p>\n\n<p>So you need to put your big boy pants on and be a real father, by making it clear that what she did (and particularly the cruelty she displayed in the way she did it) absolutely will not be tolerated.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s been clearly stated why the wife was in the wrong so I won&#39;t repeat the obvious, but wow it is really distressing to see how many people condone an adult laughing at a cruel attack of a teenager even if she never saw it. It&#39;s not surprising for two young sisters to laugh at a peer that annoys them, but you&#39;re a grown man and their dad that is encouraging what at best would be a very low blow, out of frustration, and at worst bullying. From what you&#39;ve stated it sounds like the cousin hasn&#39;t even done anything wrong to deserve such a meticulously cruel character assassination.

        "body": "If this actually happened: I understand that this Powerpoint-mainly directed at the wife-was done from a place of frustration. That level of harshness may have seemed like the only way of getting through to your wife. However, gathering everyone to read a list of reasons might have been well-received. Your daughter seems like a bully and it's possible you don't see it just because she acts more like a \"smart misfit\" type than Regina George. Guess what? Still mean. Especially considering she took the time to record her cousin's voice and the cousin's worst flaw is being \"annoying\". You yourself admit that in hindsight, you realized how cruel this was. You also even use the word \"mocking\" in the title of your post, which means a part of you acknowledges that it was mean. I'm going to be optimistic and hope it wasn't because you wanted more views. Still, she is just a teenager, and she can be held accountable for her actions while we acknowledge that it was the responsibility of you and your wife to have not let it get to this point. It would be less understandable if an adult did this. But one day, your daughter will be an adult and she needs to learn this is not okay.\n\nI repeat: Whether intervention entails you stopping your wife early on from forcing your daughter to hang out with someone she's just not compatible with (not because it's your duty \"as a man\", but because if someone is being manipulative or controlling, it is worth not being passive), teaching your daughter not to be so judgmental of little things in such a way that it manifests in her ripping them apart behind their back or otherwise (while still taking a stance and validating that she doesn't have to hang out with someone she doesn't want to), or whatever you do next to handle this situation to rectify it, you had/have a choice. This is all part of being a parent, and it is worth doing it. Not just the parts you want. All of it. You are not a passive audience member in your own life. You had autonomy here.\n\nI say this because others have picked up on the fact that you are proud of being the favorite parent. That undoubtedly influences how you treat your daughter and how she perceives your wife. In my line of work, I see many parents (especially in cases of divorce) take the role of the \"fun parent\" which basically means the parent who lets the kid do whatever they want. In this case, it could mean getting away with being mean. By contrast, the other parent in the scenario may be more responsible and have to do all of the actual parenting by default. They are seen as \"bad\", especially if the kid sees no problem with this and likes instant gratification, as many kids do. Sometimes this is due to the \"fun parent\" having been raised by a super strict parent and not wanting to be like that, but mostly, it seems to come from a place of wanting approval and validation (or trying to win over the child...if that's the case, I would ask yourself why you feel you're in competition with your wife). It seems like you want your daughter's approval so much that it may be stunting parts of her social development. While it is okay for couples to have different parenting styles or disagree, you and your wife seem to be at opposite extremes in terms of parenting her as a whole. If you do nothing, you might be letting your desire for approval get in the way of a teachable moment. I know this was something that it was hard for you not to laugh at because it was so out of left field, but it's what you do next could set things right.\n\nFor these reasons and the others listed: ***ESH***\n\nI hope you're reading the comments that disagree with your opinion (by posting this here, I would hope you would be willing to hear them) as well as the ones that agree. And also I hope you're realizing that some of the people who are saying you aren't responsible at all make a note that their verdict is true \"if\" you talk to her about it.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If this actually happened: I understand that this Powerpoint-mainly directed at the wife-was done from a place of frustration. That level of harshness may have seemed like the only way of getting through to your wife. However, gathering everyone to read a list of reasons might have been well-received. Your daughter seems like a bully and it&#39;s possible you don&#39;t see it just because she acts more like a &quot;smart misfit&quot; type than Regina George. Guess what? Still mean. Especially considering she took the time to record her cousin&#39;s voice and the cousin&#39;s worst flaw is being &quot;annoying&quot;. You yourself admit that in hindsight, you realized how cruel this was. You also even use the word &quot;mocking&quot; in the title of your post, which means a part of you acknowledges that it was mean. I&#39;m going to be optimistic and hope it wasn&#39;t because you wanted more views. Still, she is just a teenager, and she can be held accountable for her actions while we acknowledge that it was the responsibility of you and your wife to have not let it get to this point. It would be less understandable if an adult did this. But one day, your daughter will be an adult and she needs to learn this is not okay.</p>\n\n<p>I repeat: Whether intervention entails you stopping your wife early on from forcing your daughter to hang out with someone she&#39;s just not compatible with (not because it&#39;s your duty &quot;as a man&quot;, but because if someone is being manipulative or controlling, it is worth not being passive), teaching your daughter not to be so judgmental of little things in such a way that it manifests in her ripping them apart behind their back or otherwise (while still taking a stance and validating that she doesn&#39;t have to hang out with someone she doesn&#39;t want to), or whatever you do next to handle this situation to rectify it, you had/have a choice. This is all part of being a parent, and it is worth doing it. Not just the parts you want. All of it. You are not a passive audience member in your own life. You had autonomy here.</p>\n\n<p>I say this because others have picked up on the fact that you are proud of being the favorite parent. That undoubtedly influences how you treat your daughter and how she perceives your wife. In my line of work, I see many parents (especially in cases of divorce) take the role of the &quot;fun parent&quot; which basically means the parent who lets the kid do whatever they want. In this case, it could mean getting away with being mean. By contrast, the other parent in the scenario may be more responsible and have to do all of the actual parenting by default. They are seen as &quot;bad&quot;, especially if the kid sees no problem with this and likes instant gratification, as many kids do. Sometimes this is due to the &quot;fun parent&quot; having been raised by a super strict parent and not wanting to be like that, but mostly, it seems to come from a place of wanting approval and validation (or trying to win over the child...if that&#39;s the case, I would ask yourself why you feel you&#39;re in competition with your wife). It seems like you want your daughter&#39;s approval so much that it may be stunting parts of her social development. While it is okay for couples to have different parenting styles or disagree, you and your wife seem to be at opposite extremes in terms of parenting her as a whole. If you do nothing, you might be letting your desire for approval get in the way of a teachable moment. I know this was something that it was hard for you not to laugh at because it was so out of left field, but it&#39;s what you do next could set things right.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons and the others listed: <strong><em>ESH</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I hope you&#39;re reading the comments that disagree with your opinion (by posting this here, I would hope you would be willing to hear them) as well as the ones that agree. And also I hope you&#39;re realizing that some of the people who are saying you aren&#39;t responsible at all make a note that their verdict is true &quot;if&quot; you talk to her about it.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "THANK YOU. This is a very mature way to handle it. She shouldn't have to hang out with people she doesn't want to hang out with, but the response (if it actually even happened) was disproportionate. And yet, I don't want to deny that she felt like she had to act that way to get through to her mother, who is pushing it. Both can be true: The mom was being inconsiderate of her daughter's wishes AND the daughter was rude to her cousin. AND the husband should be careful about laughing. I know he said he felt bad about it, but he still did it in the moment.\n\nAs an autistic person, I was treated like things that people could consider mildly annoying were death sentences and people would just be rude to me over everything. I was surprised to learn how forgiving the world actually was. Part of me wonders if the cousin has undiagnosed autism just because asking a lot of questions is a sign sometimes and because of the similar treatment (though I can't conclude from this of course). Regardless, I see a lot of people saying that since it's not to the cousin's face, it's fine. Saying mean things behind someone's back is still hurtful, especially when they think you like them. It's natural to not want to hang out with someone, and even though there are reasons I wish people wouldn't choose, they still shouldn't be put in a situation in which they are unhappy/making others unhappy; if that's the only option, they are better off not being friends anyway.\n\nI like the part about how you said making them be friends isn't fair to either of them, because it's not only not fair to the daughter, but the cousin is also suffering from the fact that the daughter is put in the position. She deserves better, especially if her only crime is being \"annoying\" (and again, we don't even know the underlying reason for that). Some of the comments that say \"She isn't saying it to her face so it's fine\" kind of seem to assume that she is nice to this girl. I don't buy it. If she's angry enough to make a Powerpoint about it when she finally loses her cool, chances are she may also have been overly sarcastic/flat out rude to the cousin's face. The cousin may not have picked up on it because she does not suspect it. Or maybe part of her does, but she doesn't know how to say anything because if other people have the same conclusions, this may be her only friend and it's better than nothing.\n\nIt is natural to judge (for better or worse), but it is not natural to make a Powerpoint that takes so much effort to put together in order to make fun of someone. She had several chances to back track and think \"Maybe I should express myself another way instead, like maybe just giving a list of actually valid reasons to my parents, Maybe I shouldn't take the time out of my day to edit a video of a noise she makes and compare it to music theory\", but she never did. And a chain of events led up to this due to the handling of this disagreement between OP and his wife. ESH.",

I was surprised to learn how forgiving the world actually was. Part of me wonders if the cousin has undiagnosed autism just because asking a lot of questions is a sign sometimes and because of the similar treatment (though I can&#39;t conclude from this of course). Regardless, I see a lot of people saying that since it&#39;s not to the cousin&#39;s face, it&#39;s fine. Saying mean things behind someone&#39;s back is still hurtful, especially when they think you like them. It&#39;s natural to not want to hang out with someone, and even though there are reasons I wish people wouldn&#39;t choose, they still shouldn&#39;t be put in a situation in which they are unhappy/making others unhappy; if that&#39;s the only option, they are better off not being friends anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I like the part about how you said making them be friends isn&#39;t fair to either of them, because it&#39;s not only not fair to the daughter, but the cousin is also suffering from the fact that the daughter is put in the position. She deserves better, especially if her only crime is being &quot;annoying&quot; (and again, we don&#39;t even know the underlying reason for that). Some of the comments that say &quot;She isn&#39;t saying it to her face so it&#39;s fine&quot; kind of seem to assume that she is nice to this girl. I don&#39;t buy it. If she&#39;s angry enough to make a Powerpoint about it when she finally loses her cool, chances are she may also have been overly sarcastic/flat out rude to the cousin&#39;s face. The cousin may not have picked up on it because she does not suspect it. Or maybe part of her does, but she doesn&#39;t know how to say anything because if other people have the same conclusions, this may be her only friend and it&#39;s better than nothing.</p>\n\n<p>It is natural to judge (for better or worse), but it is not natural to make a Powerpoint that takes so much effort to put together in order to make fun of someone. She had several chances to back track and think &quot;Maybe I should express myself another way instead, like maybe just giving a list of actually valid reasons to my parents, Maybe I shouldn&#39;t take the time out of my day to edit a video of a noise she makes and compare it to music theory&quot;, but she never did. And a chain of events led up to this due to the handling of this disagreement between OP and his wife. ESH.</p>\n</div>",

It's like your wife's trying to train your daughter to be preyed upon. Your wife is the largest AH, constantly telling her daughter that her feelings are invalid and she's not allowed to have a voice.\n\nAlso, I really, really have an issue with parents forcing their children to spend time with someone they specifically express dislike for. I know people forced to spend time with their rapists \"because they're family!\" This is obviously a *very* different case but the same principles do apply.
