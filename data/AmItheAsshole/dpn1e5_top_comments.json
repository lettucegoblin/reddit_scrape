Your sister is acting like X college and being pretty are the most important markers for achievement. You can totally take her down a peg whenever she brings it up without having to be as upfront as you were (although I personally think you were justified)Her: You should pick Amy to be one of the bridesmaids, she's so pretty!You: Oh, they're basing the bridal party on who they are the closest to, not vanity\n\nHer: Amy should get a pass for X because she graduated from X collegeYou: I'm proud of everyone's accomplishments - especially \\[whoever is the lawyer esp if it's not your kid\\] for passing the bar at such a young age. I think that really gives our family a special shine!\n\nHer: Amy blah blahYou: I'm glad my children are respectful enough to not smoke week at grandmas / \\[whatever else\\]\n\nHer: blah blah about the wedding\n\nYou: I'm so glad that the entire family is willing to let X and X be the stars on their special day.\n\nHer: blah blahYou: It's such a shame that Amy has to work such long hours, I can't believe she would forget grandma's birthday \\[whatever is is that she's messed up\\]. It must really be getting to her, I feel bad for her.\n\nLook, she's created this narrative that being pretty and graduating from X are better than the rest of it. You're buying into this. Are you SURE she's so far ahead of the other children? Being an accountant and a lawyer is no joke. Your son finding love is arguably more important than ANY work accomplishment. Going to 'top' schools is nice and all but it's largely a crapfest on who gets in and how smart they are. I say this as someone who went to a top school.If nothing else, emphasize your children's generosity / charity work / whatever it is they have that Amy doesn't.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA, but can I offer some advice?</p>\n\n<p>You need to learn how to subtly move the goalposts. Your sister is acting like X college and being pretty are the most important markers for achievement. You can totally take her down a peg whenever she brings it up without having to be as upfront as you were (although I personally think you were justified)Her: You should pick Amy to be one of the bridesmaids, she&#39;s so pretty!You: Oh, they&#39;re basing the bridal party on who they are the closest to, not vanity</p>\n\n<p>Her: Amy should get a pass for X because she graduated from X collegeYou: I&#39;m proud of everyone&#39;s accomplishments - especially [whoever is the lawyer esp if it&#39;s not your kid] for passing the bar at such a young age. I think that really gives our family a special shine!</p>\n\n<p>Her: Amy blah blahYou: I&#39;m glad my children are respectful enough to not smoke week at grandmas / [whatever else]</p>\n\n<p>Her: blah blah about the wedding</p>\n\n<p>You: I&#39;m so glad that the entire family is willing to let X and X be the stars on their special day.</p>\n\n<p>Her: blah blahYou: It&#39;s such a shame that Amy has to work such long hours, I can&#39;t believe she would forget grandma&#39;s birthday [whatever is is that she&#39;s messed up]. It must really be getting to her, I feel bad for her.</p>\n\n<p>Look, she&#39;s created this narrative that being pretty and graduating from X are better than the rest of it. You&#39;re buying into this. Are you SURE she&#39;s so far ahead of the other children? Being an accountant and a lawyer is no joke. Your son finding love is arguably more important than ANY work accomplishment. Going to &#39;top&#39; schools is nice and all but it&#39;s largely a crapfest on who gets in and how smart they are. I say this as someone who went to a top school.If nothing else, emphasize your children&#39;s generosity / charity work / whatever it is they have that Amy doesn&#39;t. Make it sound as if that IS more important to you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Or just say, &quot;Dude she graduated months ago, don&#39;t forget we have other people to celebrate here.&quot;<br/>\nOr &quot;Wow you sure like to brag about your daughter!

They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. \n\nMy sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.\n\nI don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. \n\nWhen Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. \n\nAmy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back.

My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. \n\nI was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. \n\nUnfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. \n\nAmy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "While I might agree with your armchair analysis in general, I don\u2019t think it fits this case at all. OP starts out by telling us that occupations among her nieces and nephews run from hairdresser to attorney and that as long as everyone is happy with their careers, more power to them. OP also tells us that Amy is very pretty, and that she graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry. Unless these folks are related to Felicity Huffman or Lori What\u2019s-Her-Name, Amy is extremely intelligent, hard-working, and well-rounded. Note that OP tells us these very positive things about Amy without a hint of jealousy, sarcasm, or a sense that Amy didn\u2019t earn or deserve her not-unimpressive achievements.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that Paula has played up her daughter\u2019s successes \u2018beyond what is true\u2019 creating a \u2018cognitive dissonance\u2019 for Amy, causing her to \u2018lie, cheat, and steal.\u2019 OP makes *no* mention of nefarious goings-on whatsoever. I think that Paula has raised Amy to believe that her very *real* attributes (good looks, intelligence, work ethic) entitle her to privileges which have nothing to do with those qualities. Amy\u2019s attractiveness might get her a modeling job, not a starring role at a cousin\u2019s wedding. A STEM degree from an elite university entitles her to a prestigious, well-paying job; it does not give her permission to rock the ganj\u2019 at Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s. Additionally, unless the Devil\u2019s Lettuce is legal in their state, Amy should be careful; even if it is, they can test for levels and her employer most likely has a standard acceptable maximum.\n\nI\u2019m kind of surprised that Amy still exhibits this kind of behavior. Most teens who have had the experience of always being in the top 5-10 in their high school class; got all of the honors, awards, and scholarships; got perfect or near-perfect SAT scores- IOW, were big fish in very small ponds- get to their prestigious universities only to find that their classmates are *just* as good as (and mostly better than) they are. It is one of those record-scratch, *WTF just happened?,* humbling experiences which tend to re-set one\u2019s attitude (I know this from experience, since it happened to my son and many of his friends). I don\u2019t think Amy\u2019s actions and reactions are fear-driven; that she is insecure deep down; nor that she has had to lie, cheat or steal in order to *appear* to live up to her mother\u2019s claims. I think Paula has convinced her that those things matter in *every* aspect of her life when they clearly don\u2019t.\n\nOne parting thought to the OP... when my son got engaged, I was given a friendly warning by my friend who had experience as the MOG (Mother Of The Groom) x 2. I heeded all of her advice, and the wedding planning (and my relationship with my now-DIL) was stress-free and amazing! I was told to not take this personally, but... BUTT OUT! Don\u2019t offer advice/an opinion unless specifically asked. Wait until all of the other dresses are bought, then match yours to the MOB\u2019s- same length, same level of formality, color that coordinates with hers (and the wedding colors, of course) and does not clash. Keep your guest list as small as possible (your family will all be there anyway, husband and I invited six friends, four of whom came). DO NOT crash any of the festivities/events that you haven\u2019t specifically and wholeheartedly been invited to. Note- I said \u2018wholeheartedly\u2019 on purpose... my son\u2019s wedding took place on New Year\u2019s Eve, close to a weekend, so lots of people were off from work and school. The reception was held at a hotel, and they\u2019d reserved the Bridal Suite for several days surrounding the event. After the rehearsal dinner the night before, most of the bridal party (and others) went out for drinks; then, even though they all had their own rooms at the hotel, the Bride and her Maids had a slumber party in the Bridal Suite. In the morning they got massages, hair, and makeup done there, too. They were joined by MOB, her mom, the Flower Girl, and a few Aunties. The Bride offered to let me, my mom and sister (the mother of the Flower Girl), or just me, get hair and makeup done there as well- \u201c... it\u2019s totally up to you... it\u2019s gonna be pretty noisy and I know how noise gives you a headache, so there\u2019s this one hallway off to the side that\u2019s pretty quiet, you *might* be OK there... but... don\u2019t feel like you have to... totally up to you...\u201d Oh, and her mom offered for my husband and I to ride in one of the limos they got to take family from the hotel to the church. Not sure if I\u2019m conveying this well enough but the hesitations and the tone of her voice made it pretty clear that she was only inviting me to be polite. This was confirmed when I told her that, by coincidence, the place I get my hair and makeup done for occasions was practically across the street from the church and that my plan was to get gussied up, walk over to the church where my husband was waiting with our fancy clothes, get dressed, then hang out with my son for a while. And that\u2019s exactly what I did... in retrospect, I\u2019m SO glad, too! Most of the Groomsmen were \u2018kids\u2019 my son had known most of his life so no one felt weird about me being there. *I* felt slightly weird cuz the temptation was for me to, like, help him with his tie or boutonni\u00e8re or something but there was a photographer there who wanted pics of the Groomsmen doing that... but I did get to hang with my son during that exciting time! I also put myself in my now-DIL\u2019s shoes. When I got married, as much as I liked and loved my MIL, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to be there to help me get dressed (this was a *long* time ago- we didn\u2019t even have a photographer and \u2018getting dressed pics\u2019). It was my mom, grandmoms, and bridesmaids (except his sister, who got ready with their parents). So. My feelings weren\u2019t hurt- I\u2019d have done the same thing. \n\nHoly crap, this got long. If anyone got this far- first, NTA. Second, Paula is barking up the wrong MO__. Although... she shouldn\u2019t be approaching either M. Or her nephew (OP\u2019s son). Or her nephew\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. She should just be butting out and awaiting a Save the Date.\n\nETA thanks for the gold and all of the kind comments! I\u2019m very happy to provide guidance on matters like these. The truth is that I was raised in a dysfunctional family with abusive parents who are in their mid-80\u2019s and *still* don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018boundary.\u2019 I realized early on that if I ever wanted to have children who didn\u2019t end up hating me, I\u2019d better go find out how to be a good parent. I knew exactly what *not* to do, but not what *to* do. My now-DIL was in the same boat. They don\u2019t have kids but she\u2019s been in therapy for a while, learning all the stuff about being a happy adult who has healthy, satisfying relationships- none of which she learned from her own mom and dad. So... shout-out to her, too! I couldn\u2019t have done any of this without her! They got engaged over 4th of July weekend, so after they made the rounds on the 4th to spread the good news, my husband and I spent the next day with them, just hanging out and talking. We were walking around their city neighborhood and she and I had wandered into an urban nursery. While we were browsing, she got serious for a moment and asked me to promise her something- that if, at any point during the wedding planning, she got Zilla-y, with me and/or anyone else, that I\u2019d let her know before things got out of hand. She made me promise to tell her if she was overstepping, hurtling anyone\u2019s feelings, or making anyone mad (especially my mom, who tends to be an asshole). I agreed- on the condition that she do the same for me! \n\nI bought a small olive tree at the nursery that day and told her how perfect it was- that if either of us ever got in a snit or started to feel testy with each other, to snip a piece off of the tree and literally extend an olive branch to the other. Welp. Let\u2019s just say that that tree has lived with me for 6+ years now without getting so much as a twig clipped...",

I think that Paula has raised Amy to believe that her very <em>real</em> attributes (good looks, intelligence, work ethic) entitle her to privileges which have nothing to do with those qualities. Amy\u2019s attractiveness might get her a modeling job, not a starring role at a cousin\u2019s wedding. A STEM degree from an elite university entitles her to a prestigious, well-paying job; it does not give her permission to rock the ganj\u2019 at Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s. Additionally, unless the Devil\u2019s Lettuce is legal in their state, Amy should be careful; even if it is, they can test for levels and her employer most likely has a standard acceptable maximum.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m kind of surprised that Amy still exhibits this kind of behavior. Most teens who have had the experience of always being in the top 5-10 in their high school class; got all of the honors, awards, and scholarships; got perfect or near-perfect SAT scores- IOW, were big fish in very small ponds- get to their prestigious universities only to find that their classmates are <em>just</em> as good as (and mostly better than) they are. It is one of those record-scratch, <em>WTF just happened?,</em> humbling experiences which tend to re-set one\u2019s attitude (I know this from experience, since it happened to my son and many of his friends). I don\u2019t think Amy\u2019s actions and reactions are fear-driven; that she is insecure deep down; nor that she has had to lie, cheat or steal in order to <em>appear</em> to live up to her mother\u2019s claims. I think Paula has convinced her that those things matter in <em>every</em> aspect of her life when they clearly don\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>One parting thought to the OP... when my son got engaged, I was given a friendly warning by my friend who had experience as the MOG (Mother Of The Groom) x 2. I heeded all of her advice, and the wedding planning (and my relationship with my now-DIL) was stress-free and amazing! I was told to not take this personally, but... BUTT OUT! Don\u2019t offer advice/an opinion unless specifically asked. Wait until all of the other dresses are bought, then match yours to the MOB\u2019s- same length, same level of formality, color that coordinates with hers (and the wedding colors, of course) and does not clash. Keep your guest list as small as possible (your family will all be there anyway, husband and I invited six friends, four of whom came). DO NOT crash any of the festivities/events that you haven\u2019t specifically and wholeheartedly been invited to. Note- I said \u2018wholeheartedly\u2019 on purpose... my son\u2019s wedding took place on New Year\u2019s Eve, close to a weekend, so lots of people were off from work and school. The reception was held at a hotel, and they\u2019d reserved the Bridal Suite for several days surrounding the event. After the rehearsal dinner the night before, most of the bridal party (and others) went out for drinks; then, even though they all had their own rooms at the hotel, the Bride and her Maids had a slumber party in the Bridal Suite. In the morning they got massages, hair, and makeup done there, too. They were joined by MOB, her mom, the Flower Girl, and a few Aunties. The Bride offered to let me, my mom and sister (the mother of the Flower Girl), or just me, get hair and makeup done there as well- \u201c... it\u2019s totally up to you... it\u2019s gonna be pretty noisy and I know how noise gives you a headache, so there\u2019s this one hallway off to the side that\u2019s pretty quiet, you <em>might</em> be OK there... but... don\u2019t feel like you have to... totally up to you...\u201d Oh, and her mom offered for my husband and I to ride in one of the limos they got to take family from the hotel to the church. Not sure if I\u2019m conveying this well enough but the hesitations and the tone of her voice made it pretty clear that she was only inviting me to be polite. This was confirmed when I told her that, by coincidence, the place I get my hair and makeup done for occasions was practically across the street from the church and that my plan was to get gussied up, walk over to the church where my husband was waiting with our fancy clothes, get dressed, then hang out with my son for a while. And that\u2019s exactly what I did... in retrospect, I\u2019m SO glad, too! Most of the Groomsmen were \u2018kids\u2019 my son had known most of his life so no one felt weird about me being there. <em>I</em> felt slightly weird cuz the temptation was for me to, like, help him with his tie or boutonni\u00e8re or something but there was a photographer there who wanted pics of the Groomsmen doing that... but I did get to hang with my son during that exciting time! I also put myself in my now-DIL\u2019s shoes. When I got married, as much as I liked and loved my MIL, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to be there to help me get dressed (this was a <em>long</em> time ago- we didn\u2019t even have a photographer and \u2018getting dressed pics\u2019). It was my mom, grandmoms, and bridesmaids (except his sister, who got ready with their parents). So. My feelings weren\u2019t hurt- I\u2019d have done the same thing. </p>\n\n<p>Holy crap, this got long. If anyone got this far- first, NTA. Second, Paula is barking up the wrong MO__. Although... she shouldn\u2019t be approaching either M. Or her nephew (OP\u2019s son). Or her nephew\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. She should just be butting out and awaiting a Save the Date.</p>\n\n<p>ETA thanks for the gold and all of the kind comments! I\u2019m very happy to provide guidance on matters like these. The truth is that I was raised in a dysfunctional family with abusive parents who are in their mid-80\u2019s and <em>still</em> don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018boundary.\u2019 I realized early on that if I ever wanted to have children who didn\u2019t end up hating me, I\u2019d better go find out how to be a good parent. I knew exactly what <em>not</em> to do, but not what <em>to</em> do. My now-DIL was in the same boat. They don\u2019t have kids but she\u2019s been in therapy for a while, learning all the stuff about being a happy adult who has healthy, satisfying relationships- none of which she learned from her own mom and dad. So... shout-out to her, too! I couldn\u2019t have done any of this without her! They got engaged over 4th of July weekend, so after they made the rounds on the 4th to spread the good news, my husband and I spent the next day with them, just hanging out and talking. We were walking around their city neighborhood and she and I had wandered into an urban nursery. While we were browsing, she got serious for a moment and asked me to promise her something- that if, at any point during the wedding planning, she got Zilla-y, with me and/or anyone else, that I\u2019d let her know before things got out of hand. She made me promise to tell her if she was overstepping, hurtling anyone\u2019s feelings, or making anyone mad (especially my mom, who tends to be an asshole). I agreed- on the condition that she do the same for me! </p>\n\n<p>I bought a small olive tree at the nursery that day and told her how perfect it was- that if either of us ever got in a snit or started to feel testy with each other, to snip a piece off of the tree and literally extend an olive branch to the other. Welp. Let\u2019s just say that that tree has lived with me for 6+ years now without getting so much as a twig clipped...</p>\n</div>",

Your family (ideally) are the ones who love you unconditionally and when they call you out for shitty behavior, it\u2019s out of a place of love. They want you to be successful and happy. So many times in our lives, the people around us are \u201cpolite\u201d and usually avoid calling you out on your flaws. They either put up with them or phase you out of their lives, and you may have no idea as to the real reason why. When my bro acts like a whiny emo bitch and can\u2019t figure out why he keeps ending up with trash women, it\u2019s my job, as his big sister, to tell him that it\u2019s because he has no drive to better himself and make himself worth the time of a better woman. A woman who has her shit together isn\u2019t going to have time for a man child who refuses to find better opportunities for himself (even though there are numerous opportunities). And when my mom is acting entitled and faux/offended about something my uncle did/didn\u2019t do, it\u2019s my job to bring her back down to the real world. And when I\u2019m making shitty life decisions, my grandpa steps in and calls me out for it. Because we love each other and want each other to be good and successful people. Somebody should have called Amy and Paula put a long time ago, and maybe this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue.",

So many times in our lives, the people around us are \u201cpolite\u201d and usually avoid calling you out on your flaws. They either put up with them or phase you out of their lives, and you may have no idea as to the real reason why. When my bro acts like a whiny emo bitch and can\u2019t figure out why he keeps ending up with trash women, it\u2019s my job, as his big sister, to tell him that it\u2019s because he has no drive to better himself and make himself worth the time of a better woman. A woman who has her shit together isn\u2019t going to have time for a man child who refuses to find better opportunities for himself (even though there are numerous opportunities). And when my mom is acting entitled and faux/offended about something my uncle did/didn\u2019t do, it\u2019s my job to bring her back down to the real world. And when I\u2019m making shitty life decisions, my grandpa steps in and calls me out for it. Because we love each other and want each other to be good and successful people. Somebody should have called Amy and Paula put a long time ago, and maybe this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Yep sorry but it's very unlikely that Amy is now a better person than the bully she was whenever that photo incident happened. Her behaviour is clearly showing a narcissistic pattern over time which will likely not change. But people's enabling of it can change. And OP's daughter needs possible therapy and at the very least to be  allowed to blossom and grow her confidence, which will not happen while the family is actively encouraging the bully to continue by failing to say anything. OP is totally justified therefore. Amy is nothing but a bully and the rest of the family her enablers for not stepping in and putting a stop to this years ago! NTA.\n\nMy sister did a very similar photo thing to me about 20 years ago. I remember everything about it. It is only the fact that later on years after the photo incident I became popular with men and many people reinforced that I was in fact NOT ugly that some repair to my self esteem occurred. I shudder to think how low I would be now if i hadn't gotten that reinforcement and feedback. I would still be paranoid about my profile view and embarrassed for people to see me up close.\n\nI'll put the story here simply for a crazy/entertaining read for people.\n\nIt was my sister's 17th or 18th or 19thbirthday celebration and a big group of her friends were packed into our living room. I was about 15 at the time. I was always a lot taller than my sister so growing up with her over two years older I caught up to her in size and therefore people would often make the mistake we were twins (this even happened when we were 3 and 5 sometimes) - non-identical twins though. Anyway, photos were being taken in turns as the room was small for the 15 or so people standing around waiting to head out for her birthday celebration elsewhere. Parents want a photo of my sister and I. Sister makes a face but agrees. I get up and go and stand next to her in front of the whole big group. One of her friends says 'you guys really sometimes look like twins you know' I guess because we share some traits. My sister replies in an overly loud voice to make sure her voice drowns out any murmurs or noise: 'there is no way I'm that f$%%ing' ugly!' and laughed her ass off. You'd think maybe one person would tell her off. If not a friend at least my mum or dad, right? Nope. Just an awkward silence where I wanted the earth to swallow me whole. I still can relive that moment now if i want. I remember feeling so hot as I turned beet red, and how I searched the faces of the people there in desperation for someone to step in and correct her and say it's not true. But everyone just avoided eye contact and looked at the floor. Her friends that is. My parents just acted like nothing had happened and continued to smile and call for the next photo. They were used to her berating me and putting me down, and used to sitting there and saying nothing and just letting me become more and more despondent and hopeless as my confidence slid ever lower. \nFor YEARS I cried about that moment and was SURE, absolutely certain that the reason no one said anything was because my sister had been right. They were too embarrassed to lie to my face and reassure me. It was the only thing that made sense to me. So I resigned myself to being ugly and even began to plan for a life of being single and supporting myself and buying a house alone etc. It was so convincing to me that a few years later when a boy I liked my own age told my friend I was 'gorgeous' I was mortified thinking that he was mocking me to my good friend. It was a total impossibility to me that someone could possibly think that when everyone knew I was practically deformed. Well, that is how my mind worked at the time. \n\nSo that is what it's likely poor OP's daughter is going through/went through. I hope to god that the family stood up against Amy at the time. But from this whole post I'm thinking not. I'm thinking everyone stands by looking 'somewhat disapproving' in Amy's direction. Ooooooh, I bet Amy finds that really intimidating....../s.\n\nScrew Amy. She's a narcissist. The family needs to give her an ultimatum on her behaviour. If she cannot respect other people then she cannot participate. It's that simple. She's not even close to a child so what a ridiculous thing for someone to say.",
