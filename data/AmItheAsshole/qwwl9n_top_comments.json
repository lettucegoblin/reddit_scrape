        "body": "Okay so I have a few concerns here, is her only issue that you ate at the KBBQ with a friend and not with her? Does this mean that if you did all the things and went to a different restaurant with your friend, she would've been fine with that? Would she have been fine if you and the friend went to a not-fancy KBBQ? Does her anger come from you two only eating at AYCE KBBQs prior to this? And that this fancy barbeque meal is something you both have been looking forward to?\n\nIf yes, NTA. Because her anger comes from her not experiencing something you both planned to do, a plan that she cancelled on you with to spend time with someone else, on your 30th birthday, no less. Her anger comes from a place of selfishness because *she* didn't get to eat the fancy KBBQ, your friend did. Even though it's her who cancelled on you, she's putting the blame on you, making you question yourself if you were in the wrong. Red flags all around.\n\nIf no, then NTAx3000. Because now her anger comes from where? That you had fun on your birthday without her? That's even more concerning. Because now she's mad you didn't spend your birthday alone. How has your relationship been like before this incident? Has she exhibited controlling and manipulative behaviors like this before? I'd think lomg and hard and recall her behavior with you thus far. \n\nMy concerns are that your wife doesn't seem to care much about you, nor your feelings, and is willing to play victim to manipulate you. My suggestion is to sit with her and talk with her and request for her honesty. Start by telling her you were hurt that she left you on your birthday, and now that she's even angry you celebrated it with your friend, you are even more hurt that she'sputting the blame on you. \n\nThis isn't just about your birthday and the Korean bbq, it's about how she's treating you, the man she's supposed to spend the rest of her life with. You're about to raise a child together, things like these are important if you don't want a child brought up in an emotionally and mentally abusive home. \n\nTry to talk to her. If that doesn't work, seek professional help. Go to couples counseling.\n\nNTA",

Get out of the relationship before it's too late and let her know you'll be insisting on a paternity test. It wasn't just any Birthday, either, it was a milestone. You still managed to have a good time and she resents that. There's something very wrong there. She apologised but insisted it was unavoidable - a lie - then gets in a strop about you having fun? If it was genuinely unavoidable a normal person would have been pleased you still had a great Birthday. There is s much wrong here. Good luck.",

She then made up a reason out of the blue at the last moment to ruin that, but to make it innocent involved a dear old friend, in an scenario that could have been changed but if you, the victim, complains, she could twist things and say that you are the bad one that doesn't contemplate her feelings (in this case, for the friend leaving). If you insist, you are the controlling one. Of course she expected you to be sad and alone, at home, that's the whole point of her scam. This backfired because you still have an ounce of spark for life and had the common sense of inviting a friend out, to celebrate your birthday, as you should. Then she mirrored all she did, trying to control who YOU go out with. ALL NARCISSISTS DO THE SAME. IT ONLY WILL GET WORSE. It will never be a logical conversation between you two, it will be cold and hot, horrible and nice, the rest of your life, if you decide for some strange reason to stay together. No, don't think you should stay because of the child, it's a very unhealthy environment to grow up in. \nPlease find a good lawyer. Sorry about that.",

It's also weird for there to be one specific night where she *has* to see a platonic friend who will be around for weeks after.
