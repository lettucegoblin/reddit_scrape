Getting your approval for something you know little to nothing about seems like a gross misuse of time. Again, had what they did been significant, very different story - but what was done had so little impact financially and on your dog that the fact that you had anything other to say besides &quot;thank you&quot; makes YTA.</p>\n</div>",

He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a \"puppy package\" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\n\nVT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...\n\nMe: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.\n\nVT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.\n\nMe: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\n\n\\*silence\\*\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation!

A few minutes later, she came back...\n\nVT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.\n\nMe: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.\n\nVT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.\n\nMe: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.\n\nVT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.\n\nMe: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?\n\nVT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.\n\nMe: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap.

While they ideally should have checked prior and let you know, it's good that the teeth were removed. The vet might have felt that calling you once he was sedated would prolong the sedation time, which is not usually something we want to do.

Didn't even know it had happened until the dog trainer said one of them wouldn't pick up the bumper. His mouth was hurting because the baby teeth caused an infection. It's worth the $20 to get it done. Yes, you should have been consulted but anesthetized animals aren't out that long because it can cause damage to them to give too much. Taking 5-10 minutes to stop, get your contact info and give you a call may have delayed it too much. If it was something more serious I'd say you were in the right but it was a good move by the vet. I can tell you from experience that very real issues can arise and it gets more expensive the bigger they get because anesthesia is based on weight. Just saying, probably not the hill to die on or to be rude about. YTA but barely.",

My dog also needed this \u2014 the difference though was that <em>i</em> noticed and asked the vet to do it before the neuter... but at 6 months it\u2019s unlikely to fall out on its own. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat if they accidentally pulled out the adult teeth\u201d</p>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>That is impossible. They do not look the same. Adult teeth typically are already all in at 6 months. My pups tooth wasn\u2019t out yet at 5 months and I thought it\u2019d have to be pulled, luckily it fell out just before her spay.

You can visualize both teeth at the same time, and the baby tooth is easy to distinguish from the adult tooth, as it is a fraction of the size. X-rays are not needed to see either tooth. The baby tooth can cause the adult tooth to grow the wrong way and cause an abnormal bite alignment.\n\nAdditionally, the crowding of teeth gives bacteria more of a surfaces and crannies to proliferate in, which can cause plaque and periodontal disease.\n\n[Here](https://www.douglassvillepets.com/uploads/9/8/9/7/98976578/783c93b7-c47b-4530-a363-109ce6588df8_orig.jpg) is a pretty good example of deciduous teeth in dogs. \n\nI'm not necessarily saying what was done by this vet was right or wrong, I'm just informing you of the simplicity of removing deciduous teeth.

You could probably get away with administering it, but you can\u2019t charge someone for it without consent, and clinics can\u2019t afford to do all this stuff for free or for word to get out that they will if you simply say you can\u2019t afford it. This particular clinic is in an area where most owners don\u2019t have a lot of money. Unfortunately from conversations vets can\u2019t do a lot of things due to animals being considered property. There is no law that says an owner can\u2019t *not* euthanize even if they can\u2019t be helped and are suffering. To me that sounds like abuse but that\u2019s the law where she is. \n\nAlso a lot of people don\u2019t sign a waiver bc they can\u2019t afford a lot of things on there.",

I had never had a dog before her. When she was done being groomed, the groomer came out and gave me a stern heart to heart about caring better for her and let me know that matted fur can really make a dog suffer. I could tell she was upset with me that I had let her get that bad, and I realized I was a bad pet owner. After that day, I never let her get matted or go ungroomed again! She is going on 11years and she has lived the life of a princess, as she deserves. I wish I could let that groomer know how well she has been cared for and that I never let her suffer again without proper consistent grooming.",

I totally understand new owners struggling to manage grooming properly, but there's no way the other people didn't notice their dog covered in shit and it breaks my heart every single time.
