DO NOT FALL FOR IT. They do not mean it and will not change. It\u2019s another tactic in manipulation and control. Your heart is going to want to believe him. But you need to watch out for yourself.\n\nOnce he realizes that\u2019s not working, he very well may get mean and start insulting you or sending you cruel texts. DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. His words in that stage are not truths about you, they are just daggers meant to hurt you. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly best to block his number and communicate strictly through lawyers from now on.\n\nAlso: be sure to bring your mom, a brother or a close friend when you go to pick up your stuff. Do not go alone!!! Going alone just gives him an opportunity to manipulate you and draw you back in at a time where you might be very vulnerable.\n\nIt will take a bit of time to get over the pain of all this, but I promise that it does get better and you will feel very happy again.",

I tried to suppress everything and ended up prolonging the healing process for many many years. Allowing yourself to go through it is the only way to grow from it. \n\nI promise there is sunshine and rainbows on the other side of the clouds. You\u2019re stronger than you think.

I too felt grief and confusion in the week or so following, TREMENDOUS grief. </p>\n\n<p>Then I realized my life was better. I was living it to serve myself. </p>\n\n<p>Then I moved forward and realized the ways this relationship had horribly damaged me, and I felt angry, and I told myself I would run from any behavior resembling what I had been put through, and I have.</p>\n\n<p>When we\u2019re young it\u2019s so easy to feel mature for yourage, sometimes we ARE and I\u2019m not discrediting that fact. But we simply have NOT had enough time to experience different kinds of relationships and understand what abuse looks like, what true happiness looks like, and unfortunately...\nhow to reconcile them overlapping. \nWhich they never ever ever should. </p>\n\n<p>You are NOT a failure.</p>\n\n<p>You are brave for having left him, you showed him that he CAN NOT treat people the way he treated you, and THAT is a success. </p>\n\n<p>Take your misplaced energy and find purpose in warning other young girls the dangers of being in the situation you just got yourself out of. </p>\n\n<p>Realize that this was just the start, and it was going to get much, much worse. </p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to DM me if you need have questions, need to vent, or just need a space to work through complicated feelings with someone who has BEEN THERE. I promise you, I won\u2019t judge, I\u2019ve been through some <em>shit</em>.</p>\n</div>",

He's trying to make you think you need him more than he needs you, and by extension make you think that you can't do better, so it's your \"duty\" to keep him, not the other way around. \n\nDO NOT FALL FOR IT. You deserve so much more than this, and his behavior is not normal or healthy. \n\nWhen dread game doesn't work, the next step is love bombing. At some point, weeks or months from now, he's going to magically have a change of heart. \"I thought I didn't need you, but now I see I can't live without you. I didn't appreciate you, I see that now. I'm so sorry baby, I promise I'll do better.\" After his emotional withdrawal from you, this love bomb is intended to overwhelm you with emotion and make you think that maybe he really has changed. \n\nHe won't. He's not going to change. He's 31 years old and he knows exactly what he's doing. If you go back to him then he'll know he can do whatever he wants and you won't leave. \n\nAnd when these tactics don't work, he'll see it as an insult to his ego and he's going to try to punish you for it. He's going to make this divorce ugly, and do everything he can to cast you as the \"psycho\" so he can preserve his own reputation. He doesn't want to be seen as the instigator of a failed marriage, he wants to be the upstanding and honorable victim of a \"crazy\" ex wife. Hire a lawyer now and document everything you can. Save every text message, and try to only communicate by text or email.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>His disinterest is a tactic to try to get you to come crawling back. In predatory circles this is called &quot;dread game,&quot; it&#39;s manipulative and abusive. He&#39;s trying to make you think you need him more than he needs you, and by extension make you think that you can&#39;t do better, so it&#39;s your &quot;duty&quot; to keep him, not the other way around. </p>\n\n<p>DO NOT FALL FOR IT. You deserve so much more than this, and his behavior is not normal or healthy. </p>\n\n<p>When dread game doesn&#39;t work, the next step is love bombing. At some point, weeks or months from now, he&#39;s going to magically have a change of heart. &quot;I thought I didn&#39;t need you, but now I see I can&#39;t live without you. I didn&#39;t appreciate you, I see that now. I&#39;m so sorry baby, I promise I&#39;ll do better.&quot; After his emotional withdrawal from you, this love bomb is intended to overwhelm you with emotion and make you think that maybe he really has changed. </p>\n\n<p>He won&#39;t. He&#39;s not going to change. He&#39;s 31 years old and he knows exactly what he&#39;s doing. If you go back to him then he&#39;ll know he can do whatever he wants and you won&#39;t leave. </p>\n\n<p>And when these tactics don&#39;t work, he&#39;ll see it as an insult to his ego and he&#39;s going to try to punish you for it. He&#39;s going to make this divorce ugly, and do everything he can to cast you as the &quot;psycho&quot; so he can preserve his own reputation. He doesn&#39;t want to be seen as the instigator of a failed marriage, he wants to be the upstanding and honorable victim of a &quot;crazy&quot; ex wife.

Like keeping a budget. Not a lot of mature/older people are gonna date someone who can&#39;t keep a budget. So they seek a younger partner, because they won&#39;t care about the budget or might suck at it too. </p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;m kind hesitant to even call this person a predator, because they&#39;re kind of just going for people on their level. Kind of natural, even if the younger people don&#39;t realise this about them. And he&#39;s not outsmarting the younger people because he&#39;s on their level. They could get this same shit from people their own age. </p>\n\n<p>But then there&#39;s this FUCKING guy. The other category. The guy that seeks out younger people because he knows his shit is unacceptable and he can only get away with it with younger people. He&#39;s seeking them out to abuse. </p>\n\n<p>One is plain evil and the other is childish and we shouldn&#39;t combine them.</p>\n</div>",

I can never recommend this awesome show enough.\n\n* Strong Woman Do Bong Soo (romance/comedy): A woman who, like her maternal family for generations, secretly has Herculean strength but really just wants to live a normal life and fall in love.\n\n* Secret Garden (romance/supernatural/comedy): An absolute badass movie stuntwomen and a uber-rich second generation heir to a shopping mall get cursed to switch bodies despite initially hating each other (think Lindsey Lohan in Freaky Friday but with hot people with some real chemistry), and discover a lot about each other and themselves along the way.\n\n* The Master's Sun (drama/supernatural/romance): A woman who is cursed to see ghosts everywhere she meets a rich CEO whose touch chases the ghosts away, and does whatever she can to get hired as his secretary. But does this rich man have some ghosts of his own?\n\n* Lucky Romance (comedy/romance): A superstitious woman and a game company nerd CEO.\n\n* Pinnochio (romance/drama): A girl who hiccups whenever she tells a lie becomes a reporter and grows up and falls in love along the way.\n\n* My ID Is Gangnam Beauty (drama/romance): A college student who was bullied for her lack of beauty gets plastic surgery and becomes beautiful, only to now be mocked for being \"fake\", so perhaps the one man who always saw her for who she really is can help her learn true beauty is not what is on the outside.\n\n* Because This is My First Life (romance/drama): A homeless woman and a poor man with a house become a fake couple to put off the man's family pestering him for marriage, in exchange for her having a home to live in (as his roommate). But perhaps they can be more than that too.\n\n* Good Doctor (medical/romance): an autistic savant pediatric surgeon proves his doubters wrong.\n\nHit me up if you ever want more! \n\nAlso, Viki is a great streaming service for Asian dramas if you want to get into them, good quality vidoes and it even has timed comments you can see to get a feel for how other people are reacting. :)",
