I hope she can get out of this situation.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: switched some words</p>\n</div>",

It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. \n\nOn the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?\n\nThe first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip \n\nAnd by \"they wanted to cook\" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo \"traditional\" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.\n\nSo it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it.\n\nI screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.\n\nBut he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? \n\nMeg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.\n\nThe argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself \"the help\"\n\nHis dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.\n\nI left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  \n\nThen I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. \n\nI went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things. \n\nAITA for staying on that vacation and using the flight home? ,,,,\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A-plus for planning on having money and definitely a lesson learned to never plan to rely on anyone in this kind of situation. It\u2019s never a problem to have money left over after a trip but boy is it a problem to run out\u2026. \n\nYou tried to handle an uncomfortable and ridiculous, rude situation very well. Do not feel like TAH at all. That dad is TAH and so is the mom. His friends sound like jerks too. So\u2026\n\nI worry about your friend. I don\u2019t even think you should be mad that she didn\u2019t warn you, because she\u2019s the real victim here. She\u2019s grown up with these people, she\u2019s been conditioned by these people. If she hasn\u2019t complained to you and her other friends about them enough for them to have earned a bad reputation, then there are a couple of things happening here and none are great.\n\n1) She still thinks this is a regular, healthy family dynamic. That because they are here family they are good people. It\u2019s really hard to recognize your family as not being good people. If she has had very little exposure to other families, she might literally not understand what is wrong with this picture.\n\n2) She is absolutely embarrassed about how they treat people but is so traumatized she has no way to verbalize this or ask for help. I\u2019m guessing she does not come off as a very confident person, and this family dynamic is why. This kind of control and bullying environment is going to lead to a very confused person who may not feel they have any right to say that they are a victim. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear. SHE IS A VICTIM. I hope that you two can have some very real, deep talks when you\u2019re back. She needs a friend, she needs help and guidance.\n\nCan I ask, how did she respond? Has she texted or called? I can imagine that she might either be embarrassed and not say anything, or act angry because of her conditioning. If she\u2019s angry, it\u2019s more because with this environment, her sympathetic nervous system is probably very reactive and keeping her in fight, flight or freeze mode. If she hasn\u2019t not acted angry but not said anything she could be scared they will know and in freeze mode, or embarrassed, but that would also be freeze. They will likely try to control her every seeing you again, which is why if you\u2019re not on the trip now, you should make it a priority.\n\nHow can you help her? This is tough. What she needs is a good therapist to help her understand what her parents have done to her by reading her line this. Telling someone something like that is not easy. Approach with care and concern. You may need to get through some walls to be able to have this talk. Most importantly, if you had a reaction of being mad at her for not warning you, that\u2019s fair for you to feel that. But keep the above in mind, and try to learn more about the situation before you let her know. Even if they have her brainwashed to be ok with it, she deserves a chance for someone to let her say that this isn\u2019t ok.",

My mom could only give me a very small amount to cover something to eat and she put snacks to share in my bag. \n\nWe got in line and her Dad asked me for my money to buy my ticket.

I can't imagine how he'd have acted if I cried.\n\nWhen we got back he lit into my mom for not sending enough to cover my ticket. Her parents were both doctors. Our whole run down 1br aparentment would have fit in their LR and kitchen. They had been to my house! But he still brought an 8yo home and then berated my mother until she cried. \n\nI don't know what she did to make it happen as our utilities were shut off on the regular and being allowed to buy a bag of chips was a really big fucking deal but two weeks later she invited the same friend to go to the same theme park. My mom paid for her ticket. I'm guessing my friend had the money but my mom never asked.  \n\nMy mom was complete crap a lot of the time, there was parentifaction and neglect, but sometimes she got things right, even if it was only to make a point to someone else.",
