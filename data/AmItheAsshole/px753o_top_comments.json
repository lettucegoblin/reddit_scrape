You think they care about your sadness? You should be angry. I literally would no longer refer to them as my family ever again. I\u2019d walk past them like they were dead if i saw them out anywhere. \nYou need to be angry. The anger should fuel you to get away from them and make your life better WITHOUT them. You don\u2019t deserve this, but you need to stay strong and stop letting them get to you.",

You have every right to feel betrayed and hurt and abandoned. I wish You were my daughter I would give you the biggest hug. They have turned your sister into the golden child at the expense of your life. I hate to say this but you may need to find a family that is not your family. They are pretty horrible and the worst kind of cruel when it comes to you and you deserve better. Family does not have to be blood. Let the go no contact. Block them.

Your parents failed you, but they also failed your sister. They enabled this behavior and created a monster. They set the expectation that you would drop everything to cater to your sister, and they're continuing to enforce that expectation by demanding that you accept her betrayal. Fuck that, and fuck them. You've done more than enough for them, and you don't have to accept jack shit. Honestly, I think no contact would be the best thing for you at this point. You don't deserve to have your sister's illness weaponized against you, and I guarantee that they'll be calling you in the near future to tell you that Ben cheated on her too and expecting you to console her. The best thing to do is jump ship now and save yourself the heartache. Block them on social media, and do whatever it is you need to do in order to heal from this. Best of luck to you, OP. \u2764\ufe0f",

They are not worth any of your time or energy. \n\nI\u2019d send them all a text message stating: \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that I don\u2019t want or need any of you in my life. My own sister betrayed me in a way that is unforgivable. I will never trust her again and without trust there is no family. As for my so called parents, there\u2019s nothing left to say. You\u2019ve made it perfectly clear who you love and care about more. In fact you\u2019ve been doing it since she was diagnosed with cancer and have done it even after she was diagnosed as cancer free. It\u2019s very clear to me that I don\u2019t matter in this so called family, so I\u2019m leaving it. I don\u2019t want you in my life. You\u2019ve showed absolutely no loyalty to me in this situation. A loving and caring mother and father would be on my side in this situation. Anyone with a half a brain would be on my side. How would either of you feel in this situation? What if my father slept with your sister dear stepmother? What if dear stepmother slept with your brother father dearest? That type of betrayal is unforgivable. What\u2019s also unforgivable is parents not having my back. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t want any of you in my life. You will not be there for any future milestone: birthdays, wedding, children, absolutely nothing. I will make damn sure my future children will never know any of you exist because they don\u2019t need to be brought up in a toxic environment. To me you\u2019re all just a memory.\u201d \n\nThen leave it at that.\n\nEdit: The audacity to send you a bill for lunch?! I\u2019d send her and your ex a bill for all the hard work and energy you put into your relationship only to have it destroyed by the both of them. I\u2019d send them a bill for $100/day for every day you and your ex were in a relationship. \n\n365 days x 3 years = 1,095 days. \n\n1,095 days x $100 = $109,500. \n\nOh, and if you\u2019re in a state that acknowledges Common Law Marriage you may need to actually have a legal divorce. Most people don\u2019t realize that common law marriage is real and cohabitation for over a year is usually one of the hurdles. So you may have to have a legal divorce from him. Bright side means you could walk away with some assets, a piece of his retirement, and even alimony.",

My own sister betrayed me in a way that is unforgivable. I will never trust her again and without trust there is no family. As for my so called parents, there\u2019s nothing left to say. You\u2019ve made it perfectly clear who you love and care about more. In fact you\u2019ve been doing it since she was diagnosed with cancer and have done it even after she was diagnosed as cancer free. It\u2019s very clear to me that I don\u2019t matter in this so called family, so I\u2019m leaving it. I don\u2019t want you in my life. You\u2019ve showed absolutely no loyalty to me in this situation. A loving and caring mother and father would be on my side in this situation. Anyone with a half a brain would be on my side. How would either of you feel in this situation? What if my father slept with your sister dear stepmother? What if dear stepmother slept with your brother father dearest? That type of betrayal is unforgivable. What\u2019s also unforgivable is parents not having my back. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I don\u2019t want any of you in my life. You will not be there for any future milestone: birthdays, wedding, children, absolutely nothing. I will make damn sure my future children will never know any of you exist because they don\u2019t need to be brought up in a toxic environment. To me you\u2019re all just a memory.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Then leave it at that.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The audacity to send you a bill for lunch?! I\u2019d send her and your ex a bill for all the hard work and energy you put into your relationship only to have it destroyed by the both of them. I\u2019d send them a bill for $100/day for every day you and your ex were in a relationship. </p>\n\n<p>365 days x 3 years = 1,095 days. </p>\n\n<p>1,095 days x $100 = $109,500. </p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you\u2019re in a state that acknowledges Common Law Marriage you may need to actually have a legal divorce. Most people don\u2019t realize that common law marriage is real and cohabitation for over a year is usually one of the hurdles. So you may have to have a legal divorce from him. Bright side means you could walk away with some assets, a piece of his retirement, and even alimony.</p>\n</div>",

Call up some close friends, get trashed, and have a nice long bitch session\n\nYour parents stole your childhood. It was not your responsibility as a fucking 16 year old to give up your life to cater to your sister's illness. It's awesome that you were willing to get a job and help support the family through it but YOU WERE A KID AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR GIVING UP YOUR OWN LIFE FOR HER.

If I were OP, I would say to all of them:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I sacrificed my teen years for my sister. I worked to pay for her care. Everything I wanted for myself had to take a back seat to her wants. And now, she even felt entitled to my boyfriend. It&#39;s clear who&#39;s feelings and well being matter in this family, and it&#39;s obviously not mine. This is the deepest betrayal, and all you can think about is yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>You all go off and be happy. I&#39;m not going to sit here and pretend everything is hunky-dory when I have been treated like shit by all of you for a decade. No, I don&#39;t want anything to do with my cheating ex or my backstabbing sister, and don&#39;t ever come to me for help or support ever again. I&#39;m busy spending my time and emotional energy on people who actually care about me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Oh my gosh, thank you for all the awards kind Redditors!</p>\n</div>",

Not just an apology - those are just words.  But true repentance - an acknowledgement of the wrong/harm done, acceptance of responsibility and the making of amends.\n\nHas your sister done any of this?  Have your parents?\n\nIt's hard to know where the line is - but let me ask you this are you loving yourself as much as you love them?  If this had happened to someone else you are close to, what would you tell them?  And, what does this say about who your sister and parents really are?
