WTF is wrong with your teacher? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also hoping you report this behaviour, it&#39;s not okay, and the teacher absolutely needs to go on some training, and make a formal apology which acknowledges her ableism. If you do report her, I recommend that you do so with parental support, with someone taking minutes of any meetings, and that you list your desired outcomes (eg. I&#39;d like a formal written apology by teacher which acknowledges this was ableism, and says what she&#39;ll do to improve in future; and I&#39;d like her to go on disability sensitivity training). </p>\n\n<p>If you get a single snide remark or any negative treatment from the teacher after she&#39;s been reported, don&#39;t hesitate to report her again. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck with the new chair!</p>\n</div>",

Of course not, since they also had me using the stairs every time I was on crutches, because students weren\u2019t allowed to use the elevators. Of course my locker was on the second floor.
