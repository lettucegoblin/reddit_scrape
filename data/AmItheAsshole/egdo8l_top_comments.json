As an ex, and as the person to whom primary custody was not granted during a divorce early in my daughter's life, but whom she now chooses to live with 100% despite the meager visitation of \"every other weekend\" in her formative years, I can play the devil's advocate a bit here. \n\nFirst, I would say that, as long as he is a positive influence in her life and remains involved, she will naturally gravitate towards him as she gets older. There shouldn't be a fear that his ultimate position will be usurped by her stepfather. When they're young it is tough because children latch on more strongly to whoever is most prevalent in their daily life. So of course it is tough to see another man/woman - who isn't necessarily a better father/mother to their child so much as a person privileged enough to have more time with them - be closer to their child than them. It can break a person's heart.\n\nSecond, it is vitally important to the relationship between your ex and your child that you are absolutely clear who her father is and how important he is in her life. If he completely ghosted everyone, it would be different - but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Whatever the personal issues you have with your ex, they have no place in her relationship with him and one must do their best not to say or do anything that may color a child's judgement when the person in question has no ability to defend themselves. One can simultaneously be a great parent and a terrible mate. So long as he chooses to be a part of her life, he should be afforded equal priority to yourself, especially considering the limitations to his influence due to time. Who she chooses to look up to as a parental figure in addition to her natural parents is, as you say, her prerogative. Further, what she calls anyone is immaterial. The message regarding how everyone fits into her life, however, is critical. For instance, it appears she sees a difference between \"home\" and \"dad's house\". She should know that both mom's house *and* dad's house are home. This should be a consistent message from both homes.\n\nFinally, I encourage you to be open to the possibility of her father being involved on days when she isn't staying with him. I used to take my daughter to ballet and have dinner with her during the week. I'd take her back and forth from her mother's house to school a couple of days a week on a regular schedule. Once a week, I would tuck her in and read her a story at her mother's house. Of course this helped her mother to have more downtime, helped me to have more time with my daughter, and helped her to see me as more than just a person she has to stay with every other weekend.\n\nIn this case I cannot render a judgement, but I can empathize with all parties involved.",

Whatever the personal issues you have with your ex, they have no place in her relationship with him and one must do their best not to say or do anything that may color a child&#39;s judgement when the person in question has no ability to defend themselves. One can simultaneously be a great parent and a terrible mate. So long as he chooses to be a part of her life, he should be afforded equal priority to yourself, especially considering the limitations to his influence due to time. Who she chooses to look up to as a parental figure in addition to her natural parents is, as you say, her prerogative. Further, what she calls anyone is immaterial. The message regarding how everyone fits into her life, however, is critical. For instance, it appears she sees a difference between &quot;home&quot; and &quot;dad&#39;s house&quot;. She should know that both mom&#39;s house <em>and</em> dad&#39;s house are home. This should be a consistent message from both homes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I encourage you to be open to the possibility of her father being involved on days when she isn&#39;t staying with him. I used to take my daughter to ballet and have dinner with her during the week. I&#39;d take her back and forth from her mother&#39;s house to school a couple of days a week on a regular schedule. Once a week, I would tuck her in and read her a story at her mother&#39;s house. Of course this helped her mother to have more downtime, helped me to have more time with my daughter, and helped her to see me as more than just a person she has to stay with every other weekend.</p>\n\n<p>In this case I cannot render a judgement, but I can empathize with all parties involved.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": ">My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter\n\n>it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather\n\nSo as the child of divorced parents, with step siblings, I have been through 5 divorces (my parents, 3 more with my mom, another with my dad) and I have seen some major games, framing, parental alienation, and all sorts of shit. Regardless of how you and your ex feel about one another, that is his babygirl as much as she is your babygirl. I watched my mom withhold my dads access to my brother and I over the most petty things and for a long time all we had was every other friday, then eventually every other weekend. And you know what, thats not enough time. So I gotta ask, why does your ex not have a pure 50/50. If his home is a safe environment, why? Why does she not live with her dad for a week then come live with you for a week. Its not perfect, but its sure a lot better than her not knowing her dad very well. \n\nSo my question. Did you fight tooth and nail to keep her from your ex? Ya he's mistaken for assuming you made her call your husband daddy and hes lashing out because of how much it hurts to hear his daughter call someone else dad in front of him. She his whole source of pride. But how many other wedges in his relationship with his daughter can be attributed to you?\n\nMy dads an asshole, he's been an asshole all my life. But he's my dad and I am so grateful that my mom wasnt able to squeeze him out of my life with court orders despite how much she disliked him for problems in THEIR relationship, not his and mine. I think its important to remember what matters here. Your daughter and her relationship with YOU and her relationship with HER father. Because he and her deserve that. I don't think it would be right to tell her who she can see as the father figure in her life. But I 100% believe her father should have equal access to his kid as you do because right now he doesnt even have the same amount of access to her that this other man does. \n\nThe difficulty of raising a kid is compounded heavily by divorce and there is no shortage of empathy I have for both you and your ex. The conflicts with you and your ex at best wont end until she's 18.",

We did this to them, broke up their family unit, so now we have to support however they make it make sense in their head. \n\nIf either party complains in court, most likely they'll be told to grow up.

It would damage the relationship she has with her actual daddy. Your ex could end up traumatizing your daughter if her stepmom isnt treating her right. And in my personal experience with small girls, they are very quick to label the people they love with family names. It doesnt sound like her stepmom is very nice to her, and probably treats her like a burden who shouldnt be in the house with \"her\" family.",

        "body": "YTA, to both your child and your ex. Several points here.\n\n1. A lot of people in this thread acting like leaving a relationship and loving the child produced in that relationship are mutually exclusive things. The hell? This guy could be obsessed with his daughter, have an incredible relationship with her, and all of this is something we know nothing about. OP didn't mention anything at all about the quality of her daughter's relationship with her father.\n2. Parents are supposed to guide children. The fact that a 7 year old has decided to call her stepfather \"daddy\" isn't enough reason to allow it to happen. Since when do we allow 7 year olds to make major decisions? I don't recall them being known for being able to make well-informed, educated decisions with significant forethought to the outcome. Does anyone here know what parenting is supposed to be about?\n3. It's extremely important for children to have healthy relationships with both parents, married or not. Allowing the daughter to call her stepdad \"daddy\" blurs the line between what the two distinct relationships between both of them should be. Now, perhaps the dad is uninvolved, I'd say to him \"if you have a problem with her calling him daddy, be more involved so you're the one she calls that,\" not \"fuck off\" like a lot of redditors here are suggesting. It's still appropriate to reign in a child's behavior and help them carve out boundaries in their lives. This is one of them.\n4. Your response to his question about calling his wife mommy doesn't matter. How would you feel if your daughter did? The fact that she doesn't has no bearing on that. Your ex is faced with a problem you're not, but that doesn't invalidate how he feels. You need to genuinely ask yourself how you'd feel if it happened, not dismiss it because it isn't.\n5. Ultimately this should be about your daughter. Remember your role as a parent. This is redundant but you need to define very clearly who her stepfather is and who her father is. It's fantastic she has multiple father figures, and it's fantastic that she has both men in her life that love her. But her stepfather being involved doesn't suddenly make him her daddy. There's only one man that will forever be tied to her, and that's her birth father. As long as he's not an absent piece of shit, it's your job and the job of all three of you to distinguish the difference between the roles of the two of them. For her sake. You are the adult and the parent that is responsible to draw these lines and boundaries and distinctions. She is a child that should be taught what's right, and this isn't it.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA, to both your child and your ex. Several points here.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A lot of people in this thread acting like leaving a relationship and loving the child produced in that relationship are mutually exclusive things. The hell? This guy could be obsessed with his daughter, have an incredible relationship with her, and all of this is something we know nothing about. OP didn&#39;t mention anything at all about the quality of her daughter&#39;s relationship with her father.</li>\n<li>Parents are supposed to guide children. The fact that a 7 year old has decided to call her stepfather &quot;daddy&quot; isn&#39;t enough reason to allow it to happen. Since when do we allow 7 year olds to make major decisions? I don&#39;t recall them being known for being able to make well-informed, educated decisions with significant forethought to the outcome. Does anyone here know what parenting is supposed to be about?</li>\n<li>It&#39;s extremely important for children to have healthy relationships with both parents, married or not. Allowing the daughter to call her stepdad &quot;daddy&quot; blurs the line between what the two distinct relationships between both of them should be. Now, perhaps the dad is uninvolved, I&#39;d say to him &quot;if you have a problem with her calling him daddy, be more involved so you&#39;re the one she calls that,&quot; not &quot;fuck off&quot; like a lot of redditors here are suggesting.

They can't be in the same room together and while I don't know the details, I know the divorce went down badly. \n\nBut my dad still sat me down and talked to me about how calling my step mom \"mommy\" would feel if my mom overheard it, and that if my mom ever remarried that he would be hurt if I called her new husband daddy.\n\nI remember laughing about it with my mom because, like you, she wasn't really concerned about me getting a new mom- her parents were remarried too and she knew it didn't really mean anything. But my dad was making a valid point- that's still your kid and it can hurt, and just because it doesn't hurt you doesn't mean it's invalid. \n\nI get that your ex is an insecure tool, and I get that youre not forcing her to say daddy.

Starting this level of warfare this young breeds resentment that just bleeds down to kids, and it's such a small bridge to burn in front of all the ones to come. \n\nBe the bigger person and talk with your ex and daughter about it in a more civil way. Tell him it's something she's started recently, probably because she doesn't want to confuse her brother, and remind your daughter that it hurts her dad's feelings when she says it, and to be extra careful not to say it around him.

He should feel thankful that his daughter has two loving homes and feels love for both adult men in her life. Also, I believe that you wouldn\u2019t have an issue if your daughter felt close enough with her stepmom to call her \u201cmommy\u201d if she chose to, instead of her first name.

Just because she calls her stepmother by her first name does not mean she doesn't love her as much as she does you two.

I was young and it was a shitty situation and I started calling my stepmom a variation of mom and still do this day as a 27 year old woman. I worry that he will heckle her about it everytime he sees her and thats not a great situation for a child to be in without you there to back her up.

My mothers parents were well off, my fathers weren't. My mothers parents hated my father, my mother greatly disliked him just because their personalities clashed. My father is a good father, my mother is a good mother, but they have both done stupid shit to sway me against the other as I grew up, HOWEVER, I lived with my mother solely due to her having more money to fight him in court. He fought for sole custody numerous times, working as many as 3 jobs to do it. As a kid, I didn't think anything of it because i was a stupid kid. As a teenager, I hated my dad because while I wanted to go to parties, I had to go for visitation every other weekend due to a court order. My dad eventually gave in around my sophomore year but always asked me to come live with him, but I grew up with my mother all my life so I never wanted to. I didn't realize how much I probably hurt my dad by not wanting to come visit because of selfish reasons that every teenager goes through.\n\nTo show how similar my situation was to this situation, My mother immediately started dating another guy before I was even born, and so did my dad with another woman. They are both amazing step parents, however since I lived with my Mom, I eventually started calling my step father dad, which my dad \"A LOVING DAD BTW\" did not like, and it was up to my mom AND my step dad to shut that shit down because guess what, if the father cares enough to be upset by it, he is probably a good or at the very least decent father and it hurts to see another man be called daddy by their kid. I was only 5 at the time, nearly the same age as OP's daughter now when I started doing that. My mother and step father talked it out with me present and it made me understand the difference. In this situation, My mother and step father would be the asshole if they let it continue. Now that I am an adult \"31\" I would resent my mother as I got older I grew to appreciate the sacrifices my father made for me while my mother held him at bay with a  court order to only \"2 weekends a month btw\" visitation.\n\n Sorry for this wall of text but these comments calling him a piece of shit for leaving etc when he is very obviously still involved with his daughter leads me to believe there are two sides to this story. Regardless of their personal differences, we do not have enough information to call it one way or another, however if the father is anything like mine was, OP is the asshole and when the daughter grows up and starts to think for herself and has a shred of morality in her to realize her father was a good father and how much she probably hurt his feelings, she may resent OP for it because I sure would have, hell I did for a while in my early 20's to the point where I didn't talk to my mother for nearly a year when I found out how much my mother tried to fight for sole custody while my father worked 3 jobs just to get 2 weekends a month. My father didn't tell me this btw, I learned this from my fathers youngest sister who is only a few years apart from me to the point where her and I are basically brother/sister.",

Different kids in different lives might feel differently than I did. \n\nMy advice though would be to keep consistent contact with your son even when he isn\u2019t with you. Phone calls, texts, that kind of thing. Keep up with the going-one of his life. For me, a big part of why my dad felt so distant is because he didn\u2019t really know what my life away from him looked like. We would talk of course, but he didn\u2019t know my friends, my hobbies, or what I did every day. If your son feels like you\u2019re in the loop, he\u2019s much more likely to feel close to you, even if you\u2019re not physically present. \n\nThe other thing is to try and make the time you do have together count. Do fun stuff! Make memories! Have things for him to do at your house! After all, quality matters just as much as quantity - so make sure he is enjoys his time with you as much as he can, and looks back on it fondly. My dad never did this. The days I spent with him were usually boring and uneventful, which led to me disconnecting from him even further - I had a whole fun life at my moms house, and going to his felt like a boring waste of time.

Part of that is accepting that it\u2019s not a competition. The fact is, there are going to be differences in how your kid sees his full-time parent and how he sees you - but that doesn\u2019t mean he loves you less, or thinks less of you.
