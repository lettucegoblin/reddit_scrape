He was controlling and moody and insecure and liked to whip out the silent treatment when he didn\u2019t get his way. But the woman loved him because he wasn\u2019t ALWAYS like that \u2014 in between these little episodes, he was SUPER nice to her.  One would almost call it \u201c[love-bombing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing).\u201d (Spoiler alert: it was love-bombing.) And besides, he only acted out like that occasionally, maybe once every six months. It was like he had a slow burn and would bottle things up and then just had to let it out every once in a while. She thought she could live with that for the many months of niceness in between. \n\nSo she married him and had two kids. And once the kids came and the expenses mounted and life became more complicated, he became more and more controlling and those outbursts increased in frequency and severity until she was just constantly walking on eggshells, a withered husk of the person she once was, and felt like it was all her fault because he insisted it was. \n\nIt took her 16 more years and a restraining order to escape, because he monitored and controlled her finances, her communications, and her travels.  Getting free was the best thing that ever happened to her, but the 16 years leading up to it just about killed her in more ways than one. \n\nThankfully, this was my story. I say \u201cthankfully\u201d because some women with similar stories don\u2019t escape alive. \n\nDon\u2019t do this to yourself. Walk away now, while you still can. \u2764\ufe0f",

How lucky he is, how much of a lucky man he is to have you. Thank everyone for coming??? </p>\n\n<p>Not boasting about a house. I\u2019d seriously consider a prenup to protect yourself. That\u2019s if you decide to go through with your wedding. </p>\n\n<p>As this &quot;man&quot; is gaslighting you by what I\u2019ve read in your replies. This is a form of mental abuse. </p>\n\n<p>You said that you are the one who always apologises even when he is in the wrong, you really need to stop with this as by this he is getting away with the behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>He has either borrowed money off someone and needs this in the speech to show that the money went to the house instead of what he really spent it on OR He is just trying to make himself look better than he is. </p>\n\n<p>You should be the biggest confidence boost for him not materialistic things.</p>\n</div>",

What is your fiance hiding? YES, this is a hill to die on because there is something sinister fueling his request: toxic masculinity, narcissism, financial deception, desperation to cover up lies - or any number of unsavory scenarios. Why does this man need to make you complicit in his deception? He's not asking you to go along with a harmless white lie - like pretending to love his mother's hideous, gaudy new diamond ring. Your (hopefully soon-to-be EX) fiance is hiding something. Please open your eyes. Do not legally bind yourself to this man. Marrying him would be a terrible mistake. It's time for YOU to give him the silent treatment by calling off the wedding ASAP and making his life as uncomfortable as possible so that he will get tf out of the house! Your heart will feel broken and you will do a lot of crying, but don't let him see it. You need to put on some heavy emotional armor because if he sees a crack in your resolve, he will manipulate it. That's what narcissists do - and he certainly sounds like one.\n\nIf you are concerned about your fiance's lies and mind games now, just wait until he has you locked down! Calling off a relationship is hard, but dissolving a marriage is much, much harder. And if there are kids involved, divorce will be one of the most emotionally grueling, monumentally difficult experiences you will ever go through. \n\nIt's time to do some reflecting and soul searching. Ask yourself if you're in a codependent relationship. Are you allowing a narcissist to use you as a doormat? This guy makes you feel so anxious with his silent treatments that you say you're sorry just so he will talk to you again. He has you apologizing for things you shouldn't be apologizing for! Are you are so desperate for him to return to his \"nice guy\" persona that you will accept blame despite being blameless? Listen to me mami: No! Just NO! Extricate yourself from this relationship ASAP! Keep in mind that in a divorce settlement, this man could potentially get half the value of the house rather than the 30% he contributed. This guy does not sound trustworthy or financially deserving of anything above the 30% he contributed. Obviously you love this man, so breaking up with him won't be easy - but please listen to the advice people are giving you here. Sure, it's easy for a bunch of Redditors to say \"dump him\". We may not be walking in your shoes, but many of us have walked in similar shoes before and we know what those blisters feel like! People on the outside looking in can often spot traits that you would rather overlook. But don't just listen to the online ramblings of strangers you'll never meet - please discuss this situation with trusted family members and friends who want the best for you. It might even be wise to speak to a counselor. I don't want to make assumptions about your self esteem, but please do a deep dive into yourself and ask yourself why you'd be willing to settle for a man who lies, plays mind games, and does not want to acknowledge that the house he lives in was made possible by YOUR hard work and money management skills. Not only does he not want to acknowledge your large financial contribution towards the new home you both share, but he wants to take full credit for it! To put it bluntly, fuck him - and not in a fun way.",

I always figured I&#39;d emulate my parents, but circumstances for my wife&#39;s career didn&#39;t work out that way, and my career happened to go the other way, so my income is the majority of our income. And my wife steers the ship. I&#39;m just the motor. But if her career were to recover to the point that she were working full time, we would hire people to manage the things we didn&#39;t have time for. I know my parents&#39; careers were never as taxing as mine is, but I still don&#39;t understand how they managed everything.  </p>\n\n<p>The idea of not acknowledging my wife&#39;s contribution... I can&#39;t imagine that. I&#39;ve worked with men like that, and they always leave me feeling a bit grimy, somehow, whenever a conversation veers into personal, or even basic social, territory.</p>\n</div>",
