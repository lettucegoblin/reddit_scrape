My Mom always dusted and vacuumed on Saturdays and about one every month or so my Dad would tell her to go do her crossword and he did the cleaning. He also fixed every single goddam thing in the house and did all of the yard work except my Mom planted a little flower garden. He drove us around.\n\nThis husband makes me really angry. And I'm really scared that young people these days actually look back and think that traditionally women were servants. (Actually traditionally humans lived in egalitarian societies.

FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.\n\n\nThey fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing.

Nothing hurts like dismissal and isolation. I would have happily suffered a beating for the sake of feeling validated.

Thank God my mom knew how to navigate it with me specifically, she brought it up privately a few times to tell me how she felt, ask if I was okay, and let me know she was there if I needed help in any form. Even just to vent. Because she'd been in the same shit with my dad. However. I did have a couple people, my brother and mainly my now-SIL, make mocking jokes not dissimilar to OP's post, and it made me so much more miserable when I was alone with him. I realized it was bad and not their fault, but I was so deeply manipulated by that point that it instead made me think it was my fault for not preventing it. For not keeping him happy, 'cause God knows if I could do that he wouldn't be mad anymore! He'd be sweet and attentive and fun again, so easy! /s\n\nI can't say OP's move won't help the sister, just as you can't say that it will. Our experiences aren't hers, I just hope something clicks in her mind to leave before something even worse happens. I'm only saying that when an *outsider* not only points out the real person beneath a fake perfect mask that narcissistic abusers love to create, but *humiliates* them at the same time, in their \"own house,\" making their *victim* laugh along, it can make \"the abuse that was gonna happen anyway\" far more violent and volatile than it would've been over dinner on the counter vs the table.\n\nOP is NTA, I disagree with the e s h vote. Feels too much like blaming him for the abusers actions, and I do appreciate that he stood up for his sister and made her laugh a bit. BUT that doesn't mean it's recommended. The most dangerous and potentially fatal times for abused women are when they're pregnant, or leaving. She may be doing both, hopefully, and these kind of stunts could escalate his abuse far more quickly than it would've otherwise and that isn't a risk I suggest OP take for his sister or himself. If BIL feels his control is challenged, it's very likely to get much worse. I hope that when AH is at work, OP talks to his sister about his fears and all of this and let's her know he supports her. I'd just hate for them to get hurt because a psycho got his ego cracked. OP didn't do anything wrong, I only want them to be more careful and get the hell away from this guy.",

He is more likely to escalate while she's pregnant. OP, you pissed off an abuser *because* he's abusive and then left your sister alone with him at the MOST vulnerable point in her relationship. If you want to help her, quietly exist within view as much as possible. He's less likely to turn physically violent when there's a witness. Do NOT deliberately piss him off and leave your sister alone with him to take the fallout. Tell your sister you support her, you're concerned about the abuse, and that you'll do whatever you can to help keep her and her kids safe (if you're wiling to be a support to keep them safe). In this situation, where you're underage and still in high school and she's pregnant, probably the best you can do is be a witness and plan for when you get a job to be available to help your sister get out if she's ready. She won't even be able to think about it when the baby comes, she's be half dead and barely existing for months, at least, while he likely still expects her to wait on him hand and foot. So it may be a huge help to gather information and have it organized - like what DV orgs are around your area, what shelters, legal aid, etc. Don't let him find out you've got this info, of course.

Most people will excuse it if it's only once in awhile because they're conditioned to other abuse so it doesn't seem that bad. Be a perspective.
