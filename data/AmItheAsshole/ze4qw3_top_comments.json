We don\u2019t know if weight is something you\u2019ve struggled with, and maybe being 190 lbs is something you worked hard towards and having someone point out that you\u2019re \u201cbig\u201d was hurtful. Regardless, the friend is 14, not 4, she\u2019s capable of knowing what is and isn\u2019t okay to comment on. </p>\n\n<p>And I agree with others, teenagers make mistakes and say the wrong thing sometimes, but they are also capable of admitting that their words hurt. You aren\u2019t asking for much, and this is a good lesson for socially awkward people (I myself am socially awkward) to learn what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to say. You\u2019re daughter will learn that you can\u2019t just say whatever you want without consequence, and that acknowledging you\u2019re wrong is a way to grow from a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>Your feelings about this are valid, even if you\u2019re the adult in the situation, you\u2019re also raising children and teaching them to be contributing members of society, and that includes apologizing and acknowledging when they\u2019re wrong and have hurt someone.</p>\n</div>",

If the friend is difficult after that point, then there can be some consideration of whether this is someone they want coming over. Seems like she's just making a fairly simple situation more complicated than it has to be.

I smiled and said \u201cyup, I do!\u201d And we moved on. The kid was smiling and dancing around eating his carrots.

We were eating a snack and the younger boy goes \u201cI love carrots!\u201d And I said \u201cme too!\u201d And he had a big cheery smile on his face and said \u201cyeah and you have really big teeth to eat them with, too!\u201d And I could tell he meant no harm even though the words stung because I\u2019ve been made fun of for my big teeth my whole life. I smiled and said \u201cyup, I do!\u201d And we moved on. The kid was smiling and dancing around eating his carrots. And I don\u2019t even like kids, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a big deal. </p>\n\n<p>I know that\u2019s a bit different, but the thing is that OP\u2019s an adult and the \u201cinsulter\u201d was a child.

        "body": "Seriously. I did a similar thing at 15 (not insulting anyone, just awkward and making dumb teenager choices after I got emancipated), and I was staying with a friend for the summer (end of July through August, and stayed with other friend through October and moved to a new city in November). I tried to help with chores and offered money for my stay, but they wouldn't let me help *at all*, and then would bring up money and expenses and make me feel terrible. \n\nI was staying with them in upstate NY (I am from Tx, met my friends up there through World of Warcraft, saved up money and came to visit), and I ended up bonding with her kid more than another friend I came to visit. My friend wanted me to stay with them, so with their permission I did for a while until I found a place to stay in town. I was sleeping in a heated barn out behind their house, too, not in the house. \n\nMy friend saw I was lonely a bit (since I came across the country from Texas), and since I was there possibly permanently (in NY, not their backyard), they got me a kitten.\n\nShe BLEW UP. Apparently not allowed (even though they have barn cats and it wasn't in the house itself). It went downhill fast. *She locked me out of the house in the snow without a coat* because she \"just didn't like me\" and \"was worried I was going to take her child away from her\". My friend's parent started hounding and harrassing me for not being more like my friend's other friends. She was an older woman who had a boob job and walked around without a bra, around her childrens' friends.\n\nI got a yeast infection (sorry, TMI) and went to a local Planned Parenthood-like clinic. I came home, did the treatment, no big deal (I thought). The next day, she comes running up to me and my friend with a paper in her hand, calling me a whore. She was ranting and raving . \"IT'S NOT DEBBIE DOES DALLAS, IT'S LUCKY-FU DOES TEXAS. WHY ARE YOU GETTING INFECTIONS LIKE THIS? I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU IS FRIENDS WITH MY CHILD, YOU ARE DIRTY\" I realized she had been going through my things in the shed, because it was my clinic paperwork that was under my bed inside my suitcase. I had 0 defense (grew up in narcissistic household and was the scapegoat). I just cried.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Seriously. I did a similar thing at 15 (not insulting anyone, just awkward and making dumb teenager choices after I got emancipated), and I was staying with a friend for the summer (end of July through August, and stayed with other friend through October and moved to a new city in November). I tried to help with chores and offered money for my stay, but they wouldn&#39;t let me help <em>at all</em>, and then would bring up money and expenses and make me feel terrible. </p>\n\n<p>I was staying with them in upstate NY (I am from Tx, met my friends up there through World of Warcraft, saved up money and came to visit), and I ended up bonding with her kid more than another friend I came to visit. My friend wanted me to stay with them, so with their permission I did for a while until I found a place to stay in town. I was sleeping in a heated barn out behind their house, too, not in the house. </p>\n\n<p>My friend saw I was lonely a bit (since I came across the country from Texas), and since I was there possibly permanently (in NY, not their backyard), they got me a kitten.</p>\n\n<p>She BLEW UP. Apparently not allowed (even though they have barn cats and it wasn&#39;t in the house itself). It went downhill fast. <em>She locked me out of the house in the snow without a coat</em> because she &quot;just didn&#39;t like me&quot; and &quot;was worried I was going to take her child away from her&quot;. My friend&#39;s parent started hounding and harrassing me for not being more like my friend&#39;s other friends. She was an older woman who had a boob job and walked around without a bra, around her childrens&#39; friends.</p>\n\n<p>I got a yeast infection (sorry, TMI) and went to a local Planned Parenthood-like clinic. I came home, did the treatment, no big deal (I thought). The next day, she comes running up to me and my friend with a paper in her hand, calling me a whore. She was ranting and raving . &quot;IT&#39;S NOT DEBBIE DOES DALLAS, IT&#39;S LUCKY-FU DOES TEXAS. WHY ARE YOU GETTING INFECTIONS LIKE THIS? I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU IS FRIENDS WITH MY CHILD, YOU ARE DIRTY&quot; I realized she had been going through my things in the shed, because it was my clinic paperwork that was under my bed inside my suitcase. I had 0 defense (grew up in narcissistic household and was the scapegoat). I just cried. And she felt triumphant.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I wasn&#39;t there much longer and my friend and I didn&#39;t really stay close either.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll never forget it.

There is nothing wrong with being a bigger woman just like there is nothing wrong with being a smaller woman. I get called a smaller women at times and it doesn't offend me, so why should it offend her that she was called bigger, is the volume to surface area ratio of her body really that insulting to her ? Maybe she's inherently fatfhobic herself. Anyone who thinks the teenager was being rude is an idiot. Observations are not rude.

And my sister went on to tell us how much that actually ended up helping her anxiety forever in her future.

Different communication styles, different ways of receiving the info. But there are many mechanisms and burdens for each of us during communication. \n\nMy dad was always extremely blunt and really gave no mind to how it would be received and my sister and I had a lot of trouble with that growing up. I found it really difficult to make friends because I was a lot like him. My friend group once did an intervention and told me I'm a bitch. I didn't understand. They were like: it's not even really the information, it's the way you sarcastically deliver it without any regard for how it makes someone feel. Took me *a lot* of practice to mimic appropriate social behaviors. \n\nMy sister and I also got really, really close to our dad before the end of his life. We constantly lament about his absence now whenever we need someone to tell us something honestly - and not something we want to hear...

Perhaps it&#39;s a NAH situation, but the daughter&#39;s friend is aware that she said something hurtful (she went quiet), and cracking on someone&#39;s weight is incredibly hurtful. Apologies are tough, but she can do it. </p>\n\n<p>I am a healthy-weight person. Nonetheless, when a preschooler -- in a fit of rage directed at ALL the present adults -- said that we were all &quot;fat and ugly,&quot; I felt self-conscious about my weight (ugliness, not so much LOL).
