This is clearly a tradition they have had for a while and it would be very weird for one partner to tag along. It\u2019s not about them ruining anything by being unpleasant (or fucking batshit as the case may be), there are just different activities you want to do with different people. But then, most normal people would understand that and say \u201cHave a great weekend babe, see you in a couple of days\u201d, maybe have some friends round themselves or just enjoy the peace and quiet, not pull this insane abusive awful move. NTA op, and I hope she\u2019s officially your ex GF by now.</p>\n</div>",

One area, that isn't an area of practice, but an area I am interested in is towing law.  LA has never seen a tow they never liked and just tell them to pay the tow.  Tow law is actually extremely regional, at minimum controlled by state law, and in many cases by city or county law.  Yet, people just tell people to pay the tow guy without even knowing the location.  California, for example, has extremely strict tow laws -- almost every tow that occurs in less than an hour is illegal -- while other states, like Utah (which is updating at the end of the year IIRC) is basically the wild fucking west.   \n\n\nAlso, yeah, as a public defender for years, I've forgotten more crim law than the average cop knows.
