It was so hot that summer, and I said \u2018fuck it.\u2019 I asked my mom to shave it, told her I\u2019d want to do it for a while. She was so afraid to, telling me I\u2019d hate it and then be mad at her for doing it, but I assured her I didn\u2019t care. If I hated it, I had all summer for it to grow back. She shaved it, and I loved it. Kept it like that all summer. I\u2019m glad I did it, it was fun and honestly really liberating. Shaving your head as a woman is completely different than it is for men. I wouldn\u2019t do it again because the growing out process sucked, and I never realized how much your hair soaks you the sweat on your head instead of just beading you and running down your face. But it was a nice summer cut for a while and I\u2019m proud of myself for pulling the trigger on it. Good for you, OP. Let her learn her own likes and dislikes, her own way.

It struck a chord. I started looking up images of women with shaved and pixie and short cuts. \n\nI made my decision and couldn\u2019t be happier! I have super short hair now, and as I was getting it cut all I could think of was, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my neck before, or my jawline, or my ears!\u201d My dad used to joke about my adoptive grandfather\u2019s ears and my grandpas, so I was always self conscious about mine. I LOVE not having to deal with long hair, saving Maloney, but most importantly: people see my FACE instead of concentrating on my hair.\n\nIn the next thirty years, I\u2019ll have saved over 10,000 hours, over $3500 in product, and $10k in haircuts -not to mention all the curling irons, hair ties and ponytail wraps and they next best thing\u2019 always popping up to buy. \n\nEvery single woman I see who cuts her hair suddenly becomes ten times more beautiful because her features POP into focus and her smile becomes this flashing grin!\n\nYour daughter is thirty years ahead of me, emotionally!

Lace fronts allow the hairline to naturally blend with the skin, while fashion/costume wigs have no hairline and look quite fake, unless it&#39;s a good quality fashion wig with bangs.

The hair will grow back if you hate it and there are wigs and hats.  I was nervous, but I have ZERO regrets!  I honestly am considering making this my new permanent hairstyle after keeping it buzzed these past couple of months.  It's liberating and I love not having to do shit to my hair!",

She will continue to do well as she gets older!\n\nFWIW, I shaved my head at one point about 20 years ago. Didn't have much money at the time, desperately needed a haircut, treated myself and went to an expensive salon. My hair is a bit fussy and just won't hold a style. I told the stylist to cut it in a way that it wouldn't need to be styled (I don't even own curling irons, etc because they're useless on my hair), and NO SOCCER MOM HAIRCUTS.

It's just hair, I don't really care that much, but it was the fact that I spent a ton of money I really couldn't afford to spend at a froo-froo salon and got the exact thing I DIDN'T want. So I shaved off that expensive haircut, and I never regretted it.\n\nFast forward to current times...with the whole shutdown thing, my hair was getting unruly and I just couldn't handle it anymore. I gave my teenager the clippers and said, \"Have at it!\" Well...I'm now sporting a mohawk, lol. I've gotten a lot of compliments, actually (I was kind of surprised, TBH), but I'm not so sure I like it. It doesn't really feel like it's my style, y'know? I'm gonna let it be for a bit, keep the sides trimmed down, because I may as well have a little fun with it. I'll probably shave it off in a couple weeks, NBD.\n\nThe bragging rights are kind of cool, too. I'm female, but I've shaved my head AND had a mohawk on separate occasions...as an adult!

He felt that my brother\u2019s hair was an embarrassment to him and the image that he had for our family. This is just one example where my father felt that anything he didn\u2019t agree with was wrong, would be bring shame to him, and make him look like a bad parent. My brothers and I were discouraged from pursuing anything outside of what he thought was \u201cnormal.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>His actions were extremely controlling to the point that I didn\u2019t truly feel free after moving to the other side of the country, and even for a few years after his death. We had basically no relationship for about the last 10 years that he was alive other than when I\u2019d go to visit my parents house.</p>\n\n<p>My advice, encourage your kid to express herself and intervene when necessary.</p>\n</div>",

Over hair?</em> I thought.</p>\n\n<p>Sure enough, here comes her father, to see what his daughter is fawning over. When he sees my child, he says, &quot;If my daughter did that, I&#39;d kill her.&quot; We walked off shortly after that.</p>\n\n<p>OMG, it&#39;s hair. More importantly, <strong>it&#39;s my daughter&#39;s hair</strong>. If she wants to dye it, shave it, let it grow down to her bum, it&#39;s hers to do with as she pleases. My mom (who dyes her hair) loves it, and asks me all the time, &quot;What color is my granddaughter&#39;s hair this week?&quot;</p>\n</div>",

As she grows older, this support will help your daughter feel safe coming to you about tougher life questions. If you keep this up you can be the one to guide her toward safer sex, steer her away from heavy drugs or early drinking, help her learn how to cut toxic people out of her life and generally work to ensure she loves and respects herself.

That camaraderie will mean that she\u2019ll tell you things that the kids of stricter parents will never hear about until it\u2019s too late.\n\nSo good job.
