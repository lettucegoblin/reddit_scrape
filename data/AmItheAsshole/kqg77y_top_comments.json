Yes we did need to adapt at times, and sometimes  plans were ruined by a meltdown, but we always made sure that his sister had extra privileges and opportunities to make up for the hard stuff.

For example, she went overseas with me for two weeks while he spent summer vacation with his mom. She got a car for 16th birthday. And as long as she keeps her grades up and works when able, she has the freedom to do what she wants.\n\nWhen she was little, there were times she resented him. But we told her that was ok. We have always let her know that we struggle too. We are trying and if we make mistakes we\u2019ll correct it. \n\nAlso, routines are very important. There is no doubt. However, we don\u2019t live in a vacuum, and as kids with autism get older they too will have to deal with change. It\u2019s our job to help make these changes go smoothly but also to prepare them. What will your brother do when they are too old to care for him? His whole life will change.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through this. I would suggest family therapy without your brother. I will say that many parents have severe grief and guilt over having a child with impaired cognitive function. I came in as outside observer and was able work with my stepson without getting manipulated in the way that his dad would. When you see your kid suffering you just want it to stop.

Thank God we had an amazing school, and also received ABA training through our county. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry your parents let you down.

You didn't deserve to be robbed of your life like that and I hope that you can find peace & healing and that your parents can realize their mistakes (don't count on that though)\n\nI am autistic (considered high functioning but the autistic community doesn't  like functioning labels as it dismisses our need for help/assistance as well as the fact that on some days I can become low functioning as functioning levels can and DO change) and from the age 11-18 I was made to care for my older autistic (mostly nonverbal) brother every single day before/after school, on weekends etc. and I wasn't able to go anywhere or do anything. No friends, no job, no sports, nothing....unless I could find and pay for a babysitter myself smh. And no one noticed my own struggles with my neurodivergency as they were focused on my brother's \"issues\" which were actually just a product of them being abusive. Actually autistic people can thrive when they aren't being abused and have the proper supports in place but most often autism is only noticed by the \"deficits\" or \"difficulties\" ie how it affects neurotypicals unfortunately. I hope one day society can learn to associate autism with the beauty of having a different neurotype instead of just the challenges.\n\nAnyways this situation was ABUSIVE af and your situation is 100% abusive as well.

Oh and my personal favourite, \"Your negativity caused my cancer!\" Lol....I was in a constant meltdown from neglect of course I was negative haha\n\nSo it built up in a lot of resentment toward my brother that I only finally got over once I moved away from my parents and my brother. He's in a group home having a much better life now - thank god as my parents were extremely abusive in other ways.

He\u2019s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he\u2019s got my parents convinced he just doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing, and they don\u2019t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he\u2019s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.\n\nThe problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I\u2019m sorry that they feel that way, but I\u2019m still going. Well here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they\u2019d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.\n\nI got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn\u2019t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I\u2019d just not live my life because of him?\n\nShe started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I\u2019m refusing. My grandpa said he\u2019s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don\u2019t think I need to give them one.

Your sibling is just taking advantage of what your parents are allowing them to do. When you are a parent, you have to learn when to tell your kids no. They don't seem to have ever done that.

And will do anything to avoid dealing with it.</p>\n\n<p>Again, NTA OP. You\u2019re not alone. And you aren\u2019t responsible for your brothers reactions (especially since they\u2019re manipulative).\nYou don\u2019t owe them an apology. You did great.</p>\n</div>",

On the flip side, if the brother is maybe only being perceived as manipulative and is in fact just having a lot of difficulties due to overload and trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; as a survival tactic in an unsupportive environment then I think it would be more fair to call it a meltdown. </p>\n\n<p>Either way this is 100% the fault of the parents and I agree with what you said!</p>\n</div>",

When he used to come for visits at holidays and during the summer/spring break, it was tough for my husband, because he knows that his son is being manipulative (we caught him throwing a tantrum and as soon as he gets his way it\u2019s like a light switch went off and he was fine. It was a total act). If my husband tried to enforce any boundaries or consequences, then he was the bad guy, and considering how little he gets to see his son, he didn\u2019t want his son to hate him, so he started just biting his tongue and treating his son the same as his mom and stepdad do. Any deviation from that caused meltdowns where his son would tell him that he hates him and that he wanted to go home right then (although that happened almost every visit anyway, no matter how much my husband walked on eggshells). \n\nHis son is 16 now, and he literally RUNS his household at home. His mom and stepdad are terrified of upsetting him. And it\u2019s by design. The kid is smart. When he was 14 and his mom and stepdad had another baby, he made some self-pity comments about how he wasn\u2019t important to anyone anymore (because he wasn\u2019t the center of attention for 5 minutes), so they got him into therapy and that\u2019s where he was given the diagnosis. He is barely on the spectrum, but he\u2019s super manipulative. He\u2019s always had meltdowns and tantrums because he was taught from a young age that was how he could get his way, but once he got an official diagnosis at 14 or 15 and figured out if they thought he was a threat to himself they would give him anything he wanted, he started wielding that like a giant weapon to get his way 100% of the time without a fight. \n\nSince being diagnosed, they won\u2019t make him come down here for his dad\u2019s visitation time, they won\u2019t make him answer his dads phone calls or text messages, they won\u2019t make him call his dad back, etc. My husband has not been able to speak with his son for over a year. My husband has been in contact with his sons mom this whole time almost, and figured out his son was lying to her by telling him he DID talk to his dad anytime she asked him to call my husband. And do you know what happened when he got caught lying? He \u201chad an anxiety attack\u201d and there were zero consequences. She won\u2019t even ask him to call his dad now. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for the pandemic, my husband would have already gotten on a plane and flown up there to confront the issue, but I honestly wouldn\u2019t see that going over very well. I\u2019m sure there would be some excuse why his son doesn\u2019t want to see him. My husband, aside from telling him to brush his teeth or make his bed when he is here, Has done nothing to warrant this behavior from his son. Anytime he visits, we plan fun activities or trips, let him play his computer games almost as much as he wants, etc. It\u2019s NOT how either of us plan to raise our own child, but we made exceptions for his son given the circumstances. And after all that, my husband is still the bad guy for some reason. I guess it\u2019s because his son knows that even though we play along, we see what he\u2019s doing. \n\n\nIt just sucks so bad, I feel sorry for my husband. \n\nSorry for the rant.

I don\u2019t really talk about all this with anyone IRL.</p>\n</div>",

And I actually believed them for so long. \n\nYes living by myself has teething problems but I\u2019m a capable human being. The thing that pissed me off was when I cooked for family friends (impromptu they had been out for a big lunch with my parents and then we\u2019re hungry when they started to smell the dinner I was making) the family friends made a comment to my parents like \u201cshe can clearly cook I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re worried about\u201d it made me realise that they had been telling people that they were worried I couldn\u2019t feed myself. WHICH WAS SUCH BULLSHIT. \n\nI\u2019m the best cook out of my friends. Most of my friends are still using cookery books/ recipes for basic meals while I just need a recipe for new dishes but I can just do the basics out of habit. I cooked for the 3 years I was in uni. And I cooked at home sporadically. The reason my parents decided that I couldn\u2019t cook was because \n\na) they always cooked - but they wouldn\u2019t let me cook and my dad hates  all my favourite types of food so I wasn\u2019t allowed to cook my favourite dishes. But Id often start dinner if I was home early. \n\nB) if they went out for dinner without me I\u2019d get take out instead of cooking. THIS ONE PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.  Any time my parents went out I was expected to give them a lift to and from restaurant. The booking was always at a time that meant I couldn\u2019t have dinner before they left so I\u2019d have to eat in between dropping them off and picking them up which left little time to cook and eat.

See what\u2019s in the cupboard and make something new. Dad got so insane over making sure that I didn\u2019t have a takeaway that he insisted I start cooking before they left. So I made a dish I thought would be easy to make a quick carbonara. As soon as I finished cooking he decided he wanted to leave for the restaurant immediately and not wait for me to eat. Cold /reheated carbonara sucks. Also carbonara probably wasn\u2019t even healthier than getting take out. \n\nI\u2019m so glad I moved out.",
