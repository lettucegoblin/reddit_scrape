To get the clubs, she lied (presumably) to Erica for her reason for going to your house alone - I wonder if she would have returned the clubs if there wasn\u2019t video footage that showed her taking then. </p>\n\n<p>Birds of a feather flock together - that\u2019s not to say your fiancee is a thief as well.  But Leah\u2019s behavior is extremely questionable (putting it lightly) to anyone with good character and solid morality.  I would be very wary of Erica\u2019s ability to excuse and deflect about Leah\u2019s actions, as well as her hypocrisy - she won\u2019t go to Leah\u2019s bc she\u2019s \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, but you\u2019re expected to suck it up as Leah disrespects and robs you?</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t put Erica on the papers for the house, full stop.  She\u2019s already thinking of it as \u201cour house\u201d, which in itself is normal for an engaged couple, except she\u2019s acting like it means she can make unilateral decisions about who can enter your home.  I wouldn\u2019t even go forward with the wedding until you guys get in front of a therapist.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;m not even saying break up with her but this needs to get addressed immediately and harshly. Couples therapy. A long and serious discussion. Hell, make her sign a piece of paper acknowledging what the problems are and understanding that this is break up worthy if she refuses to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>You lost the comfort of your home here. You can&#39;t expect every time you leave the house that things won&#39;t be missing when you get back. This is a fucking serious issue. Don&#39;t let her dismiss it. If she does, dismiss this whole relationship.</p>\n</div>",

But I was mentally unwell and trying to fight for a marriage I thought was worth it - but Fuck No! I have zero to do w an appendage on his body. Yet spent 19 years trying to 'do better' so he might get hard and not come after 3 mins.\n\nEven if you get police intervention to stop Leah's pilfering, it's just going to be another thing.\n\nErica doesn't see property the way you do. Does not respect your property over pleasing others (w your property ).\n\nShe may change an aspect of this behavior but it will just evolve about something else.\n\nThis is Her. This is WHO SHE IS. It's not going to change, get better or go away.\n\nIgnore the sunk costs feelings.\n\nYou can definitely meet a person better suited to be married to you.\n\nWe all make justifications about why we love people who harm us - in the long run it will not have been positive for you.\n\nYou sound like a great human who has their shit together. Hold out for a partner who values that. Values you bc you take good care of what it valuable to you.\n\nNot a single thing that I thought were the extra special qualities he possessed that were worth tolerating everything else turned out to have been worth the abuse, harm, disrespect, unkindness...\n\nYou will find a better partner.",

I think if you are sharing a space with anyone, romantic partner or otherwise, you should let them know when someone is coming over. And if it&#39;s someone you know that they don&#39;t really like, definitely ask if it&#39;s okay.</p>\n\n<p>In our entire relationship, we&#39;ve signed leases together and bought our house together. There was no &quot;they&#39;re moving into my place and I&#39;m adding their name to the lease/mortgage&quot;, so every space we&#39;ve shared has felt equal. I think it can be harder to have the same feeling of equality when you move into a space someone had to themselves for any period of time.</p>\n</div>",
