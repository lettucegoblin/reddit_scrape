Extrapolated out for 4 days.\n\nDiapers. For 4 days, honestly I'd have sent probably atleast 30 in case diarrhea happened.\n\nFormula/breast milk plus either cereal or Baby food depending on what stage the baby is at. Figure two cans of formula, and 5 or 6 of baby food since you can never be sure which they'll actually eat in a given day or how much.\n\nA gallon or two of purified water. This is more preference than necessity, but it's still something important. You can never be sure of access to water unless you send your own.\n\nToys. God so many toys. There's teething toys that get frozen for chewing aching gums, soft toys they can bang around safely, play mats so they have a safe soft spot to play. A pack and play which is a child pen that can double as a crib in a pinch.\n\nClothes. Figure three outfits minimum for each day, better four if doable. So 9-12 changes of outfits. And I'm talking onesies and t-shirts, pants etc. So 9-12 of each. Baby will absolutely dirt some of them and washing stuff isn't always an option when alone.\n\nMedicines. Teething gel, acetaminophen for babies, cold medicine too. These are vital for the parent to provide since even an experienced adult has no way of knowing what baby could be allergic to without asking the parent. Easier to just drop off a full container of each. Thermometer and careful instructions how to use it. Babies can't do under the tongue until they are walking and talking and even then, not always possible.\n\nToiletries. So diaper wipes, baby shampoo and soap (usually just the shampoo since it can do both), baby bath tub (very important since a regular bath tub can be dangerous for inexperienced adults with babies), and desitin (diaper rash cream) or baby powder. Plus baby lotion is always good since a great way to calm baby down after a bath is to get them nice and baby smooth, plus it makes for a great fun time.\n\n\nThis isn't to say this is all extensive, or that every parent would have everything on here for a 4 day babysit. But most of this list is stuff that you need for taking care of a 1 year old. Maybe baby Alex was more grown and was past teething, maybe he was fully onto soft foods and didn't need formula. Thing is, as a parent, it was her responsibility to make sure you KNEW these things before she left Alex there. Sure even someone with little to no experience can manage for a few hours. Keep baby corraled, distracted and there's half the work. The other half is feeding and diapers which most people can figure out. But 4 days requires someone who knows more than the basics and her one job as a mother is to make sure his needs are met. It was her responsibility to make sure you were capable of meeting them since she didn't want to. She failed, not you. \n\nHell let's entertain the idea that by the time you called, she was already too damn high to drive. And she never realized how truly inexperienced you are. At that point, her reaction shouldnt have been \"ooops deal with it.\" It should have been \"who can I call to help her for one night while I sober up and come get my kid.\" Or \"who can come grab my kid and watch him for a few hours while I find my way home without driving myself.\" Had she done the latter, then yeah she would have made a bad move but atleast put Alex first as her job for the next 20 years. But by not even doing that, she failed her one job as the woman who gave birth to and then kept Alex. That's on her, not you. \n\nYou did the right thing. You protected that baby boy from your incompetence for lack of a better word. You kept him safe from the absolutely innumerable things that could have and likely would have happened had you kept quiet. Dont feel guilty, be very damn proud. You did perfect.",

If she would have asked that morning for you to take care of her for a few days, and you changed your mind, that would be your right but unreasonable. \n\nIf she wanted to take a spontaneous trip with her friends, she needed to 1) call and confirm that you and your partner would be able to take care of her infant for multiple days 2) pack a bag with her food, diapers, toys etc for the time period. That is what a responsible parent does. As an example, I babysat my friends 2 children, both under 3 for a week. Before she left, she made sure the house was stocked with food for them and me, she made sure to write out their routines, she told their daycare that someone else would be dropping them off and picking them up, she told her neighbors and gave me a couple of their numbers in case of emergency, and we went over the routine for a couple of days prior to her leaving.  Why? Because that is what a responsible parent does before leaving their children with someone , especially when they are babies that either require breast milk or formula, pur\u00e9ed or other infant snacks.  \n\nI empathize that she may have needed a break and was under a lot of stress,  but there is a way to do it properly. If she would have taken a day or two to plan, she would have been able to go on the same trip without consequence. That\u2019s not your fault though. It\u2019s hers.

We had propane, and a fireplace so mom invited her to the house to take a breather and warm up and decide what to do next. While they were there mom suggested the woman grab a shower while she watched the baby since they didn\u2019t have hot water at home, and she could give the baby a bath and just generally take it easy in a warm house during a snow storm.

But an hour passes, then another, and she didn\u2019t really know this woman, and she didn\u2019t answer at home. And it was a blizzard, but mom could see that the car was gone. So she called the police because she was afraid something had happened.

My aunt ended up keeping the kids for two weeks until their father who had no clue about his wife\u2019s issues could get back.\n\nMy point is this. When mothers disappear and don\u2019t come get their kids according to plan, something is generally quite wrong. A reasonable mum makes agreed on arrangements with an agreeable person, and stays in communication unless explicitly otherwise arranged.

Whether that is a factor for the parent doesn't matter as much as long as the child is safe.\n\nMaybe I didn't explain it right, idk. I'm certainly not defending the mom in the post. Or any parent that pulls that. My kid is 9 and I still have issues going to drink or do anything even if she is on a sleep over because the what ifs kill the mood. But I can certainly see why officers may be more inclined to just deal with the weed charges, and let social services see if this something she can be helped with. It's not like the foster system is some great place these days so being with mom might still be better if she accepts help and gets better.\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver!

As I got older (13+) when she would get home from work the first thing she'd do was get in the shower to unwind  so I'd follow her in and sit on the toilet and we'd talk to each other through the curtain and tell each other about our day and stupid stuff.\n\n I moved out at 17 and we didn't really that any more since we didn't live together, but when I hit 25 I got really really sick, I developed several severe chronic illnesses and  I had to move back  in with her so that I wouldn't be alone during the day and it would be easier to for me to get to doctor appointments and hospital visits and the like. From then on  I couldnt work anymore but after a bit I got well enough that having a nurse come by 2-3 days out of the week for a few hours during the day to help me was enough so my mom was able to go back into the office rather then working from home and we just kind of reverted back to to what we did when I was growing up. \nI'd wake up early with her and make us some coffee and I'd sit on her bed or the side the tub and we'd talk and joke around as she got dressed and ready for work, and when she would get home I'd do the same as she showerd and changed into her pjs and have some time together, then I'd usually go back to my room or the livingroom and do my own thing  for the rest of the night.\nEventually I met my husband and got married(its been 4 years now) so of course we went and got our own place and its lovely, though I still at times miss having our little morning and evening hangouts, gossiping and poking fun at each other and being silly together.  We still talk and text every day but its not the same ya know? I love my mom, she's really great.\n\n\nEdit:\n**My first Gold!! Thank you so much kind stranger!!**",

        "body": "I was taught to respect alcohol at a young age. Particularly wine. I was allowed to smell it and ask questions. No one in my family ever had a drinking problem. No one ever got ridiculously drunk. I knew not to touch anyones glass that was not mine and to always watch my drink. I think treating it like a taboo substance makes it worse. My friend never tasted alcohol or been around someone until he was nineteen. He tried a fruity drink with my friends. I bought him his first beer. He was a big dude and the first person i saw drunk out their mind was him and now he\u2019s on a whole lot of drugs. He jumped off the deep end. \n\nIts all about balance and teaching your children respect. Sure I drank underage but I would never get so drunk to the point where I would find myself in a bad circumstance. And even if i did i felt comfortable to call my dad for help. \n\nMy dad doesn\u2019t really drink. He likes the taste of certain things but he cant drink due to him being diabetic. So whenever someone offered him to try something he would offer it to me instead so I can taste it. \n\nHe always drove after and I\u2019ve never driven drunk. \n\nMeanwhile all the people who I know who had alcoholics as parents or family members recognize the difference between drinking alcohol and understanding you have have a serious problem, addiction.\n\nI feel like their exposure and knowing t signs and knowing what it can do to you if better then hiding it. There is nothing wrong with having one glass in front of a child. But if you fear having alcohol out at all... for fear someone would become so incoherently drunk then you don\u2019t enjoy alcohol in its entirety.. the tasting... drinking slowly... pairing it with\nFood.... you only drink to get drunk and this opens up the question of why do you do that? \n\nThat is what leads to addiction.\n\nAnd you are teaching your child that that is what drinking is for and painting a picture in their head that will spark curiosity and literally lead them to drink or tern them into a weird prude who thinks drinking is sin for no reason.\n\nYes drinking is extremely unhealthy. I can count on one hand the amount of glasses of any given alcohol i have a year. \nBut don\u2019t teach your child fear or worse feed into their curiosity by hiding it from them.\n\nThe most I ever saw someone have was two glasses of wine. After that point we either left the family party due to time or if one parent wanted more one would be sober and we would be in bed.\n\nEdit: my point is there is a difference in enjoying something with restraint and addiction. Please properly explain what addiction truly is so they understand. My friend had zero exposure and he thought he was doing what others were doing and that was normal. But he didn\u2019t recognize that he had a huge problem because he was not educated on it and was just taught \u201cdrugs and alcohol are bad\u201d in school. He was like the head of the no drugs and alcohol committee the whole nine. Its sad to loose a greta friend because pf their lifestyle he moved far away and may have gone to rehab idk. I hope he did but I\nDoubt hes clean. Anyone else i knew that was shielded by their parents and controlled dated older men while we were in school, did drugs, sold drugs, all while maintaining their gpa\u2019s because they could afford to pay people to help them cheat or they were high on adheral they could study. \nI lived in an extremely white community.\nIts the same in other communities too its just not hidden under the rug because rich towns can pay people to stay quiet so property value doesn\u2019t drop. Its the same no matter where you live. \n\nAnd with access to the internet they are bound to be exposed at some point so you might as well explain it when they are old enough like five/six to understand not to drink an adult drink so they don\u2019t potentially harm themselves like the child that chugged two mikes hard lemonades/\n\n\nCrazy to see someone flip in such a small span of time like that. Mind you this all happened because his parents went away and he was an only child so he went nuts and it just goes to show how if you don\u2019t have tryst with your kids and they just view you as a figure head directing them in life by hiding things from them how they will combust once they have freedom.",
