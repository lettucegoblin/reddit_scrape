He would start doing things like this. \n\nGrandma: Xtrawolf please come help with the dishes.\n\nBoyfriend: Oh let me help! Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!\n\nEdit: Since people are asking about the 3 grandmas - one is a relative that we call \"Grandma\" but she's not my biological grandmother. My husband also has 3 grandmas - one of his is a step-grandma. You can never have too many grandmas!",

My friend came in shortly thereafter, saw what had happened, and did nothing. When I pulled him aside,  he defended himself by claiming that his grandfather was old, set in his ways, and that it was only one time. He then went to go watch TV with his grandfather. </p>\n\n<p>I dropped the plates on the counter and left.</p>\n\n<p>OP likes it this way. He has no incentive to challenge his family&#39;s sexist ways. He&#39;s going to end up without a girlfriend because he&#39;s too big of a coward to stand up for her.</p>\n\n<p>YTA YTA YTA!</p>\n</div>",
