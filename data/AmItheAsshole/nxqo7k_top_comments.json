And leaving his career to come back to the family business probably seemed like a big sacrifice that needed to be rewarded. \n\nBut not this way.  This isnt a store, or a business business where someone who excels in accounting will be the best to run the show. This is a plumbing company. And someone without plumbing experience at the helm is a surefire way to piss off clients and employees both.\n\nAnd that's before the entire company views it as a stab in the back.\n\nI hate to say it, because it might irreparably destroy relationships. But go out on your own and don't look back. You already know you can run a successful business as you've already done it.

That you had thought you were working towards doing this by building up the family business, and you had understood you were in the process of attaining this ambition by acting as CEO.  That when your brother got involved, you saw yourself doing it in partnership with him, taking on the world together. That you want to get married and have a family, and to provide for them well - every bit as well as your brother wants to provide for his, and if you cannot do this through the existing family business you have no practical choice but to start your own business now. That you understand your admin skills are not perfect, but that you have the technical, leadership, sales and customer relations skills needed, and you can hire in the admin skills if it is not possible to work with your brother. That it was disrespectful and cruel to demote you and cut your pay. That the respectful and logical resolution was that one of the brothers should be CEO and the other COO or CFO, splitting responsibilities, with equal stakes in the business, and making major decisions collaboratively. That you are still open to a solution like this, but only with a legal agreement in place to protect everyones\u2019 interests, structured with advice from professionals expert in agreements for management and succession planning in family businesses, with the business funding you to pay for your own independent legal advice. That what has happened has undermined your trust in your family, and that this is why a formal agreement is needed.\n\nEdit after your update 2: Talk to your father more. Even if your brother has full control over the business as CEO, if your father still has ownership of the business or any of the assets he may be able to take back control and impose a more equitable solution. Your brother seems to be digging hard  to show himself a right bollocks though, so running the business jointly may no longer be a realistic option. A 50% split might now mean you get half the assets and whatever staff and customers want to stay with you.\n\nEdit 2: Looks like two downvotes since the previous edit. Happy to conclude that members of OP\u2019s family have read the comment carefully.",

Your men show you intense loyalty and that is a leader of great stature.\n\nABUSE\n\nEverything you describe is ABUSE, mental, emotional abuse and you have been used. The long term plan has realised and the carpet pulled out from under you.\n\nARROGANCE OF INTELLECTUALS\n\nYour brothers disdain for your skills, his dramatic, monstrous, cut in your wages shows that he does not give a shit for your skills or you as family. He knew you would leave if he did that, come on, he knew, anyone would know that you were hurt and this final blow would remove you...................... so it was a deliberate, cold, calculated move to exterminate you\n\nTHEIR FEARS\n\nThe only reason for the dinner meeting mentioned in your update is to emotionally blackmail you into returning otherwise THEY loose the company. They have come to realise that loosing you will result in disaster for the company. Not sure if your brother realises it though because his arrogance makes him think you are useless and he can do anything. \n\nTHEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL\n\nAfter reading this last update I was stunned. There was no recognition of how you felt, there was no word of compromise, no apology from your brother for the demotion and wage cut nothing. What does that tell you??????????????? They do not care about you, honestly, it was not about you was it, it was about them.\n\nGOLDEN CHILD FOG\n\nJust like a cheater in a marriage is in an Affair Fog and cant see the pain they cause or their affair partner is using them so the parents of a golden child are in a golden child fog. Sadly after 27 years this habit is entrenched very much like a smoker is addicted to a pack a day. You have nuked the affair fog but it returns quickly as demonstrated at the family dinner. It is entrenched because there was, as i said above, no recognition of what has happened to you and how you feel.\n\nEVERY GENERATION REPEATS THE MISTAKES OF A PREVIOUS GENERATION\n\nWe say that history repeats and that is true. What does this mean for you? Well, you are well and truly, completely and totally fucked with your family forever. At least one of them will have downloaded this entire AITAH (probably brothers lawyer too) and they know how you feel. No matter what you do now they will always accuse you of holding a grudge unless you agree with absolutely everything they do until the day you die........... It is a freight train heading your way and you are tied to the tracks. They desperately want to blame shift onto you to void any guilt they feel. It is the classic 'Grow up, its been years now and you need to get over it\" Abusers say this, think about it, it is all abuse\n\nWHERE TO NOW??\n\nLike a spouse who has been cheated on you are vulnerable, those you trust the most have completely betrayed you. The only path to healing is a new life without those abusers in it. This is a well proven path often discussed in reddits about infidelity which is often a similar level of betrayal.  I would advise permanent no contact with your brother because he will take the business competition badly, seriously badly, a plain nasty and vicious reaction. I suggest you can try limited contact with parents, for the sake of future kids, but that might be difficult and damaging to you. Difficult because his kids versus your kids, once born, will create conflict too. The correct pattern is to branch out on your own and your healing from the emotional hit only works with no contact otherwise their presence reminds you of what they did and reopens the wound. \n\nYOU HAVE THE ADMIRATION OF YOUR MEN AND PARTNER\n\nYou have a great foundation for the future, Go out and build your own business, build your own family and your own amazing future",
