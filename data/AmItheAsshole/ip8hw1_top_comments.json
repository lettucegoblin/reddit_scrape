They're knowingly causing you to miss work events, and last minute at that, they lied to you for months (I'm actually surprised you didn't reach out to Mike and GF sooner to ask how Mike was doing, given that they needed help from their friends who lived the next city over multiple times), and they left you with a child for two whole days longer than you agreed to. If all they want is a date night every now and again, that bit is unacceptable. They're just straight up negligent parents. What if something was wrong? If there was an emergency on your end? What if you needed to know some medical information? And they ignored all correspondence from you for *days.* They didn't even care how their kids was doing.

You aren&#39;t required to be at their disposal. </p>\n\n<p>NTA.</p>\n</div>",

When SIL was pregnant I made it clear that I\u2019d only babysit for them in the case of a serious emergency, e.g. someone has a medical emergency. I won\u2019t babysit if they just wanted time off from being parents, because I don\u2019t have the free time for that. I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it\u2019s me. \n\nLast year, my brother and SIL asked me to babysit on the day of an informal work meeting, a lake retreat organized by my company. Everyone is expected to go, and it\u2019s frowned upon if you miss it. They wanted to go on a date. I said no, I have an important work event. They continued to nag me about how they haven\u2019t gone on a date for so long. \n\nThe night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city ever had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they\u2019d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike\u2019s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again. Throughout the next two months, my brother and SIL regularly used the excuse of aiding Mike in his recovery and needing to visit him in order to make me babysit my nephew.\n\nMike\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s company and my company had a meeting two months after Mike\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d. I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike\u2019s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I \u201cgave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie\u201d. \n\nI made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I\u2019ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL\u2019s family. They even sent me proof of the relative\u2019s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn\u2019t care about betraying my trust, so I don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital. They said I was a bad aunt, needed to get over my grudge, and a petty asshole. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She packed one day worth of diaper  and baby food and took off for drugs binge. When OP of that story contacted this mother and ask when would she back,  she replied she is going to some other city for party, OP said he has zero knowledge of child care also he doesn't even have baby food and diapers , if mother wont come back within an hour he would contact police for child abandonment and he did. Mother switched off phone. Police found mother few cities away all drugged up. Eventually case went to CPS. \n\nI was surprised how parents could leave their child and switch off phone for hours or days. When I leave my dogs with caretaker , I couldn't even switch off my mind let alone phone, I check on them often.",

But that is one seriously stressed baby for hair to be falling out.....\n\nI did 6 months in hospital, 24 hours a day with a non verbal relative, chronological adult but who looked like a young teenaged boy.... I was sleeping on a full nightingale ward (non Covid, the usual NHS 24 bed ward) next to relatives bed (a men's ward, I'm a small female -- yes, there were pervs who photographed me/us as we slept). This was during influenza season, visiting relatives coughing and sneezing without covering face or washing hands, during visiting hours...... I have an immune disorder (bacteria can kill me, my own body bacteria can kill me -- I have permanent bacterial UTIs and tonsillitis) and a litany of other health issues, I was running temperature of 40 degrees C (102 for USA people?) -- which means I needed urgent bloods taken and an ITU assessment myself, for potential septic shock...... But I couldn't leave my relative, as it was very literally life-and-death fighting for him daily (and he died, due to the three days the nurses forced me to leave thinking I had influenza).\n\nThat caused me and my mother to get alopecia 4-6 months later. My ensuing nervous breakdown, has caused my mother more alopecia, bang on six months after my first psychiatric admission \"as I was a danger to myself\".\n\nSo it takes *A LOT* of stress to cause someone's hair to fall out.\n\nI have highly complex PTSD, due in part to my childhood and the horror show it was..... My hair was thin, but fine, even with on/off anorexia, very active sports, travelling 2 hours each way to school (equivalent of a USA private school, but funded as run by a church).\nI'm not going into details as the shit I lived through was very specific and would fox me, but no hair loss during childhood. Not even dodgy veganism in a student house, hair thinning, not loss though.\n\nThe human body is at is maximum health until around age 21-24. Then it goes down hill (archaeological medical fact -- I'm a medical sociologist, so I've studied this). \nSo alopecia in children would be *serious* cause for alarm.\n\nI'm sorry to break that to you. You were an immensely stressed out child. Beyond what was reasonable for a child to go through.\n\nIf you have any x-rays for broken bones, particularly thigh bone or upper arm, look at the growth plate region (it's the area where it connects with the main joint: which is hip, shoulder). Look for striated lines on the bone in that region. They're called Harris Lines (give it a Google). It's seen in things like prior childhood anorexia, neglect, or immense stress.\n\nIf you do have Harris lines.... and it's not my place to say, so my apologies: but consider getting therapy if you can afford it. There may be a lot going on in your head currently walled off, that could well burst into a nervous breakdown one day.... I'd hate anyone else to go through what I've gone through and I am still going through. It's the worst thing I've ever had to live through (Career destroying, can't even shower most days, only allowed 7 days of meds at a time, in-out psych hospital in my early 40s -- a breakdown is devastating, and the cherry on the cake, is there aren't any meds for it unless you tip into depression, which I haven't. I just can't function, at all.).\n\nI'm very sorry that happened to you. No child should ever go through something that causes so much stress their hair falls out, and the doctor was remiss in not reporting you for monitoring by child protection.\n\n............\n\n(Edited for clarity and some language change, as noted afterwards the poster is also from the UK)",

My first son- it was bad, but I think I did okay with the anxiety. My second? Worse. Waaaay worse anxiety. I finally realized I needed help and got on an antidepressant/anti anxiety med. I couldn\u2019t have him out of my sight for a second (freaked out about stupid things like when it rained, would a tree fall on the house and hurt him). That could be what they meant. I fully trusted my family and in-laws, but it wasn\u2019t until after that first year that I got better at letting them go spend more than an hour with others. \nJust my experience!
