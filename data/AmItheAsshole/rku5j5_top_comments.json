I literally had to stop at age 12 because I physically could not do what the other dancers could. I wasn't flexible (thank god) and above all I wasn't interested. I felt so guilty because so many girls in my class at school loved dancing.

I think you should try to sit them down, and have a SERIOUS conversation about how you feel. Don't say you hate them.

Parents shouldn\u2019t give kids stupid names, and should let them develop their own interests. You should chill out talking smack about NERDS and NERD STUFF. You\u2019re completely right that wanting to be your own person is fine, but it isn\u2019t cool to crap all over someone else\u2019s interests either.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please recognize that at least some of this is over-dramatic teenaged angst (I would know, I had my angst back on IRC because I\u2019m old), and that tons of kids wish they had a family that wanted to do stuff together. Lightsaber fights may not be your thing, but if that\u2019s their biggest sin, try to find a way to enjoy time with your family around the holiday. You\u2019ll look back on these memories with more fondness than you think right now.</p>\n</div>",

I'm the odd one out and they didn't kill them all for me I didn't like any of it to begin with.\n\nOof, I'm sorry that you're continually made to feel like you're the odd one out in your family. You are NTA, and it's okay that you have different interests from the rest of your family. \n\nIDK if your parents are doubling down bc of their past experience (people with stereotypically \"nerdy\" interests often react to teasing/ridicule by deciding to ignore criticism & clinging harder to what they like for escapism) or not. However, the *whole point* of being a good parent is (1) it's NOT 100% about you anymore, (2) you don't impose your issues/past experiences on your children, and (3) you do your best to keep things fair among the kids.\n\nLike...my parents did not care a lick about video games, but would still ask questions like \"What's happening on the screen?\" or \"Are you winning now?\" whenever they saw me/my brothers playing. And my parents would notice when my younger sister got bored from watching us/playing along, and they'd say \"Video game time is over, go do something else. Where are your Power Ranger toys?\" Because they knew all of us enjoyed playing with action figures and making up stories. \n\nI'm sensing a lot of frustration & combativeness in your post (but I'm also assuming you're a teenager & that's kind of par for course, especially on recurring problems) -- can I ask about/suggest a different approach? Rather than making disparaging comments to your parents about how much you don't care about XYZ, is there anything you like enough to gush about or excitedly share info/details on an interest with your family? Or could you find an ally with your sibling(s) (e.g., get your siblings to share an interest with you & then expand it to a family thing)? People who are borderline obsessive about hobbies tend to understand & respond to excitement better than put downs. \n\nOr is there a way you can find an intersection between your siblings/parents interests and yours? I know my outdoorsy friends have compromised with other friends/partners about visiting National Parks by promising, \"Okay, we'll do this together because the sights are incredible, and I promise you can take lots of pictures your Instagram stories without any snarky commentary from me. And since you're willing to eat camping food for a few days, I'm willing to let you choose restaurants on the drive that meet your foodie tastes.\" \n\nTo be clear, you don't have to do this and some families are plain unreasonable/don't listen. But it's worth a shot if you're trying to change the dynamic so that it's not just y'all yelling at one another. Also, if it doesn't work -- fine, this is still a good skill to develop for your future relationships with friends/co-workers/neighbors/etc. You shouldn't have to teach your parents about mature communication & compromise/openness to other people's interests, but that's where we're at.",

They also know I like board games, baking, various other fandoms, and my career, and, likewise, I know at least a bit about their interests no matter how much or how little they overlap with my own.\n\nI am an *enormous* HP nerd, but folks who build their whole identity around a fandom really freak me out.
