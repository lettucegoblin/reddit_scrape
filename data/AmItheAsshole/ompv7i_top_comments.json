She should be upset with her family for treating you this way! </p>\n\n<p>There are the immediate issues with Daniel and you, but what if you have children with your fianc\u00e9e? MIL\u2019s behavior may go to a totally different level. </p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, it would be good for Daniel to have space from fianc\u00e9e and her family. Stealing his diary is a huge violation and if the topic is being discussed in front of him, it would be very upsetting. If you haven\u2019t already, sit down and explain to him that what she did was not OK. He knows this but it is very important he hears it from you.</p>\n</div>",

If OP's fiance picks up on her mother's behavior or just plain out repeats her pattern of obvious disinterest and neglect it will only make OP's son harder than it already is. 2 years is already not a long time for a kid to process something major as a death of a parent, let alone a new parent he might feel is trying to replace his mother (whether that's the case or not).

Act on this, and don't listen if they call you dramatic. Of course they are, people don't like being called out. It's way easier to turn it against others and sweep it under the rug. \nAlso, don't reconcile with her parents. The wedding will be terrible no matter what. If you give in, your son will feel betrayed by the only parent he has left, you will most likely be tense and annoyed at their presence, the parents will most likely pick on the wedding and your son, and your wife will most likely be either rug sweeping the entire church under her rug, faking a smile and saying nothing is wrong, or doing the opposite and blowing it all up. \n\nThink hard OP.

It&#39;s way easier to turn it against others and sweep it under the rug. \nAlso, don&#39;t reconcile with her parents. The wedding will be terrible no matter what. If you give in, your son will feel betrayed by the only parent he has left, you will most likely be tense and annoyed at their presence, the parents will most likely pick on the wedding and your son, and your wife will most likely be either rug sweeping the entire church under her rug, faking a smile and saying nothing is wrong, or doing the opposite and blowing it all up. </p>\n\n<p>Think hard OP. This is a really bad territory you&#39;re getting yourself into. Not just for you, but for your son and your sanity as well.</p>\n</div>",

He lost his mother at a young age and didn&#39;t really have a mother figure in years. he loves my fianc\u00e9e but doesn&#39;t see her as a mother to him and my fianc\u00e9e understands that. But my MIL is the source of all of our headache. Seeing how she treats her 2 granddaughters, I have no doubt that she is controlling and knows no boundaries.</p>\n</div>",

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You really should read the Rock the Boat essay. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">link to original</a></p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t rock the boat.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren&#39;t the ones rocking the boat. It&#39;s the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.</p>\n\n<p>At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.</p>\n\n<p>The boat-rocker can&#39;t survive in a boat by herself. She&#39;s never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She&#39;ll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.</p>\n\n<p>The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can&#39;t manage alone, but can&#39;t let the boat tip.

It's like an alternate universe.\n\nFor the love of all that's holy, don't have ~~kids~~ hostages with this woman, if you both want kids together, or marry this woman or join your finances any more than they are already.  This relationship has some serious issues which may doom it.  Last thing you want is to be stuck dealing with this clusterfuck at a kid's graduation, wedding, dance recitals, sports games, etc.  And if you're divorced, she can pretty much give her parents unfettered access to the ~~kid(s)~~ hostage(s).\n\nUntil you have decisively broken up, wear condoms.   If you don't want any more kids, consider a vasectomy.  Last thing you need is an 18-22 year sentence to this shitshow.",

Two grandparents of mine died before I was born, my grandmother died when I was 9 and my mother was estranged from her father, so I met the man a handful of times.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted grandparents, but we agreed on Grandma and Grandpa First initial of last name for my stepmom&#39;s parents.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you were widowed makes that an even more sensitive area and should be handled with even greater care.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are  shit stirrers.  They need the attention on themselves and negative attention is better than none.  Sounds like that might be her.  You&#39;re not going to change her, nor can your fiancee.  You can&#39;t change your fiancee.  All you can do is protect yourself and your son.</p>\n\n<p>Normal rules don&#39;t apply with people like your MIL and her family.  It&#39;s like an alternate universe.</p>\n\n<p>For the love of all that&#39;s holy, don&#39;t have <del>kids</del> hostages with this woman, if you both want kids together, or marry this woman or join your finances any more than they are already.  This relationship has some serious issues which may doom it.  Last thing you want is to be stuck dealing with this clusterfuck at a kid&#39;s graduation, wedding, dance recitals, sports games, etc.  And if you&#39;re divorced, she can pretty much give her parents unfettered access to the <del>kid(s)</del> hostage(s).</p>\n\n<p>Until you have decisively broken up, wear condoms.   If you don&#39;t want any more kids, consider a vasectomy.  Last thing you need is an 18-22 year sentence to this shitshow.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "> they tried to justify her behavior and say that my reaction was extreme\n\nThe gall of these people. How dare they call your reaction extreme, when the action she did was nuclear? Theft of a person's private thoughts, let alone the property that contains them. Absolutely unconscionable. To defend it is just disgusting. You are absolutely justified in banning her. Of course you would protect you and yours from crooks and violators. For them to try to make *you apologize* for that is just psychopathic.\n\nCan we examine that psychopathy for a sec? MIL is a thief, a step above a liar. She has no credibility. You cannot believe a word she says about her motivations for doing what she did. She didn't steal the journal to get to know your son better to improve their relationship, that's a lie and a sickening half-truth, and I'll tell you why. \n\nMIL is a narcissist of the highest order; what reasonable person would ever take this approach to \"getting to know someone\"? If someone doesn't want to be known, that's their right, and any reasonable person would see that, shrug, and move on. So why is MIL so fixated on this? Narcissists want control of everyone they can get their hands on, especially those they see as beneath them, like a teenager for instance. They thrive on interfering with other people's lives. If you are a reasonable person, you will have a reasonable person's bias, and it would never occur to you that this is a thing. It's part of how they manage to do what they do and for so long.\n\nYour son is one of the few people that's succeeded in gaining boundaries with her. Boundaries are the best defence against narcissists. As a narcissist, she really doesn't like that. She has to have everyone bouncing to her tune, everyone under her control, and when she doesn't get her way, she will delve into heinous acts with zero remorse. In fact, she simply doesn't even experience remorse. The closest thing she experiences is the remorse for *herself* for getting caught. That's why you are getting such heat by the way.\n\nSo why did she steal the journal? To get dirt on your son. To be able blackmail him with his own intimate thoughts. The \"getting to know\" your son was not for bettering their relationship, but for control. To manipulate your son for whatever narcissistic reason she pleases. But why? Likely in the beginning it is just simply the satisfaction of knowing she *has* the control. In the future, she will use control for any purpose she wants, so she can get her way. She's amassing a little army.\n\nHow can you know this is about control? *She and her conscripts are already on an overboard battle with you for control right now.* She is trying to control your own house, using her existing army. Don't give in, it isn't worth it. Protect yourself and your son and get as far away from this as possible. The odds of fixing a narcissist, especially an elder one whose brain is no longer malleable is an astronomically difficult task, and that's even if they want to change. \n\nStick to your guns on this, you are right, and the actions you took were correct. If you stay in the relationship with your finance, do not budge an inch on MIL's ban, because she as a narcissist will take this as weakness, and use it as an invitation to do even worse things. If she continues to escalate, you may have to go no-contact with MIL, and your spouse needs to be in agreement with you on that. \n\nGood luck out there. If you've never dealt with a narcissist before, you need to be prepared.",

        "body": "What's to discuss?  Girlfriend's mom entered your house with a lie to carry out the premeditated theft of your son's journal.  A boy she's been bullying, she then lied about what she'd been doing.  She committed a crime against your son and a crime against you and her daughters hopes for marriage.  This type of behavior doesn't just stop after a conversation.  Honestly, the fact that she thinks she's owed one is as insane as the rest of it.  \n\nWhat awful machinations do you think she'd have carried out if she'd had time with that journal?  And this is before you even sealed the deal on your marriage.  Do you think her behavior will improve once you're in a legal contact with her daughter that'd cost you money/assets to break?\n\nPretty sure it's over, OP.  I'd like to think you know that, too, and that you came here only to hear from neutral outsiders to your situation because you're effectively being gaslighted by three adults and need your feelings validated.  What I'm afraid of is that you're still genuinely struggling because, yes, what a horrible thing it must be to lose your love and come so close and have invested so much time and energy into someone who's willing to let her mother tare you apart in the final hour of your courtship.  It's awful. For you, for your son, for your finances in the likely event fiances' mom only gets worse once you're in LEGAL contract with her daughter, etc. \n\nYou need to remain resolute and become comfortable with what walking away looks like.\n\nIf you're desperate to accumulate more evidence you're on solid ground and to truly impress upon everyone your requirements & priorities & you think it won't simply offer them the chance they need to wear you down and manipulate you: present your own ultimatum.  Push the wedding date back a year.  What's the rush, really?  Make it contingent on your expectations that potential in-laws only interact with son when you're present and never at your home.  It's okay to need more time to evaluate and determine if going into contract with these people is the right move for you and yours.  Make them work for it or let them walk away if it's too much for them.\n\nHonestly, the more I think about the kind of insane steps you'll have to take to try and merge these families without compromising, missing something, etc it's really hard to picture how that stress won't destroy your marriage, in time.  Especially while the megalomaniac is always whispering into her daughters ear because the next project will be your entire world.\n\nAnd then what do you and your son have?  Alimony payments?  Will wife plan an \"unplanned\" pregnancy?  A rift between the two of you because you failed to do the basic arithmetic?\n\nOn the pregnancy note, OP, I'd URGE YOU TO NOT TAKE ANY ASSURANCES ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL FROM HERE ON OUT.  WHATEVER YOUR DESIGNS THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE PUT IN JEOPARDY IF SHE \"FORGETS.\"\n\nP.S.  get yourself some security cameras.  There are some out there that will send photographs of faces at entrances.  Not an uncommon feature.",

What I&#39;m afraid of is that you&#39;re still genuinely struggling because, yes, what a horrible thing it must be to lose your love and come so close and have invested so much time and energy into someone who&#39;s willing to let her mother tare you apart in the final hour of your courtship.  It&#39;s awful. For you, for your son, for your finances in the likely event fiances&#39; mom only gets worse once you&#39;re in LEGAL contract with her daughter, etc. </p>\n\n<p>You need to remain resolute and become comfortable with what walking away looks like.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re desperate to accumulate more evidence you&#39;re on solid ground and to truly impress upon everyone your requirements &amp; priorities &amp; you think it won&#39;t simply offer them the chance they need to wear you down and manipulate you: present your own ultimatum.  Push the wedding date back a year.  What&#39;s the rush, really?  Make it contingent on your expectations that potential in-laws only interact with son when you&#39;re present and never at your home.  It&#39;s okay to need more time to evaluate and determine if going into contract with these people is the right move for you and yours.  Make them work for it or let them walk away if it&#39;s too much for them.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, the more I think about the kind of insane steps you&#39;ll have to take to try and merge these families without compromising, missing something, etc it&#39;s really hard to picture how that stress won&#39;t destroy your marriage, in time.  Especially while the megalomaniac is always whispering into her daughters ear because the next project will be your entire world.</p>\n\n<p>And then what do you and your son have?  Alimony payments?  Will wife plan an &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancy?  A rift between the two of you because you failed to do the basic arithmetic?</p>\n\n<p>On the pregnancy note, OP, I&#39;d URGE YOU TO NOT TAKE ANY ASSURANCES ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL FROM HERE ON OUT.  WHATEVER YOUR DESIGNS THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE PUT IN JEOPARDY IF SHE &quot;FORGETS.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>P.S.  get yourself some security cameras.  There are some out there that will send photographs of faces at entrances.  Not an uncommon feature.</p>\n</div>",

Your fianc\u00e9e has some serious explaining to do regarding her enabling of her mother's invasion of your son's privacy. This is huge. If you marry her without resolving this issue, you're in for a life of misery and resentment from your son. He will see you as unwilling to protect him by allowing this family into his life. I, personally, would not allow that. My child is my #1 priority, and anyone who told me to get over it, or that I'm overreacting would be kicked to the curb.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Dude, your fianc\u00e9e let her mother into your home and <em>somehow</em> that woman found her way into your son&#39;s bedroom where she stuffed his journal into her purse. </p>\n\n<p>Now, like others have noted, how is it that she was able to get up to his room and find it? Your fianc\u00e9e has some serious explaining to do regarding her enabling of her mother&#39;s invasion of your son&#39;s privacy. This is huge. If you marry her without resolving this issue, you&#39;re in for a life of misery and resentment from your son. He will see you as unwilling to protect him by allowing this family into his life. I, personally, would not allow that. My child is my #1 priority, and anyone who told me to get over it, or that I&#39;m overreacting would be kicked to the curb.

The question is if those boundaries are compatible with a relationship with your fiance. They may or may not be. You may have to choose. It's horrible, I know.\n\nYou are asking your fiance to live a life in which she may never be able to have her mother visit her in her own home. You are asking her to not have her own parents at her own wedding.\n\nRegardless of how horrible the MIL is, she's still your fiance's mother. I doubt your fiance grew up hoping one day she would get married without her parents there to see her. Or that she would live out her life without her mother being able to visit her, or see and take care of future children.\n\nMerging families requires merging boundaries and they ARE going to clash.\n\nWhat ideally needs to happen is that you and your fiance together set boundaries for your new home and family. As long as the boundary in your home is set by you and you alone, you're creating a barrier in the relationship and making people (including yourself) pick sides. As a couple, you need to be united, so these boundaries and rules need to be owned by and enforced by both of you. You need your fiance on your side.\n\nThe real trouble here is that your fiance likely needs to establish boundaries with her mother that she should have set years ago and which are going to be painful for your fiance to set. She will need your support (if not also therapy) to do so. By doing so unilaterally, you're forcing your fiance to do personal development work she may not be ready to do.\n\nI recommend start with your fiance by talking about what sort of future boundaries both of you want.

        "body": "Reminds me of the rock the boat essay. \n\nCopy of rock the boat essay\n\n\n\n[Essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)\n\nDon't rock the boat. \n\nI've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own. \n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking. \n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\nBallast!\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Reminds me of the rock the boat essay. </p>\n\n<p>Copy of rock the boat essay</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/\">Essay</a></p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t rock the boat. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren&#39;t the ones rocking the boat. It&#39;s the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.</p>\n\n<p>At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own. </p>\n\n<p>The boat-rocker can&#39;t survive in a boat by herself. She&#39;s never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She&#39;ll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking. </p>\n\n<p>The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can&#39;t manage alone, but can&#39;t let the boat tip. After all, he&#39;s the best boat-steadier ever, and that can&#39;t be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can&#39;t capsize. How can they fix the situation?</p>\n\n<p>Ballast!</p>\n\n<p>And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.</p>\n\n<p>A born boat-steadier doesn&#39;t know what solid ground feels like. He&#39;s so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he&#39;ll fall over. There&#39;s a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He&#39;ll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .</p>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re in their boat, you&#39;re expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don&#39;t see that you aren&#39;t the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can&#39;t be allowed to tip, and you&#39;re not helping.</p>\n\n<p>Now you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. </p>\n\n<p>While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They&#39;re getting splashed! Somebody do something! </p>\n\n<p>So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can&#39;t you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.</p>\n\n<p>You know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the b**** overboard.</p>\n</div>",

As long as OP wasn't getting physical with the MIL, fiancee should have been backing OP.\n\nInstead, she blames OP for the situation.  MIL lost visiting privileges  when she pulled that stunt.  Fiancee  is so in the FOG (Fear, Obligation and Guilt) that she thinks OP and his son should have to put up with a woman who will invade the son's privacy, sneak into his room and steal his personal and private things.\n\nShe wants mother/daughter bonding with MIL, she can go to MIL's home or she can meet her out in public.\n\nFiancee also fails to defend OP against abuse allegations.  And she's joining in with the attempted guilt trip.\n\nFrankly, it sounds like she needs some intense and extended therapy before she has any business getting married and being a stepmother.  And I say that as someone who spent years going for weekly therapy to sort my own damage out.\n\nCouples therapy would be a good idea as well.  She needs an objective viewpoint on how fucked up her family's behavior is.  \n\n\nI think they need to postpone the wedding, go back to individual households and not have kids or combine finances again until the fiancee can disentangle herself from her parents.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The fiancee failed to protect Daniel.</p>\n\n<p>And she didn&#39;t just passively fail.

I think thats the why of it anyway.\n\nSo he started making up stuff not just about himself, but about me too, and trying to put me down with his lies, I called him out on it, and told him to stop or we'd have problems, he didn't I called him out infront of everyone a 2nd time and said stop, and he said he would again, but didn't. so I kicked him out of my life, and made it clear to the others he wasn't welcome... but they all acted like I was the bad guy for not tolerating his shit, because to them there was no difference between one day and the next, between one lie and the next.\n\nended cutting them all out, the way I saw it, he was trying to self preserve his identity and was in a survival mode. but they could have helped him if they saw him as a friend, and called him on his shit for once, and maybe over time he'd stop, by tolerating it, they are enabling him.\n\nalso as for your mother, stress comes from two incompatible conflicting ideas in our head at the same time, and that causing discomfort as we try decide between the two. your mom getting upset is almost a good sign, it means your opinion carries weight and she is listening, she hasn't started dismissing your opinion yet, but if your brother continues to enable her, she may see that as validation you are wrong and she is right, you need to get him on side, and be clear that him enabling her, is not an act of kindness and can do long term harm.\n\n\nafter my dad died, my mom went a bit crazy, or maybe she was always crazy and my dad kept it in check. anyway I fought with her a lot and I asked my brother for an opinion once, in case I was wrong, before reddit and sub's like this could give a neutral perspective.\n\nanyway he said I was right and she needed to be talked to, when we talked to her, she cried, he changed sides purely because of that, and made me look like the bad guy, she doubled down on her crazy and magnified her behaviour, and spiralled out of control.

NTA, but MIL and fiance are definitely TA.\n\nThe son has graciously accepted this new addition into his life and given his father his cooperation after losing his mother/been mature enough in watching his dad heal with someone else, and this woman wants to play therapist...and the wife doesn't seem to take issue with it or tell her to stay in her lane.\n\nMIL's gone so far as to *invade the privacy of a room and steal property FROM A TEENAGER* ***and fiance is insinuating that it's extreme to ban her from the house***. She's not even offering to speak to/stand up for son in any way. It's like it's a non-issue. This girl lives in the upside-down.\n\nImagine if the mother felt this way about OP and just felt like snooping his phone to figure him out!!! Fiance sounds infuriatingly passive. Past due to unlatch herself from mommy's tit.\n\nWhen you marry someone with kids, you're accepting to marry into a family unit. Even if she's not his mother, she has a duty to protect that which her spouse cherishes, even if she have no domain over it.\n\nI feel bad for son's bullying, but so, so happy that he has a dad that is relentless in his protection. Amazing and admirable, OP--but I definitely fear for your relationship.",

NTA, but MIL and fiance are definitely TA.</p>\n\n<p>The son has graciously accepted this new addition into his life and given his father his cooperation after losing his mother/been mature enough in watching his dad heal with someone else, and this woman wants to play therapist...and the wife doesn&#39;t seem to take issue with it or tell her to stay in her lane.</p>\n\n<p>MIL&#39;s gone so far as to <em>invade the privacy of a room and steal property FROM A TEENAGER</em> <strong><em>and fiance is insinuating that it&#39;s extreme to ban her from the house</em></strong>. She&#39;s not even offering to speak to/stand up for son in any way. It&#39;s like it&#39;s a non-issue. This girl lives in the upside-down.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if the mother felt this way about OP and just felt like snooping his phone to figure him out!!! Fiance sounds infuriatingly passive. Past due to unlatch herself from mommy&#39;s tit.</p>\n\n<p>When you marry someone with kids, you&#39;re accepting to marry into a family unit. Even if she&#39;s not his mother, she has a duty to protect that which her spouse cherishes, even if she have no domain over it.</p>\n\n<p>I feel bad for son&#39;s bullying, but so, so happy that he has a dad that is relentless in his protection. Amazing and admirable, OP--but I definitely fear for your relationship.</p>\n</div>",
