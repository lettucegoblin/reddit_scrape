        "body": "OP, I want to share a story with you and I hope you can get something out of it. If not, that\u2019s totally cool, too. \n\nMy mom used to get terribly restless legs. On December 23, 2011, she had them worse than ever. She was walking, jogging, doing jumping jacks and stretches, everything she could think of to make her legs stop jittering. Her last resort was to go for a quick drive because the vibrations of the car seemingly helped her. She asked me if I wanted to go with her, but I was playing my favorite game over Christmas break, and wanted to play more. I was 12 - more than capable of being left home alone while dad was at work. The instant I told her \u201cno\u201d I had this huge, strong sensation that something was wrong. It was the first time I\u2019d felt something like that and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I did nothing, and my mom left. \n\nShe ended up sliding into the oncoming lane and wrecked on a bridge. She doesn\u2019t remember it happening and the official report was that she fell asleep at the wheel. Both cars spiraled and then rolled off the bridge. There was a family with a 3 year old in the other car. My mom shattered her calcaneus and lost her left index and the first part of her left middle finger. The other family was significantly worse. Fortunately, my mom is still here. But I blamed myself and sometimes still do blame myself for not going with her. When my dad and I went to the impound lot to get stuff out of the completely totaled vehicle, we saw what would\u2019ve happened. \n\nThe truck didn\u2019t roll longways - it went bed over engine and rolled that way down the culvert. The truck stopped when the roof of the truck hit a tree and essentially wrapped around the tree. And where the truck had been smashed in is exactly where I would\u2019ve been sitting if I\u2019d been in the truck. I mean that the roof was touching the center console and the seatbelt lock on the passenger side. And somehow I still wished I\u2019d been in the truck. Maybe, if she did fall asleep, I could\u2019ve steered us away. Maybe I would\u2019ve died. Maybe I could\u2019ve saved my mom\u2019s fingers. Maybe my family wouldn\u2019t have spent Christmas in the hospital with her. \n\nMy parents quickly put me in therapy. The therapist taught me something that I still struggle with: a child should never be expected to save their parents. I\u2019m gonna repeat that for you: **a child should never be expected to save their parents.** \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve thought about the crash a million different ways and a billion different times. I know I did, and I wasn\u2019t even a part of it. I won\u2019t tell you to look at things another way because I doubt there\u2019s an angle you haven\u2019t seen this from. \n\nBut the other commenters are right, and I wonder if it touches on something else: your mother didn\u2019t want to pay for an ambulance, so she definitely has some culpability in this too, but I think she knows that. I think she finds it easier to blame you than herself because she knows she\u2019s actually the one who did it. Does that excuse or justify her behavior? Not in the damn slightest. You both should\u2019ve been in therapy as soon as it was possible. She decided she was going to project her pain onto you and that is beyond messed up. She abused you because it was easier than abusing herself. But once again, *a child should never be expected to save their parents* and you should never have been put in the position you were. \n\nThe 10-year anniversary of my mom\u2019s crash is this year. Some days I blame myself, some days I don\u2019t. The one thing that I hold on to is that my mom didn\u2019t blame me. Your dad doesn\u2019t blame you, either. I just knew that at some point, it had to be time to save myself from my own mental and emotional torture. I hope you see that this is that time for you. I genuinely hope you get some professional help. I hope you can look back one day, years from now, and be able to forgive yourself, even if partially. And I hope you never, ever go near your mother again. She will undermine every bit of progress you fight for. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need anything from me. I also understand if you need or want nothing, or if you get nothing from this. \n\n**You deserve peace.**",

I also understand if you need or want nothing, or if you get nothing from this. </p>\n\n<p><strong>You deserve peace.</strong></p>\n</div>",

Maybe if she cared about you more, she wouldn&#39;t have gotten yelled at by her parents. </p>\n\n<p>How dare your mother treat you this way. Everything, absolutely everything you spoke about in your post is her fault. She is a monster. You did nothing wrong. Let her go, and focus on your life.

Probably not. Because it&#39;s no ones fault. </p>\n\n<p>Stay with your grandparents, stay far far away from your mother and step father. They are not out for your best interest. Good luck with everything. Sending lots of love.</p>\n</div>",

When you told them how their daughter was behaving, they immediately came over to her house. Your grandmother screamed at her daughter (aka your Mom) about the rotten way she was behaving. In fact, your grandmother and grandfather (your Mom's Mom and Dad) removed you from her control because of the abusive, horrible, terrible way she was treating you. Your grandparents removed you from their daughter's house. Think about that. Your Mom's father and mother were so upset at the way their daughter behaved, they found it absolutely essential to IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY (they packed all your stuff) remove you from their daughter's house. This is serious. This is your grandparents letting you know that how she treated you was so wrong that they found nothing less than removing you from her house would suffice.\n\nYour father absolutely loved you. Someone who loves you would NEVER want you to feel guilty or responsible for an accident. It would break your father's heart to think that you are carrying this burden around. It's time to put it down. It was never yours to bear and you aren't responsible for what happened. Children at 5 think they are responsible for everything that happens because they think they have that power (kind of like believing in superpowers or magic) \u2014 but that's just not true. Growing up means understanding that. It means understanding that you don't have total power & control over the world \u2014 whether it's over good things or terrible ones. You only have control over how you react to the situation.\n\nI know you are concerned about money.

My dad died when I was 5, driving me to the hospital (Mom didn't want to pay for an ambulance). He died in the crash and my leg and spine got busted up in a way that has left me needing a cane pretty much ever since. \n\nMy step-dad's always been a little distant with me, he likes to make jokes about how I'm an 'early blooming black widow'. I think he gets that from my mom, who blames me for my dad's death. I do to, it *is* my fault after all, so I don't push back on it. Anyway, the point is that with the current situation my parents are always looking for ways to get my half siblings active and doing things without leaving the house, and have recently settled on scavenger hunts.\n\nI have no problem with this honestly. I wish they'd stop hiding stuff in my underwear drawer, but it's a 5 y0 and a 7 yo so that's not the worst. My *problem* though is that they keep taking my cane when I'm not looking (I tend to get lost in my homework and my writing hobby and zone out) and having it be one of the items that my half siblings have to find. When I complain to my step-dad (he's a SAHD so is usually the one running these things) he scolds me for being selfish and points out that my swivel chair has wheels if I need the bathroom and that they always get it to me before I have to go downstairs for dinner.\n\nI tried my mom yesterday, and she said that I was being a brat and that if I wanted a father who cared about me I shouldn't have killed my dad. I got really upset at that point and called my grandparents (my mom's parents, Dad's are dead too). They showed up at 10 PM yesterday, and Grandma screamed at them while Grandpa packed my stuff up and helped me out to their car.\n\nMy mom's been blowing up my phone and email, calling me all sorts of names and accusing me of turning her family against her and trying to get her in legal trouble since minors can't move out. And I can't help but think that maybe she's right so...AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019ve had two 5 year olds, and they were so fearless and unaware of the consequences to dangerous behavior. You had no idea you would get hurt jumping off the stairs. You also didn\u2019t know going to the hospital would cause an accident causing you to lose your father.\n\nYour mother on the other hand sounds like one of the biggest AHs ever. She\u2019s the one who chose to marry someone who wouldn\u2019t treat you with love and kindness. When I remarried, I made sure my husband would treat my kids like his own, and he does.

It truly astounds me that people think it is ok to take someone\u2019s medical device and play games with it. It is callous, it is disrespectful, and just so so harmful.\n\nBut it\u2019s so concerning to see that you blame yourself for what happened to your dad. Look, I\u2019m 20F, so I\u2019m not that much older than you. Please try to understand that what I\u2019m saying comes from an older sister who does not know your pain, but is very concerned about you. *You are blameless*. \n\nYes, you launched yourself down the stairs so you could fly. Yes, you needed medical attention. Yes, your dad drove you there, and yes he was in an accident because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That doesn\u2019t mean that you are to blame, and it\u2019s truly sad that your mom chose that to shift blame on you. The only thing to blame for his death is the reason why the accident happened in the first place. Now don\u2019t say that you are that reason because you are absolutely not. I don\u2019t know how the accident happened or anything, but I do know this: no matter the way the accident happened, you are *never* to blame. You are not the driver of the car that may have crashed into him, you are not what caused the brakes to fail if that was what happened, you are not the other car that maybe made your dad swerve, you are not the snow or ice or rain that might\u2019ve made the car slide and crash, etc. No matter the situation, you are NEVER what made the car crash. \n\nNow I know you might say to that, well I was the reason my dad was there. That\u2019s still not valid though. The reason why your dad was there at the scene of the accident was not because he was driving you, because honestly the both of you could\u2019ve been anywhere without getting into an accident. Again, I don\u2019t know the circumstances, but the reasons why your dad was at that place at that time depends on when the he left the house, the route he took, how fast he was going, the road, the stop signs, the signals, the other cars around him, and by default, the times the drivers of the OTHER cars left their houses and the routes they took and everything else along the way. Can we reasonably blame ALL of them? \n\nAnd this brings me to my next point. Why must we play the blame game for everything? This kind of situation is not one where you should be assigned blame, it\u2019s one where you should be shown love, compassion, kindness, and support. Anyone who behaves otherwise is a horrific, abusive asshole, and that includes your mom and your stepfather. The blame game accomplishes NOTHING. Does it make the pain your dad\u2019s death go away? NO. Does it erase the accident? NO. It does not accomplish ANYTHING productive. Instead, it makes you feel worse and worse about yourself and makes you incapable of moving on. So even if your mother decides to keep playing this game, it would be in your best interest to not participate in it at all. \n\n\nI\u2019ll give you something that happened to an acquaintance in high school. His mom was driving him to his job at a grocery store when a bus whose brakes weren\u2019t working t-boned the car and killed his mother. My acquaintance had his license and he had a car. He could\u2019ve gone by himself. By all means, the mother had no reason to be there at that time, but she was because she was driving him. Let me tell you, NO ONE felt that he was at fault for his mother\u2019s death. The real cause was the bus driver\u2019s irresponsibility in fixing the brakes, which he went to prison for. What do you feel about this situation? \n\nI hope I\u2019m not coming off too harsh. Your mother\u2019s abusive guilt tripping and emotional blackmail is intolerable, and you never deserve that. It angers me that your mother has treated you in such a way for the past 12 years to make you think you are to blame and make it hard for you to believe otherwise. I hope you\u2019re opening up to this idea more as you read the replies because I\u2019m sure everyone is saying the same thing. Please feel free to PM me.",

You were a child when the accident with your father happened; in no way shape or form was it your fault. It does not matter WHY your father was driving at that time unless you grabbed the steering wheel and pulled him off course there is no way you caused the accident.

Because I know with every fiber of my being that it wasn't. And when, eventually, she gcame up with that idea herself, that said failed relationship was her fault - I very quickly and very seriously explained to her why it wasn't in a way she could understand at the time.\n\nWhat your mother did and does, however, is the very opposite. She's projecting her own guilt on you. If someone could be blamed for your father's dead and your disability, it's your mom for being stingy and not calling an ambulance. I still wouldn't blame her for the resulting accident, but as an ADULT, she should have been able to gauge the risk of something going wrong. She also should have been able to tell that, with certain injuries (which you had), it's incredibly important to get professional help before moving the victim - meaning you. Because one wrong move can mean the difference between a full recovery and life in a wheelchair. But, apparently, she was willing to risk that, too.\n\nYou, however, were a little child. Look at your half-siblings. Do they act rationally all the time? No? Guess why? Because they literally CAN'T. The same was true for five-year-old you. It's not your fault for being a kid. Because you WERE a kid. And you sure as heck couldn't fathom the possible consequences as a wisp of a little girl.\n\nThe way your mother is treating you is truly abhorrent and, yes, abusive. And, as many others have pointed out, your grandparents' reaction is proof of it. They didn't defend your mother one bit, didn't take their side or even let her say her piece. Because what she did and does to you is unredeemable. There's nothing, absolutely nothing that can excuse her treatment of you. Because, let's be honest, she's being cruel to you, and has been for at least 12 years. She literally risked your health with that stunt of not calling an ambulance. And she actually condones the behavior of the rest of your family that very clearly hurts you and deprives you of basic human freedoms. Like the freedom to move where you want (within reason). Trust your grandparents, and trust their judgement.\n\nAlso, I saw in a comment that your grandparents had no idea you mother blamed you for your father's dead until you called them.

I'm the daughter of a child psychologist and a professor of child development- between them they had more than 70 years of teaching before they retired. I studied child development at university and I volunteer with kids with cognitive delays and disabilities. Can you accept that I might have a background in how kids think?\n\nAt five, children DO NOT have the physical OR cognitive development to gauge risk. The PHYSICAL parts of your brain that do 'abstract risk analysis' literally have NOT developed. They aren't there. That's why, after being told 439 times 'don't touch the stove, it's hot', kids still do it - until they're burned, it's abstract, and while they can LEARN 'don't do what I'm told not to', that's following instructions, not making a judgement call.\n\nOn top of that, kids don't have a good cognitive (reasoning/thinking) understanding of the difference between 'reality' and 'fantasy'. This is NORMAL. Because kids' worlds are limited to what they've experienced, anything they hear about/see in books/tv/games/ etc. is POSSIBLE - after all, it's being shown to them, isn't it? Pretending to BE the characters is not only normal, it's IMPORTANT - 'hero play' is an essential part of how kids determine 'good and bad' or 'right and wrong' - it's stepping into the shoes of someone who embodies behaviours that we want kids to learn ... how to be good people.\n\nFor a five year old, assuming the costume would let you fly is INCREDIBLY normal - it's standard behaviour. I'd be willing to bet that half the people on this thread did it - I did. Now, I did it by jumping off a dock, not off stairs, so my landing was probably softer - but then, I couldn't swim, so it was also riskier. My dad ruined a brand new pair of custom shoes (he has special orthotics and they used to have to be built into shoes - they were hundreds of dollars a pair, and this was almost 40 years ago), and a brand new camera with telephoto lense that I know (now) my mom saved up for a YEAR to buy. Oh, and he lost his glasses, which meant he was blind as a bat and those weren't cheap either. All in all, I figure that stunt probably cost my parents a year's worth of personal disposable income. But I don't know that for certain because THEY NEVER BLAMED ME. They recognised that I was FIVE, I was acting like a FIVE YEAR OLD and that while I had made a lousy choice, it was an ENTIRELY predictable kid choice, and they should have been keeping an eye on me (my dad was taking photos of a sunset, and my mom was nursing my incredibly fussy eight-month old sibling). There were consequences for me - I had disobeyed them (I seem to remember arguing that I didn't deserve them because they said \"don't go in the water\" and I hadn't MEANT to go in the water, I had meant to fly over it...), but I wasn't punished for damaging my dad's stuff; the consequences were the 'usual ones' for disobeying an instruction ... I want to say I lost dessert for the rest of the trip and no treats at the store for two weeks? That sounds about right.\n\nOP, you are not responsible for what happened to your dad. It's a tragedy, and it's horrible, and it's incredibly unfair, BUT YOU DIDN'T CAUSE IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nOP, you need to have a conversation with your grandparents, and I want you to ask them to find you a Psychologist, or a Councillor. You have had TWELVE YEARS of lies poured into you, twelve years of guilt and blame and anger directed to you, and you need to work with a professional to learn how to counteract that. Your mother is WRONG - and honestly, I don't care at this point about her feelings, her guilt, her whatever the F\\*&\\^ she was feeling: SHE ABUSED YOU by making you feel like this was your fault and you need professional assistance to help you grow from this. What your mother did was WRONG, more, it was EVIL (and I don't use that word lightly): She forced something on you that was never yours and used it to hurt you.\n\nOP, you're NTA ; but more importantly, OP, you're NOT AT FAULT - not for any of it. You need to find a professional to help you rewire these paths your mom has laid down - the ones that say \"I did this horrible thing and because of that I deserve to be treated the way I am\" - they're wrong, and dangerous and damaging you.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: So, uh... this kinda blew up? I've never had a comment do this, and I'm not sure what to say, aside from a)OP, I hope that all these people who are liking/awarding this re-enforces what I'm saying: that you are NOT responsible, and that you COULD NOT be responsible, and that what your mother has done is wrong. and b) Thank you all who have upvoted or awarded this... you made my day, if not my month!",

I would try to barter with the tooth fairy to get more money, I once wrote a letter and slept with it believing that fairies will read it and befriend me thanks to a book I read, and I spent like a year praying every night to develop wings.

Your ability to get around is lower on her/your stepdad\u2019s list of priorities than a game: let that sink in.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP, but this whole situation should show you exactly where you fit into their life. This isn\u2019t love, this is a toxic relationship. You blame yourself for your father\u2019s death because she\u2019s told you to, not because you are to blame. You hear the voice that tells you it\u2019s your fault in your own voice but the words and guilt associated with them belong to her, not you.

So not only is she feeding you lies about your dad, she\u2019s okay with you not being able to get around because your stepdad has decided that your siblings need your cane more than you do in order to play a game. Your ability to get around is lower on her/your stepdad\u2019s list of priorities than a game: let that sink in.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sorry, OP, but this whole situation should show you exactly where you fit into their life. This isn\u2019t love, this is a toxic relationship. You blame yourself for your father\u2019s death because she\u2019s told you to, not because you are to blame. You hear the voice that tells you it\u2019s your fault in your own voice but the words and guilt associated with them belong to her, not you. I highly encourage you to work with a therapist on this because that is a LOT to put on someone your age \u2014 and it was awful parenting on her part to do so. NTA.</p>\n</div>",

This woman started the whole thing by denying her injured child an ambulance  - I don\u2019t care how bad the family finances are, it\u2019s an injured child and you don\u2019t stop and think of money if you have any humanity - and forcing her husband to have to drive.  The fact he didn\u2019t override her says a lot about the family dynamic.\n\nThen she has spent over a decade blaming an innocent kid for everything, brainwashing them into carrying the guilt that is hers alone, and doubled down by encouraging her second husband and other children to torment and harangue her disabled daughter.  That puts her squarely into monster territory, in my book.  I believe she was a narcissistic monster who controlled the family before the accident and nothing has changed.\n\nOP needs to stay with the grandparents, who clearly do care, and recognise their own daughter for what she is.  They need to get legal custody.  They also need to get OP into therapy to begin to undo the appalling psychological damage her vile mother inflicted on her, so she can begin to have the life she deserves.  It would be worth also seeing if there are any further medical steps (surgery, rehab) that can help alleviate OP\u2019s physical condition, because I wouldn\u2019t put it past the mother to have refused her further treatment after the initial hospitalisation.",

The fact he didn\u2019t override her says a lot about the family dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>Then she has spent over a decade blaming an innocent kid for everything, brainwashing them into carrying the guilt that is hers alone, and doubled down by encouraging her second husband and other children to torment and harangue her disabled daughter.  That puts her squarely into monster territory, in my book.  I believe she was a narcissistic monster who controlled the family before the accident and nothing has changed.</p>\n\n<p>OP needs to stay with the grandparents, who clearly do care, and recognise their own daughter for what she is.  They need to get legal custody.  They also need to get OP into therapy to begin to undo the appalling psychological damage her vile mother inflicted on her, so she can begin to have the life she deserves.  It would be worth also seeing if there are any further medical steps (surgery, rehab) that can help alleviate OP\u2019s physical condition, because I wouldn\u2019t put it past the mother to have refused her further treatment after the initial hospitalisation.</p>\n</div>",

That will go a long way towards covering the costs of therapy. You just have to ask your primary doctor (the one you go to for checkups & shots & stuff) for a referral. I think the bulk of therapists in the state take Mainecare, so you'll have a bunch of options- even more so because everyone's doing video appointments right now, so you're not gonna be limited by distance.\n\nIf your doctor (and/or the therapist you pick out to go to) are part of the Northern Light Healthcare system, then you'll be able to see about using their sliding fee scale. Depending on how much your grandparents make in a year (I assume you're gonna be staying with them from now on, and I really hope you do) the health system will cover up to 100% of the costs (they have brackets and do it in increments of 10%, so if your grandparents make $x, they'll cover 10%, then 20%, etc). You do have to ask directly about it though, so have your grandparents ask the front office folks about it. They'll have the contact information for the financial folks.\n\nAlso, you of course know best about who you'd feel the most comfortable speaking with!! Don't be afraid to reach out to a few different folks. Sometimes it may take a few tries to find the person who makes you think \"yes. this person is going to be able to help me\". \n\nSorry for writing you a giant essay.
