        "body": "Ugh. I get so angry listening to my friend talk about how her ex treats their daughter. He used to be my best friend, but basically his divorce and all the dirty laundry that got aired out showed me who he truly is. \n\nHe moved cities just to avoid his kid as much as possible. He is constantly trying to weasel out of payments and visitation. \n\nShe is actually moving very close to where he is now. She predicts that he will move again within a year to avoid having to actually spend time with his kid without looking like a deadbeat. \n\nAnd I guess that is the worst part. He really is a deadbeat dad. He can't even keep his own daughter without staying at his parent's place on the random occasions that he does pick her up. \n\nBut despite all of that, my friend group sees him as the victim of her kicking him out. And he is so good at painting her as the villain for \"keeping his daughter from him\". She moved in with us for a few months during the first part of the covid quarantine.

Told me I could tell him what our son needed and he would buy that, but all the bills and food and healthcare and transportation and actual living expenses and associated costs were completely my responsibility, and regardless of the fact that I didn't buy a damn thing for myself for over a decade and a half he didn't want to \"fund my lavish lifestyle\". He wouldn't even let me give him receipts for things that were for our son, he wouldn't give me money, he wanted to go buy the stuff and have that be enough. It's just another avenue of bs control he wanted to exert on me. Like 40 dollars a week for just over a year when our son was 8 somehow makes me able to buy new gaming computers (nope), or be able to afford new bicycles and skateboards and sporting equipment each year (i have saved extensively to make some of those available, but I can't do it every time something is wanted) or send him to camps, or take vacations, or buy new jordans for a kid that outgrows shoes in 3 months. I was somehow wasteful, nevermind he didn't pay even 2% of our son's actual upkeep.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My son&#39;s father didn&#39;t take actual living expenses into account when deciding that I didn&#39;t spend enough on my son out of the pittance he paid for just over a year out of my sons now 15 years alive. Told me I could tell him what our son needed and he would buy that, but all the bills and food and healthcare and transportation and actual living expenses and associated costs were completely my responsibility, and regardless of the fact that I didn&#39;t buy a damn thing for myself for over a decade and a half he didn&#39;t want to &quot;fund my lavish lifestyle&quot;. He wouldn&#39;t even let me give him receipts for things that were for our son, he wouldn&#39;t give me money, he wanted to go buy the stuff and have that be enough. It&#39;s just another avenue of bs control he wanted to exert on me.

He pays the lowest amount allowed by law (about $100/kid/month) and is always either late or doesn't pay. He pays just often enough to keep himself out of jail. Most of his work is under the table, so it can't be used to raise his support. But he can somehow spend a couple hundred dollars on junk food and cheap plastic crap when he sees them. It would be infuriating if I still gave a darn. (\"I've No More Fucks To Give\" is my official theme song, lol.)\n\nUnfortunately, it would cost far more to take him to court than the children would gain from it. Fortunately, I can take care of them without counting on his CS. We'll never be rich, but we have what we need. And although I never criticize him to them, they are old enough to know the difference between his \"parenting\" and my parenting. \n\nIt's really concerning that OP's son is 17 and doesn't see who really cares about him. If he keeps following his dad's way of thinking, he's going to be a very unhappy adult and a huge asshole.",
