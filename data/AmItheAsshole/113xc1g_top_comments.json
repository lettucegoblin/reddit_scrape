Instead his parents traveled up to where his brothers and their families live, and invited me and our daughter up for the weekend with them. My ex husband was marrying my brothers ex wife (all ex because of their affair). That weekend will forever mean more to me than I can even express. I was so happy to be part of that family and I had grown so close to them over the years. I\u2019ll forever be amazed at their decision and thankful for them showing me support at that time. Good job to y\u2019all.</p>\n</div>",

That's life. \n\nSo you're not an asshole to help her out. That's nice of you. But again, I don't understand why you would ban his fiancee from your house. Because he cheated?! That's weird to me. Yes, cheating is terrible, we all agree. But shit happens...life happens, relationships break up. It seems odd to ruin your relationship with your son unless there was more to it than that. And \"out of respect for his ex-wife\" makes very little sense to me. She doesn't live there. \nThe presence of his fiance in your eyeline is an inherent show of disrespect for his ex, who is clearly more important to you than him - is what it sounds like.\n\nYou're strongly implying that he was a terrible guy. But the worst I can actually pin on him is that he was solely responsible for some of the negative events in the relationship. Of course he was. It'd be unbelievable if he wasn't. Oh, and he doesn't want to hear from one of his parents critiquing everything he did wrong in the relationship - that's also supposed to show how immature he is. But it also shows how overly-involved you are, I think.\n\n\nAnd that he reacted negatively to his fiance being banned and you turning your nose up at his wedding invitation. I don't think I'd react too positively to that, myself, tbh.\n\nHe's written here as selfish and immature. But I'm just having trouble piecing together in a concrete way, why that's *definitely* the case. And why you're siding with his ex so much at his expense. Again, great to help her out. But, when you're also avoiding his wedding and banning his fiance, you're clearly taking sides against your son and I'm not sure *exactly* why that is. \n\nAlso.... you raised the kid. Just something smacks really shitty about you hearing the ex's side and thinking \"well, I know what an AH my son is, so this must be true\".\nLike, I'm sure he is an asshole. A lot of dudes in their early 20s are very selfish in relationships. But it's weird to do this whole \"I'm going to cultivate a relationship with your ex-wife to replace the one I'm throwing away with you\".

I don't know how your relationship with your son was before he went off to college, and I don't know if there are other Missing Reasons connected to why he wanted to disconnect from you. The thing is, family isn't really the important factor here.\n\nYou knew an adult man who isolated his wife and abused her emotionally and financially. You disapproved of his actions. When he rushed into a new relationship before the ink was dry on the divorce request (within a timeframe that makes cheating a very real possibility), you communicated that you did not support the action and refused to attend the resulting wedding.\n\nDoes it really matter that he's your son in all this? I say no.\n\nTypically the abusive behaviour you see from toxic estranged parents is a refusal to stop treating their children like kids. But you are treating your son as an adult. Your reaction would be totally normal coming from a friend or coworker of his. Family is not a relevant factor.\n\nMaybe he was certain his dad would always be in his corner, but if that was an issue, he should have sat you down and talked to you about it. It doesn't sound like he did so. Even if he did, though, if you found this difference irreconcilable, then a separation makes sense. Make no mistake - with the refusal to attend the wedding, send a gift, or even pass along congratulations, you have effectively decided to disown your son. And that's fine. Breakups happen. They're not just for partnerships that don't work out. You are well within your rights to say \"this is spousal abuse, this is abominable treatment of the mother of my grandchildren, and I will not stand for it\".\n\nThe only *possible* issue is that, should your son repeat his pattern of behaviour with DIL #2, I don't see anyone well positioned to help her (or any future grandkids from that union).

I don&#39;t know how your relationship with your son was before he went off to college, and I don&#39;t know if there are other Missing Reasons connected to why he wanted to disconnect from you. The thing is, family isn&#39;t really the important factor here.</p>\n\n<p>You knew an adult man who isolated his wife and abused her emotionally and financially. You disapproved of his actions. When he rushed into a new relationship before the ink was dry on the divorce request (within a timeframe that makes cheating a very real possibility), you communicated that you did not support the action and refused to attend the resulting wedding.</p>\n\n<p>Does it really matter that he&#39;s your son in all this? I say no.</p>\n\n<p>Typically the abusive behaviour you see from toxic estranged parents is a refusal to stop treating their children like kids. But you are treating your son as an adult. Your reaction would be totally normal coming from a friend or coworker of his. Family is not a relevant factor.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe he was certain his dad would always be in his corner, but if that was an issue, he should have sat you down and talked to you about it. It doesn&#39;t sound like he did so. Even if he did, though, if you found this difference irreconcilable, then a separation makes sense. Make no mistake - with the refusal to attend the wedding, send a gift, or even pass along congratulations, you have effectively decided to disown your son. And that&#39;s fine. Breakups happen. They&#39;re not just for partnerships that don&#39;t work out. You are well within your rights to say &quot;this is spousal abuse, this is abominable treatment of the mother of my grandchildren, and I will not stand for it&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The only <em>possible</em> issue is that, should your son repeat his pattern of behaviour with DIL #2, I don&#39;t see anyone well positioned to help her (or any future grandkids from that union). That&#39;s unfortunate. It&#39;s also beyond your control.</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes and good luck to you and yours.</p>\n</div>",

My husband and I promised each other that divorce wasn\u2019t a word that would be used in our home. Ever. And it never has been.

We\u2019re human and live life differently and life events change us. The key is to grow towards each other when this happens. 2. Laugh together. No matter how tough life may be become, find humor in something, anything. Sometimes it can seems like there\u2019s nothing to laugh about but in those dark times, sometimes it\u2019ll be dark humor.

Oldest married a pyscho entitled whackjob that wore off on him so hard that when my mom called to tell him their father died he CHOSE to go to work bc 'oh well parents die'. Even his boss was shocked he came in that day. Many moons later when I was grown grandma got cancer. She already was living with my mom for years at this point. Mom was a CNA before her own health issues so she cared for her mom. I quit college and came home to help. Grandma had helped raise me. Her one motto she always made sure to drill into me was \"Kindness costs nothing\". She accepted all my friends. Black, white, gay, straight, you name it she was a grandma to them. Oldest brother and his wife shamed their youngest so far into the closet I'm amazed he didn't end up in Narnia. And when grandma was dying and the docs said gather the family they chose to DRIVE from Vegas to central Pennsylvania. Claimed there were no flights (I checked, there were 6). Grandma died and those ghouls wanted them to keep her body in the room until they got there... 3 hours later. Luckily the funeral director told him to pound sand. Well, we'd helped grandma with all her bills. Life insurance had enough to cover the funeral and about $2k left. He was the listened beneficiary bc grandma never got around to changing it. He never used that $2k toward grandma's final expenses like hospital bills so we ended up paying and begging for them to cancel things. Had he turned it over they'd have written most of it off but his wife saw $2k to play with at the casino... I screamed them out the house when they showed up the day after she passed. It was my gd birthday no less.\n\nSo the point? Parents can do their damnedest to raise good kids and end up with assholes in the mix. You did your best.",

Sure right now he doesn't seem interested in them but in the future he might become very interested and that's when new problems will begin.  Narcissists have this thing where they need their \"N supply\".   It means they draw a sick pleasure from emotional abuse.  Quite simply, it feeds into the deep insecurity which is the root of narcissism.  His ex was a good source until she wised up and left him.
