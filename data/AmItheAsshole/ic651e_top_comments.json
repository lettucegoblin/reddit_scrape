Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.\n\nAll of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .\n\nIn the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.\n\nFast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.\n\nSo my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.\n\nMy mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.\n\nMy friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Shake it and listen to your bf, who seems yo have your back. Your only realistic option to avoid serious issues later on, is to file a report of identity theft against them. Do it. You owe them nothing here, especially not your identity.</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019m assuming you can\u2019t pay for a lawyer, and there\u2019s probably no point suing your parents as they have no assets - but you need to block them from creating more debt in your name and potentially need to look at bankruptcy to sort out the existing debts. </p>\n\n<p>You may be at risk of far more than losing a tax return. If things are this bad YOU could get evicted and not be able to sign a new lease. </p>\n\n<p>If as a result of this being reported you parents end up charged and potentially sent to prison, you didn\u2019t cause this. They did. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a situation you can ignore and hope it will fix itself. You need to act yesterday, today is the next best option.</p>\n\n<p>NTA</p>\n</div>",

You would. \n\nYou are being victimized, and in a manner that will have long lasting consequences for your life *for decades to come*. You will have trouble renting apartments, buying cars, getting a mortgage, perhaps even getting a job as some require credit checks (government and finance mostly, but really could be any job). This will also impact any romantic relationships and legal marriages. \n\nWhat they are doing is fraud and identity theft. They need to go to jail because they are criminals. Yes, they are your parents..but as far as parents go, they are abusing and victimizing their own child. \n\n>My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens.\n\nThis is blatantly false. It is not her \"right\"..it's not even legal.  As for your duty, this is also false. You didn't create the burdens and you are not responsible for lifting them. None of this is of your own making. \n\nI strongly encourage you to report them criminally, and press charges. Very few victims of identity theft get the opportunity to put away their victimizer, so you are very lucky. What's more, I can promise you that you are not the only victims. They are victimizing businesses as well. You do have a duty to your society at large to report them, and to stop them. \n\nI have a few suggestions for IMMEDIATE actions:\n\nFREEZE your credit immediately!!!! You can do this through Experian or TransUnion, the main credit bureaus. You can freeze your credit for 6 months, and at the end of the 6 months, do it again if you need to. This will prevent anyone from making applications under your name for credit. Any applications will automatically be rejected due to the freeze, so this will prevent your parents from doing this behind your back. Keep in mind, this will also prevent YOU from applying for credit for that time period, so if you are planning on getting new cards, financing anything or getting a loan, then postpone it for now. \n\nGo to court and apply to have your name changed. Clearly, your parents are using a copy of your ID somewhere...you cannot just put a name down on a loan app without showing ID. Change your name and get new ID. This will also help reduce fallout from their bad loans and collections, but only a little as your SSN will be the same. This process takes longer, so freeze the credit first and then worry about changing your name. \n\nGather everything. Pay to run a credit check on yourself and go through it line by line, separating out everything you know you didn't apply for  yourself. This will help the lawsuit. \n\nConsider bankruptcy. You may still have to do this, even if you were the victim of ID theft. Fact is, bankruptcy will provide you protection from creditors who don't care that you were victimized, and this will, in the long run, likely help your situation financially. You can get out from under a bankruptcy in time, and rebuild your credit, and not have debts..whereas if you don't those debts accrue and it will become more expensive, with more collection agents after you. \n\nDeclaring bankruptcy will also be leverage in any future lawsuit you may file on them, and maybe in the criminal case against you as a victim-impact factor. \n\nDo it now. NOW.",

Ask them to stop the garnishment, refund the garnished money, and get your tax refund back.\n\nIf your parents' actions cause them to go to jail, that is on them, not you. It will never stop if you don't stop it, now.\n\nNTA. Good luck.\n\nPS: request credit reports from the 3 bureaus listed above. You may find other fraudulent accounts, and you can report those directly to them. They will investigate, and it may take a while, but it should go a long way toward fixing your credit history.",

In my country they expire when they are 6 so I am not really worried about this one. I am worried about the ones that I don't know... That's why I gave my mum an ultimatum before going NC and told her that I wanted her to give me a list of the things she had contracted under my name and a signed document where she says she is gonna pay for them or I will contact a lawyer. That's when she said all the duty/right thing and basically said that I was bluffing. Since then I have been thinking about what to do because even if they have done all of this, They are still my parents and I have always hoped that they will change and everything will be better. Also It's really difficult to get rid of the feeling that I am being selfish as I have been told. \n\nI am gonna try to make it all through a lawyer through a civil demand so they don't go to jail (which they could... In my country identity thieft is up to three of prison and here you go if you get more than two, even if you don't have prior record).\n\nTo those asking how do they spend the money: I don't know! I truly have no idea, I think they just live above their means.\n\nSome people have also asked about if it's abuse that I pay for my own education. Obviously, it is not. In my country, normally parents pay for their kids education (here it is not so expensive as in USA) or the kids get scholarships only if their parents can't pay. Since my parents were supposed to be able to pay, according to their salaries, I didn't receive any scholarship. But my parents didn't pay (even id they did pay for my brother's and sister's) so I had to do it myself (with my grandma's help) but they kept asking me for money that I needed to pay for it. So yes, I do consider they took advange on me.",

If that\u2019s the case then why didn\u2019t they feel the need to notify you that the bill was in your name? You should absolutely contact the police. I\u2019d imagine the courts can offer them a pay up or go to jail deal. This is really awful and I wish you the best. However, your story isn\u2019t that unique.

I think anything further than this opinion is above AITA&#39;s paygrade. </p>\n\n<p>People always tick of &quot;verbal abuse&quot; and &quot;physical abuse&quot; but they always always always forget &quot;financial abuse&quot;. I endured it for years in my marriage and it was a lifeline when I realized what it was and took off.</p>\n</div>",
