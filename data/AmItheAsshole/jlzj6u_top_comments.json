Why do racists get respect at all? Bollocks. </p>\n\n<p>Well done for standing up for yourself, keep it up!</p>\n</div>",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis has going on since forever so decided to do something. I\u2019m (16m) half Mexican from my dad\u2019s side and my mom\u2019s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom\u2019s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom\u2019s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.\n\nMy names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it\u2019s a shame I got stuck with it. I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.\n\nBut literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it\u2019s \u201ctoo many syllables\u201d (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me \u201cElliot\u201d as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it\u2019s not my name. \n\nIs always the same thing when I see them. She\u2019ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it\u2019s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don\u2019t like it but she always say I\u2019m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.\n\nSo I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it\u2019s bothering me more that she don\u2019t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. \n\nHer name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  \n\nTbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn\u2019t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d. I told her nah I\u2019mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.\n\nIt got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn\u2019t talk to me until we got home. \n\nShe say what I did was outta line and I don\u2019t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I\u2019m grounded until I do. Haven\u2019t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to \u201cinsult my grandmother\u201d ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m (16m) half Mexican from my dad\u2019s side and my mom\u2019s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom\u2019s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom\u2019s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.</p>\n\n<p>My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it\u2019s a shame I got stuck with it. I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.</p>\n\n<p>But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it\u2019s \u201ctoo many syllables\u201d (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me \u201cElliot\u201d as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it\u2019s not my name. </p>\n\n<p>Is always the same thing when I see them. She\u2019ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it\u2019s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don\u2019t like it but she always say I\u2019m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it\u2019s bothering me more that she don\u2019t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. </p>\n\n<p>Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  </p>\n\n<p>Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao.

As a latino myself i was always taught to show elders respect, regardless of whether they were right or wrong. The issue here is that your mom asked you not to make a deal of it, and you did anyways. It may be have been satisfying to disrespect the racist grandma, rightly so, but you also shamed and disrespected your mom.\n\nPersonally, I would have a talk with your mom and explain to her that while she may be trying to keep the peace with the family by asking you to just take it, that she's also shaming you when she does it. She's telling her family that she's ok with them pretending that you are not Mexican, and then ask your mom if she is ashamed to have married a Mexican man, and/or if she is ashamed of having a Mexican son. Considering she got with your father in the first place, I doubt your mom is racist, but just point out that when she just rolls over for her family regarding your name, it makes you feel like she is embarrassed by you, and how much that hurts YOU, her son. If she won't stand up for you to her family, then who will?\n\nAnother thing to do is draw in on yourself at these gatherings. If her family continues to disrespect you, then go stand in a corner or sit somewhere by yourself. Keep your eyes downcast and pretend to be a shadow. Say as little as you can while maintaining respect to the family, then if your mom asks what's wrong, or afterwards if she doesn't ask then bring it up yourself, and ask her if that's what she wants from you, to pretend to not be there to avoid making people uncomfortable about having a Mexican among them. Make your mother understand that when she lets them disrespect you, that she's letting them reject you, and to a point, that she's rejecting you as well.\n\nAnd for those cheering your civil disobedience, remember that civil disobedience is STILL disobedience, and it only matters so long as you're being punished. If it is important enough of an issue to you that you're willing to be punished, then don't complain, just endure. Without punishment, your civil disobedience is worth nothing.",

Mom is going to be of no help, rationalizing won\u2019t do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering what the grandma did to the mom growing up that convinced the mom that letting the grandma treat her child this way is okay.  Obviously, I don't know anything about op's family except what he's told us, but when I've seen that sort of thing happening elsewhere, it's normally because of a long history of family abuse that the mom thinks is totally normal because it's all she's ever known.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of narcissists, my dad refuses to call me or my aunt by our names.  My aunt eloped and changed her name and religion about 35 years ago, and my dad still insists on using her old name.  I changed my name 16 years ago.  The first name on my birth certificate is an Indian name my grandparents insisted on, but my mom never used it and taught me my middle name was my first name; she changed my name by deedpoll when I was 5, to formally erase the name we never used, and then again when I was 12 and she remarried my stepdad (I objected).  I changed my full first, middle, and last name at 16 because if someone was going to keep fucking with it, it might as well be something I liked rather than an ugly name my mom invented when she was 14 that was basically \"Renesmee\".  Anyway, the last time I challenged my dad on using the right name - one of the last times I spoke to him, about 3 years ago - he said he was being \"respectful\" to my mother by calling me by the name she chose.  Firstly, my mom was emotionally abusive, and, secondly, my dad broke my mum's arm when I was 3 (why they broke up), so that seemed like some pretty weak-ass reasoning to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNB: there's a very solid chance I'm just projecting this experience onto the OP, and their family is fine apart from racist grandma.  I'm not trying to say anything definitive, I'm just curious about how deep it goes for the mom.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>As already alluded to, his mom will tell him he should have just ignored it, let it happen, and he needs to apologize.

Obviously, I don&#39;t know anything about op&#39;s family except what he&#39;s told us, but when I&#39;ve seen that sort of thing happening elsewhere, it&#39;s normally because of a long history of family abuse that the mom thinks is totally normal because it&#39;s all she&#39;s ever known.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of narcissists, my dad refuses to call me or my aunt by our names.  My aunt eloped and changed her name and religion about 35 years ago, and my dad still insists on using her old name.  I changed my name 16 years ago.
