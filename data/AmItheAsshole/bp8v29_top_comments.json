This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nMy sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems she to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here?

What did your parents think was gonna happen? Did they all honestly expect you to just roll over and accept that your car is now hers and just suck it up? No, that is fucking ridiculous and about as unreasonable as it's possible to get. Make your parents read this thread. If they won't listen, follow them through the house reading peoples responses of how much they are all assholes for their behavior, her for stealing your car and them for expecting you to let her. Your sister committed a real life crime and is now facing real life consequences. That is her fault and her problem. She needs to grow up and realize accountability is a thing and she *will* be held to it, whether she likes it or not. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes.",

Thus your grandkids are not yours genetically. \n\nWhereas if your daughter cheats on her husband and becomes pregnant from someone else, they are still your grandkids.  I think the only ones who got it right are Jewish people, since they trace lineage through maternal lines.",
