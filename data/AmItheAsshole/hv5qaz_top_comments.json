You probably needed a different approach, though, but not because he has autism. \n\nThis is my take on it: \n\nBe direct about not wanting to continue taIking about whatever the person is insisting on talking about.  Directness, without rudeness, is usually effective in any annoying situation like this. The person will usually try to draw you back into the topic a few more times. Repeat exactly the same words you used the first time; \u201cWe can agree to disagree.

They just don't learn it as intuitively as everybody else.\n\nYou gave him an audience and a gentle teacher, untill he pushed past your boundaries.

Like it\u2019s a permanent excuse to never try to change their behavior. It\u2019s seen as a reason or an excuse, not a weapon they\u2019re wielding. Sometimes, probably  often, that\u2019s because they\u2019ve always been handled with kid gloves before and truly think it\u2019s an excuse. Sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re an asshole and think they shouldn\u2019t have to try. \n\nPeople without autism do this all the time too. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I am\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just always honest, I hate fake people\u201d. Those are just excuses people use to act like an ass without feeling bad about it. \n\nObviously people with autism have a harder time reading social cues. But non-assholes with autism take direct communication better than this dude and use it to try to do better in the future. Telling a non-asshole with autism \u201cThat was rude\u201d or \u201cThis specific thing you do makes me uncomfortable can you do this instead\u201d does not usually result in a \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against me because of my autism!\u201d retort or even \u201cI\u2019m autistic so I don\u2019t have to change my behavior\u201d. \n\nSomeone might reveal their autism in a particular situation as a way to explain \u201cHey I\u2019m not trying to be an ass, I didn\u2019t pick up on your discomfort. Please in the future be very direct so I know when I\u2019m making you uncomfortable or being rude.\u201d \n\nBut even if it truly is that this guy has always believed/been told that his autism means anyone pushing back on rude behavior just doesn\u2019t understand his condition and therefore is mean or discriminating, it doesn\u2019t make it true or okay. \n\nFWIW I\u2019m in STEM. And I\u2019ve worked with a number of people with autism, both in school and after. Very few of them would act like this dude. They might be embarrassed to be called out like that, but they wouldn\u2019t respond with that discrimination accusation. \n\nHonestly her friends, especially the one who brought K, should\u2019ve been more direct instead of trying to \u201cgently let him know he was out of line\u201d. The correct, and compassionate, to both K and OP, response to his behavior leading up to OP\u2019s last comment would\u2019ve been to directly say \u201cK, you\u2019re being rude. Stop being so aggressive. OP is the expert here, not you.

        "body": "Men who explain things\n\nBy Rebecca Solnit April 13, 200812 AM\nI still don\u2019t know why Sallie and I bothered to go to that party in the forest slope above Aspen. The people were all older than us and dull in a distinguished way, old enough that we, at 40-ish, passed as the occasion\u2019s young ladies. The house in Colorado was great -- if you like Ralph Lauren-style chalets: a rugged luxury cabin at 9,000 feet, complete with elk antlers, lots of kilims, and a wood-burning stove. We were preparing to leave when our host said, \u201cNo, stay a little longer so I can talk to you.\u201d He was an imposing man who\u2019d made a lot of money in advertising or something like that.\n\nHe kept us waiting while the other guests drifted out into the summer night, and then sat us down at his grainy wood table and said to me, \u201cSo? I hear you\u2019ve written a couple of books.\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cSeveral, actually.\u201d\n\nHe said, in the way you encourage your friend\u2019s 7-year-old to describe flute practice, \u201cAnd what are they about?\u201d\n\nThey were actually about quite a few different things, the six or seven out by then, but I began to speak only of the most recent on that summer day in 2003, my book on Eadweard Muybridge, the annihilation of time and space and the industrialization of everyday life.\n\nHe cut me off soon after I mentioned Muybridge. \u201cAnd have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?\u201d\n\nSo caught up was I in my assigned role as ingenue that I was perfectly willing to entertain the possibility that another book on the same subject had come out simultaneously and I\u2019d somehow missed it. He was already telling me about the very important book -- with that smug look I know so well in a man holding forth, eyes fixed on the fuzzy far horizon of his own authority.\n\nHere, let me just say that my life is well-sprinkled with lovely men, including a long succession of editors who have, since I was young, listened and encouraged and published me; with my infinitely generous younger brother; with splendid male friends. Still, there are these other men too.\n\nSo, Mr. Very Important was going on smugly about this book I should have known when Sallie interrupted him to say, \u201cThat\u2019s her book.\u201d Or tried to interrupt him anyway.\n\nBut he just continued on his way. She had to say, \u201cThat\u2019s her book\u201d three or four times before he finally took it in. And then, as if in a 19th century novel, he went ashen. That I was indeed the author of the very important book it turned out he hadn\u2019t read, just read about in the New York Times Book Review a few months earlier, so confused the neat categories into which his world was sorted that he was stunned speechless -- for a moment, before he began holding forth again. Being women, we were politely out of earshot before we started laughing.\n\nI like incidents of that sort, when forces that are usually so sneaky and hard to point out slither out of the grass and are as obvious as, say, an anaconda that\u2019s eaten a cow, or an elephant turd on the carpet.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that guys like this pick on other men\u2019s books, and people of both genders pop up at events to hold forth on irrelevant things and conspiracy theories, but the out-and-out confrontational confidence of the totally ignorant is, in my experience, gendered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMen explain things to me, and to other women, whether or not they know what they\u2019re talking about. Some men. Every woman knows what I mean. It\u2019s the presumption that makes it hard, at times, for any woman in any field; that keeps women from speaking up and from being heard when they dare; that crushes young women into silence by indicating, the way harassment on the street does, that this is not their world. It trains us in self-doubt and self-limitation just as it exercises men\u2019s unsupported overconfidence.\n\nThis syndrome is something nearly every woman faces every day, within herself too, a belief in her superfluity, an invitation to silence, one from which a fairly nice career as a writer (with a lot of research and facts correctly deployed) has not entirely freed me. After all, there was a moment there when I was willing to believe Mr. Very Important and his overweening confidence over my more shaky certainty.\n\nMore extreme versions of this syndrome exist in, for example, those Islamic countries where women\u2019s testimony has no legal standing; so that a woman can\u2019t testify that she was raped without a male witness to counter the male rapist. Which there rarely is.\n\nCredibility is a basic survival tool. When I was very young and just beginning to get what feminism was about and why it was necessary, I had a boyfriend whose uncle was a nuclear physicist. One Christmas, he was telling -- as though it were a light and amusing subject -- how a neighbor\u2019s wife in his suburban bomb-making community had come running out of her house naked in the middle of the night screaming that her husband was trying to kill her. How, I asked the physicist, did you know that he wasn\u2019t trying to kill her? He explained, patiently, that they were respectable middle-class people. Therefore, her-husband-trying-to-kill-her was simply not a credible explanation for why she was fleeing the house yelling that her husband was trying to kill her. That she was crazy, on the other hand....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven getting a restraining order -- a fairly new legal tool -- requires acquiring the credibility to convince the courts that some guy is a menace and then getting the cops to enforce it. Restraining orders often don\u2019t work anyway. Violence is one way to silence people, to deny their voice and their credibility, to assert your right to control over their right to exist. About three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses in this country. It\u2019s a leading cause of death among pregnant women in the U.S. At the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible.\n\nI tend to believe that women acquired the status of human beings when these kinds of acts started to be taken seriously, when the big things that stop us and kill us were addressed legally from the mid-1970s on; well after my birth, that is. And for anyone about to argue that workplace sexual violence isn\u2019t a life-or-death issue, remember that Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, age 20, was apparently killed by another Marine in December while she was waiting to testify that he allegedly raped her twice. The burned remains of her body and her fetus were found in the fire pit in his backyard in January, and he was arrested last week in Mexico. Being told that, categorically, he knows what he\u2019s talking about and she doesn\u2019t, however minor a part of any given conversation, perpetuates the ugliness of this world. Several years ago, I objected to the behavior of a couple of men, only to be told on both occasions that the incidents hadn\u2019t happened at all as I said they had, that I was subjective, delusional, overwrought, dishonest -- in a nutshell, female.\n\nMost of my life, I would have doubted myself and backed down. Having public standing as a writer of history has helped me stand my ground, but few women get that boost, and billions of women are out there on this 6-billion-person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives, that the truth is not their property, now or ever. This goes way beyond Men Explaining Things, but it\u2019s part of the same archipelago of arrogance.\n\nMen explain things to me, still. And no man has ever apologized for explaining, wrongly, things that I know and they don\u2019t. Not yet, but according to the actuarial tables, I may have another 40-something years to live, more or less, so it could happen. Though I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years after the idiot in Aspen, I was in Berlin giving a talk when a writer friend invited me to a dinner that included a male translator and three women a little younger than me who would remain deferential and mostly silent throughout the meal. Perhaps the translator was peeved that I insisted on playing a modest role in the conversation, but when I said something about how Women Strike for Peace, the extraordinary, little-known antinuclear and antiwar group founded in 1961, helped bring down the communist-hunting House Committee on Un-American Activities, Mr. Very Important II sneered at me. The House committee, he insisted, no longer existed in the early 1960s and, anyway, no women\u2019s group played such a role in its downfall. His scorn was so withering, his confidence so aggressive, that arguing with him seemed a scary exercise in futility and an invitation to more insult.\n\nI had written a book that drew from primary documents and interviews about Women Strike for Peace. But explaining men still assume that I am, in some sort of obscene impregnation metaphor, an empty vessel to be filled with their wisdom and knowledge. A Freudian would claim to know what they have and I lack, but intelligence is not situated in the crotch -- even if you can write one of Virginia Woolf\u2019s long mellifluous musical sentences about the subtle subjugation of women in the snow with your willie. Back in my hotel room, I Googled a bit and found that Eric Bentley in his definitive history of the House Committee on Un-American Activities credits Women Strike for Peace with \u201cstriking the crucial blow in the fall of HUAC\u2019s Bastille.\u201d In the early 1960s.\n\nDude, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re a carbuncle on the face of humanity and an obstacle to civilization. Feel the shame.",

One Christmas, he was telling -- as though it were a light and amusing subject -- how a neighbor\u2019s wife in his suburban bomb-making community had come running out of her house naked in the middle of the night screaming that her husband was trying to kill her. How, I asked the physicist, did you know that he wasn\u2019t trying to kill her? He explained, patiently, that they were respectable middle-class people. Therefore, her-husband-trying-to-kill-her was simply not a credible explanation for why she was fleeing the house yelling that her husband was trying to kill her. That she was crazy, on the other hand....</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n\n<p>Even getting a restraining order -- a fairly new legal tool -- requires acquiring the credibility to convince the courts that some guy is a menace and then getting the cops to enforce it. Restraining orders often don\u2019t work anyway. Violence is one way to silence people, to deny their voice and their credibility, to assert your right to control over their right to exist. About three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses in this country. It\u2019s a leading cause of death among pregnant women in the U.S. At the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to believe that women acquired the status of human beings when these kinds of acts started to be taken seriously, when the big things that stop us and kill us were addressed legally from the mid-1970s on; well after my birth, that is. And for anyone about to argue that workplace sexual violence isn\u2019t a life-or-death issue, remember that Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, age 20, was apparently killed by another Marine in December while she was waiting to testify that he allegedly raped her twice. The burned remains of her body and her fetus were found in the fire pit in his backyard in January, and he was arrested last week in Mexico. Being told that, categorically, he knows what he\u2019s talking about and she doesn\u2019t, however minor a part of any given conversation, perpetuates the ugliness of this world. Several years ago, I objected to the behavior of a couple of men, only to be told on both occasions that the incidents hadn\u2019t happened at all as I said they had, that I was subjective, delusional, overwrought, dishonest -- in a nutshell, female.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my life, I would have doubted myself and backed down. Having public standing as a writer of history has helped me stand my ground, but few women get that boost, and billions of women are out there on this 6-billion-person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives, that the truth is not their property, now or ever. This goes way beyond Men Explaining Things, but it\u2019s part of the same archipelago of arrogance.</p>\n\n<p>Men explain things to me, still. And no man has ever apologized for explaining, wrongly, things that I know and they don\u2019t. Not yet, but according to the actuarial tables, I may have another 40-something years to live, more or less, so it could happen. Though I\u2019m not holding my breath.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n\n<p>A few years after the idiot in Aspen, I was in Berlin giving a talk when a writer friend invited me to a dinner that included a male translator and three women a little younger than me who would remain deferential and mostly silent throughout the meal. Perhaps the translator was peeved that I insisted on playing a modest role in the conversation, but when I said something about how Women Strike for Peace, the extraordinary, little-known antinuclear and antiwar group founded in 1961, helped bring down the communist-hunting House Committee on Un-American Activities, Mr. Very Important II sneered at me. The House committee, he insisted, no longer existed in the early 1960s and, anyway, no women\u2019s group played such a role in its downfall. His scorn was so withering, his confidence so aggressive, that arguing with him seemed a scary exercise in futility and an invitation to more insult.</p>\n\n<p>I had written a book that drew from primary documents and interviews about Women Strike for Peace. But explaining men still assume that I am, in some sort of obscene impregnation metaphor, an empty vessel to be filled with their wisdom and knowledge. A Freudian would claim to know what they have and I lack, but intelligence is not situated in the crotch -- even if you can write one of Virginia Woolf\u2019s long mellifluous musical sentences about the subtle subjugation of women in the snow with your willie. Back in my hotel room, I Googled a bit and found that Eric Bentley in his definitive history of the House Committee on Un-American Activities credits Women Strike for Peace with \u201cstriking the crucial blow in the fall of HUAC\u2019s Bastille.\u201d In the early 1960s.</p>\n\n<p>Dude, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re a carbuncle on the face of humanity and an obstacle to civilization. Feel the shame.</p>\n</div>",
