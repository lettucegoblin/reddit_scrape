I dont like being in those situations, i get this feeling when people are doing that and the only way i can describe it is greasy. Theres a lot of rich guys in my area that act like this, always hanging out with girls that are 20 years younger than them, cheating on their wives and being assholes at local bars and restaurants. I remember this one time when i was 19 i saw a childhood friend downtown and he was wasted. I dont hang out with him much but hes a really good dude and i knew he had a long time girlfriend. This girl that i know whos kinda sketchy was also wasted and she was all over him, when he went to the bathroom i was like man lets go get some food and water, ur too fucked up and ur gonna ruin ur relationship. So we went and got some Mexican food and caught up. He still thanks me when i see him bc hes still with his girl and they seem really good together. Im really glad i didnt let that happen.",

So yeah, maybe some people can't be friends. But honestly ?

I haven't gotten to know my BF's female friends equally well, and I like some more than others personality wise, but I actualyl really like them and I'm glad he's got a mixed group. It was reassuring meeting him and knowing that he's someone who sees women as full interesting people to hang out with and respect.

No, but I absolutely wanted a man who can actually be friends with women and see us as people. \n\nMy mum grew up one best dude friend in a bunch of girls, so I never got that kind of talk, fortunately.  You're totally right.  Most Bi people manage not to cheat on their partners with everyone - and you can't ban everyone from their friends.

Maybe that's why I've always tried to go the extra mile with friends GFs, whatever their gender. \n\nI feel there are posts here on reddit that push what's appropriate for male/female friends  - when people complain their partner makes very sexual jokes with their friend, doesn't include the partner at all, clearly prioritises the friend, friend gets 'posessive' over the partner and it becomes a competition etc. But TBH those thigns would still be inappropriate in a same sex relationship, because crossing certain boundaries can be pretty appropriate. And yeah, some people cheat with their friends and ruin the fun for everyone. Unfortunately, some people will cheat.

        "body": "To quote the great Ali Wong... \u201cEverybody has HPV. It\u2019s okay. Everyone has it... come out already! .... And if you don\u2019t have HPV.... you gon\u2019 get it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had it, all my friends have had it, as long as it\u2019s the (statistically vastly more likely) kind that doesn\u2019t cause cancer, it\u2019s really no big deal. You can\u2019t treat it, so it\u2019s not worth your mental energy in worrying about. *Some* people present symptoms that are embarrassing more than anything, and the symptoms can be treated... but you\u2019ll still have HPV in your system until it moseys on out. *It\u2019s okay.*\n\nHonestly, most of my friends and I don\u2019t even technically know if it\u2019s cleared up by now because they\u2019ve stopped automatically testing for it in our area... since it turns out *everybody has it.*\n\nReal talk? STIs feel like a much bigger deal because of the stigma and inordinately extreme fear we\u2019ve all been taught. Practice safe sex, of course!!! But unless it\u2019s HIV (statistically the most unlikely), or Herpes (generally avoided by having honest partners who communicate about their breakouts/contagious periods... which also, conveniently, tend to involve a visible \u201cstop sign\u201d), as long as you just get tested frequently enough to avoid letting something go untreated for years, they\u2019re *not* a big deal. The most common STIs get detected, then treated with a week\u2019s worth of antibiotics (or fewer). If you\u2019re responsible about your sexual health and get tested according to whatever is reasonable for your sex life, then there\u2019s no need to freak out about getting an STI that\u2019s more often than not totally harmless if caught in time. The potentially serious effects of an STI that we\u2019ve all had hammered into us since puberty generally don\u2019t show up unless it\u2019s been in your system for a long time.\n\nLook, of course, we don\u2019t want to get STIs. I\u2019m *not* arguing that anyone should say \u201cfuck it\u201d and no longer take preventative measures to ensure their sexual health and safety as well as that of their partners\u2019. Get tested once a year *at least*, with your regular physical/check up - yes, even if you\u2019re in a committed relationship because, honestly, why not? More often if your sex life warrants it (no shame!) And if you DO test positive, don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s fine. It really is. Deal with it and move on. Don\u2019t let it weigh on you or make you feel any worse about yourself. Again. *It happens.* More than you realize.... In fact, 50% of the population will contract an STI before the age of 25. You don\u2019t hear about it often because everyone\u2019s equally as ashamed and afraid of the stigma, and everyone\u2019s assuming they\u2019re part of a shameful minority.\n\nWe all get sick, we all catch bugs from the people we interact with.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>To quote the great Ali Wong... \u201cEverybody has HPV. It\u2019s okay. Everyone has it... come out already! .... And if you don\u2019t have HPV.... you gon\u2019 get it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had it, all my friends have had it, as long as it\u2019s the (statistically vastly more likely) kind that doesn\u2019t cause cancer, it\u2019s really no big deal. You can\u2019t treat it, so it\u2019s not worth your mental energy in worrying about. <em>Some</em> people present symptoms that are embarrassing more than anything, and the symptoms can be treated... but you\u2019ll still have HPV in your system until it moseys on out. <em>It\u2019s okay.</em></p>\n\n<p>Honestly, most of my friends and I don\u2019t even technically know if it\u2019s cleared up by now because they\u2019ve stopped automatically testing for it in our area... since it turns out <em>everybody has it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Real talk? STIs feel like a much bigger deal because of the stigma and inordinately extreme fear we\u2019ve all been taught. Practice safe sex, of course!!! But unless it\u2019s HIV (statistically the most unlikely), or Herpes (generally avoided by having honest partners who communicate about their breakouts/contagious periods... which also, conveniently, tend to involve a visible \u201cstop sign\u201d), as long as you just get tested frequently enough to avoid letting something go untreated for years, they\u2019re <em>not</em> a big deal. The most common STIs get detected, then treated with a week\u2019s worth of antibiotics (or fewer). If you\u2019re responsible about your sexual health and get tested according to whatever is reasonable for your sex life, then there\u2019s no need to freak out about getting an STI that\u2019s more often than not totally harmless if caught in time. The potentially serious effects of an STI that we\u2019ve all had hammered into us since puberty generally don\u2019t show up unless it\u2019s been in your system for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Look, of course, we don\u2019t want to get STIs. I\u2019m <em>not</em> arguing that anyone should say \u201cfuck it\u201d and no longer take preventative measures to ensure their sexual health and safety as well as that of their partners\u2019. Get tested once a year <em>at least</em>, with your regular physical/check up - yes, even if you\u2019re in a committed relationship because, honestly, why not? More often if your sex life warrants it (no shame!) And if you DO test positive, don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s fine. It really is. Deal with it and move on. Don\u2019t let it weigh on you or make you feel any worse about yourself. Again. <em>It happens.</em> More than you realize....

        "body": "Oh man, I'm so sorry! I completely empathize and understand the anxiety. That really sucks...\n\nI actually had a somewhat similar experience, myself. Fully vaccinated couple years earlier, and I went to get my first real checkup/test in a few years at a walk-in clinic because I hadn't been able to afford medical care for so long. I was given the HPV diagnosis (having no idea how long I'd had it by then).... AND the doctor detected some abnormal cell growth that suggested potential tumors, apparently. \n\nHe recommended a specialist for a follow up, but I couldn't afford THAT. By a long shot. I went a full year before going back to a doctor, this time at Planned Parenthood (ugh, I'm forever grateful to them & their affordable care). *They* in turn found a lump in my breast, though they were MUCH better about explaining the alternative explanations and why I shouldn't panic.\n\nLong story short, after a year of anxiety, and the world's most drawn out cancer scare, it all turned out fine. No cancer, just HPV making things weird. This was a few years ago now, and I don't remember them telling me that they knew what strain it was (it might not have been a thing we could test for back then? I vaguely remember a joke about how when you found out you had HPV you got told that it could either be the kind that's no big deal, orrrr the kind that gives you cancer. And you just get to wait and see.\n\nAnyway, my point is - I know how that \"wait and see\" anxiety can move in and live rent-free in your head for months, years even. It can feel like crushing helplessness... there's nothing you can really do but wait out the clock wondering if there really is a ticking time bomb in your cervix, or it's just some sort of a cruel prank by the universe. ...Ok. So that's the *worst* way to think about your situation, especially while getting through it. Here's the good news: firstly, the odds are heavily in your favor. Yes, you're at risk, but your odds of getting high-risk HPV as opposed to the alternatives were twice as high as your likelihood of getting cancer once you have high-risk HPV. \n\nSecond, the fact that you got diagnosed is GREAT! You *know* that your risk for cervical cancer was increased for the time being, which means that you have all the tools you need to increase your vigilance accordingly. It would have been way worse to remain in the dark, and be completely unaware of the fact that you need to pay closer attention while your risk is increased. \n\nNow, to what you're *more* at risk of... right now, you're anxious about things developing into the worst case scenario, and your checkup appointments are a source of increased worry for you, because you're afraid of getting bad news at each subsequent visit, right? I get it. That's perfectly normal. However... this level of anxiety for a prolonged period is only going to affect you negatively, and in all probability, will be the biggest strain on your health during this time.\n\nFirst, and I know it's difficult, but I promise it gets easier- we need to slowly move away from holding onto any frustrations, stress about things that we have no control over. You got HPV. This happened, and you can't turn back time. Frustrating? Yes. Something we can change? No.\n\nTwo things we *can* change are our mental and tactical approach to situations. Technically, nothing is causing your stress apart from your own brain. I'd like to suggest you try reframing things so as to lessen the toll that extreme anxiety can take on you. There's no reason you can't take care of yourself and get through this with your health (mental and otherwise) fully in check. So, let's try seeing the good news in all this! \n\nAs I already mentioned, getting the diagnosis is a good thing! It's something worth feeling happy about. You had HPV with or without it, so the diagnosis is a positive event in your life because it alerted you to an issue you're now able to handle. *And* this was something *you* controlled by being proactive about your sexual health.\n\nYour risk of cervical cancer has increased, yes, but you and your doctor have already come up with a plan in order to neutralize this risk, haven't you? You've committed to more frequent check ups, increasing the vigilance to match the danger. This is also good news! Your doctor has most likely designed the frequency of your visits based on the safest timing for catching anything as early as possible. Your doctor's doing their job, which is to keep you safe. \n\nAgain, thing we can't control? What this HPV does next. Thing we can control? Keeping an eye on it and being prepared to nip things in the bud should we have to.\n\nAs for your worry around the appointments. You're hoping for good news, fearing bad, and using these checks as a way to understand what may or may not be going on internally, as if the news *is* the event. It's not.\n\nThing you can't control? What's going on in your body. Things you can control? Being proactive about getting all the information, and how you choose frame these visits in your mind.\n\nLook, obviously, no one would *hope* for \"bad news\" because they aren't hoping for cancer. But consider how valuable it is to receive this sort of \"bad news\" if the cancer already appeared on its own... just like the HPV diagnosis was valuable. Information is a weapon, especially in situations like this one.\n\nMaybe these appointments don't need to be a source of your fear, but rather something to look forward to. The reality is, the checkup won't really \"go badly.\" If it's good news, that's good, if it's bad news, that's *also* good! Because \"bad news\" means you've caught the problem in time to address it, just as you were prepared to do.\n\nThe thing you're most clearly able to control in this situation is the fact that you're taking preventative measures to ensure no serious health problems are permitted to develop and grow, silently and invisibly without your knowledge. You and your doctor have secured control over your body and health by being at the ready to defend it from any potential attacks while the enemy is still weak and easy to squash. You guys have the upper hand here. This sort of attack isn't preventable, but if it starts, it can be detected and stopped. Try not to fear the alarm that sounds, rather learn to appreciate it for alerting you to a danger that is imminent.\n\nI sincerely wish you the very best in dealing with this whole situation. Of course, I'm sending you all the luck I can, hoping your HPV will go away quietly and without further issues, but also in the hope that it won't cripple you with longterm anxiety while you wait it out. Remember, this isn't a \"worst case scenario\" at present, it's a \"best case scenario\" in dealing with shitty circumstances. You've got a handle on this.",
