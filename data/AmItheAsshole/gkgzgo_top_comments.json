I viewed her as a monster and still harbor resentments towards her. It bothers me when people say: \u201cOh, well she was sick,\u201d and it makes me even more angry.\n\nWhat? You expect me to want to be around someone who was abusing drugs, putting her addiction first before us? To be honest, the day my mom died was the most relieved I felt *ever*. \n\nRecently, I had her old friend contact me over FB, and she wanted to talk about her. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to, that it was too painful and would even make me angry talking about her. This person kept bringing it up, sending me pictures of her and I had a massive breakdown. My fianc\u00e9 had to block her after sending her a message for me, informing them that our memories of her are very different. I still get random people messaging me about her, distant relatives, or friends and I feel as if they\u2019re trying to reconnect with her through me. I wish they wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m an individual person, not a clone of her, and stirring-up those memories is not allowing me to heal. It sucks. \n\nSo, the oldest *should absolutely not* be pressured to have a relationship with their mother. She\u2019s not a mother to him and had lost that right as soon as she put drugs before her kids.\n\nOP, You\u2019re a hero to those kids. Don\u2019t allow family to make you feel guilty or make you out to be the bad guy.",

No one picked me up from school so I got a ride home with a friend.  When I got home no one was there.  I don't know how long I was by myself, but it must have been days, maybe a week?  I have blocked out a lot of my childhood but I vaguely remember trying to call people, trying to find my parents (I didn't know my dad was on a trip either) trying to find food, and being very scared.  \n\nMy mom came home.  She had a cast on her leg and was incoherent.  She wouldn't tell me where she had been or where my dad was.  I thought he had died.  I cared for her, made her food, helped her wash herself and use the bathroom.  I tried to talk to her but she was mentally out of it.  One day she was just gone again.  I didn't know what happened.  I was alone again for some amount of time.  When she came home again she was in better spirits but still wouldn't say what was happening.  After a few months she could care for herself more and she drove me to school (I had missed months of school).  \n\nI kept asking about my dad and she would get mad and yell at me and hit me if I was close enough.  I remember making sure I was across the room and she didn't have anything to throw before asking.  I hid her crutches and she eventually said, \"Your dad left before he's sick of being around you!\"  I believed her but I was just glad he was alive.\n\nMonths later she asked if I wanted to visit him.  I was excited to but hesitant because he hadn't wanted to see me before.  I stayed overnight at his place.  I was very quiet and tried not to be annoying.  He didn't know how to cook or didn't think to.  I slept on the floor and there was no food.  I went back home to mom's house.  \n\nYears later I found out she broke her leg having sex with her boyfriend and had an allergic reaction to the painkillers she was on.  Dad found out about the cheating and left her without checking on me.  She told him I didn't want to see him and he didn't push it.  For years this ruined my relationship with my dad.

Especially not children that are abandoned by their parent(s). </p>\n\n<p>I find it appalling that she did not even ask for his health but instead made the call about her. </p>\n\n<p>And honestly, should other members of your &quot;family&quot; give you flak over how things went down, my suggestion is to take a good long look at them and see if they need to be in your and your children&#39;s lives. Blood does not mean family. Sometimes, the best thing to do is cut out the rot so the rest of the plant can grow healthy and strong.</p>\n\n<p>As a related topic, if you have not watched the movie &quot;Instant Family&quot; with Mark Wahlberg, you really should. All I am going to say is that it is related to your post.</p>\n\n<p>I wish you and your family all the best.</p>\n\n<p>Live Long and Prosper!  \ud83d\udd96</p>\n</div>",

You're these kids hero and even if the youngest ones don't realize it yet the eldest certainly does.\n\nTo the question at hand, are you AH for not letting your sister see her kids? Heck no! You're not keeping her from her kids, she's the one who messed up, she's the reason she doesn't see her kids. As far as the extended family and their opinion? I get it, most people will try to justify any parent maintain at least tacit relationship with their mother. So I get it, and I also don't care.\n\nThe eldest even as young as they are now feels safe, loved and protected and likely doesn't like the idea of reintroducing this woman into their life and possibly disrupt or ruin the kids' good lives they have now. In addition to their feelings you also have to know that the incident that led to her losing them is likely not the only time their mother abandoned them to go do her own thing. What's more the incident probably isn't even the worst thing they've experienced or seen while under her care. Please respect the eldest opinion and in no way guilt or force this child to see or visit her.\n\nI have infinite respect for you stepping up for and providing for these children. Remember no matter what anyone else says YOU are now their mother. As such it's your job to protect and nurture them and your view on what is best is the only one that matters. You are the one with them 24/7, you are the one who provides financially and emotionally, don't let anyone say otherwise or guilt you into doing something you don't feel is best for them.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Oh my god OP, I didn&#39;t see the first post when it was new but in no way shape or form are you in any way the AH here. If anything you are an angel for taking this responsibility on. You&#39;re these kids hero and even if the youngest ones don&#39;t realize it yet the eldest certainly does.</p>\n\n<p>To the question at hand, are you AH for not letting your sister see her kids? Heck no! You&#39;re not keeping her from her kids, she&#39;s the one who messed up, she&#39;s the reason she doesn&#39;t see her kids. As far as the extended family and their opinion? I get it, most people will try to justify any parent maintain at least tacit relationship with their mother. So I get it, and I also don&#39;t care.</p>\n\n<p>The eldest even as young as they are now feels safe, loved and protected and likely doesn&#39;t like the idea of reintroducing this woman into their life and possibly disrupt or ruin the kids&#39; good lives they have now. In addition to their feelings you also have to know that the incident that led to her losing them is likely not the only time their mother abandoned them to go do her own thing. What&#39;s more the incident probably isn&#39;t even the worst thing they&#39;ve experienced or seen while under her care. Please respect the eldest opinion and in no way guilt or force this child to see or visit her.</p>\n\n<p>I have infinite respect for you stepping up for and providing for these children.

After years of seeing her and being manipulated to hell I finally decided it was enough and that I was done. I felt that she was never going to change so I had to accept it and move on. I fully moved in with my dad and it was the best choice I made. For years I was yelled at and criticized by my mothers side of the family. They felt the same way as yours does. It was my fathers job to make me see my mom and if he didn\u2019t he was a terrible person. My mother was the worst of all of them. She gaslight me so often that I would sob every night. I am so thankful that no matter what, he never forced me to see her. He put up with hell from people he use to call family. My dad and I created the strongest bond and he\u2019s the only person I truly trust. I\u2019m so thankful that he looked at me like a true human being and not just a kid that didn\u2019t know what I wanted. You\u2019re doing the right thing. Don\u2019t let your family pressure you. Your nephew will be okay without her. It took my mom hitting rock bottom and losing all of us to change. I rarely talk to her but we\u2019re finally building a relationship 5 years later. Hopefully your sister will change too. Good luck and thank you for being what my dad was for me, to your nephew.",

Later, when I as 10 or so, my aunt and cousin took me in and during the hearing to transfer custody to them, the judge asked me what I wanted and that was such an amazing feeling.  I was all for it and it probably would have happened either way, but just that my opinion was acknowledged was huge.

I missed the first post so this is a lot to unpack, but hopefully I can give you some hope.\n\nI\u2019m 28 and this year finally reconnected with my biological mother (biomom for short). There was a super nasty divorce when I was 9-10 and I moved in with my dad after a very long battle at 14 and I stopped talking to her at all at 18 because she was toxic and abusive. Fast forward to now: as an adult I have decided how I feel about things and decided to rekindle the relationship. \n\nI say all of that so that you can take hope that your oldest son may eventually grow up to overcome this - but his path is going to be VERY hard. I never had therapy, I never did extracurricular activities in school and my self esteem suffered; but if you can help him with all of that, I think he\u2019ll do well. You\u2019re already acting like an amazing mother and I want you to know he will see that, even though puberty is really going to suck for both of you. \n\n\nAlso. I have more experience in a similar scenario to yours with my youngest cousin who\u2019s mom was constantly on drugs and making bad decisions as well. My cousin was also considered special education in school, so he had a long path ahead. He grew up with his grandma for the most part - he did get to see his mom but from my understanding they hid that she did drugs and bad things for the most part, and just made it seem like she wasn\u2019t able to keep him (I mean, she wasn\u2019t). Fast forward hes now... we\u2019ll 20 now I think (haven\u2019t talked to him in a few years but anyways) and he still talks to his mom some, but most importantly thanks to his grandmas love and hard work, he maintained good grades and despite his \u201cspecial ed\u201d was admitted to Georgia Tech - a very high intellect school in the southeast with high admission bars. I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s doing emotionally or his relationship with his mother, but my point of sharing it is so that you can take hope and solace that while the journey ahead is going to be rough, it\u2019s also going to be worth it.\n\n\nI\u2019m really sorry you were forced into this situation but I\u2019m really happy the kids have you now. Thank you so much for stepping in for them, and take everything one step at a time. Your sister has no legal rights now, and she needs to understand why you are protecting her children.",

It sounds like you handled the situation\u2014before, after, and during the call\u2014beautifully. I would keep reassuring the kids that they are yours, explain the legality to the oldest, and how you will never give them up because you love them and want what\u2019s best for them. They\u2019re going to need to hear this multiple times. I\u2019m so sorry your sister turned out to be so awful, and those kids are so lucky to have you. I hope you all have a beautiful life and that you don\u2019t have to deal with your sister anymore. Sadly I know she will probably try to pop back up, so I\u2019d definitely encourage you to make anyone/anyplace the kids go aware of the situation and that if she appears to call you (I\u2019d even recommend carrying around her picture so you can show people). Especially the schools. I\u2019d also put an emergency plan in place with the kids so they know what to do if she shows up. I\u2019m so sorry you even have to think about this. Thanks so much for letting us know what happened. I\u2019m really rooting for you all.",

The rest of your family really sounds like they don\u2019t get how toxic and permanently damaging your sister was to your kids. It sounds like you handled the situation\u2014before, after, and during the call\u2014beautifully. I would keep reassuring the kids that they are yours, explain the legality to the oldest, and how you will never give them up because you love them and want what\u2019s best for them. They\u2019re going to need to hear this multiple times. I\u2019m so sorry your sister turned out to be so awful, and those kids are so lucky to have you. I hope you all have a beautiful life and that you don\u2019t have to deal with your sister anymore. Sadly I know she will probably try to pop back up, so I\u2019d definitely encourage you to make anyone/anyplace the kids go aware of the situation and that if she appears to call you (I\u2019d even recommend carrying around her picture so you can show people). Especially the schools. I\u2019d also put an emergency plan in place with the kids so they know what to do if she shows up. I\u2019m so sorry you even have to think about this. Thanks so much for letting us know what happened. I\u2019m really rooting for you all.</p>\n</div>",

They likely coddle her as if she&#39;s still a child and they are completely ignoring what is best for the actual children.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared in the future for the two who have no memory of her to be curious and want to meet her in the future. </p>\n\n<p>One day she might be ready to accept responsibility for her actions and I hope she goes to therapy and gets the help she needs. Until she does this I wouldn&#39;t allow her to see them again unless they ask. Even then proceed with caution.</p>\n</div>",

They asked me for a color photo of her, her car details, a description, and her license number (if I had it). What they did was ID anyone who tried to pick her up BEFORE they were allowed to even see my daughter. She did end up trying to pick her up, without my knowledge or consent, and was escorted off the property via police. They also had me give an approved list of people who could pick her up. \n\nJust make it VERY clear that you are the legal guardian and that she may attempt to KIDNAP the children. Explain the situation as best you can. To the principal of the school, and then the school counselor. \n\nI also suggest you find therapy for your kids, if you haven\u2019t.

We also lived with her. </p>\n\n<p>We had a really nasty fall out and had to have police involved multiple times. My daughter was in school, and I CAN tell you;schools do have procedures in place should someone you explicitly state should not pick up your kids try to. They asked me for a color photo of her, her car details, a description, and her license number (if I had it). What they did was ID anyone who tried to pick her up BEFORE they were allowed to even see my daughter. She did end up trying to pick her up, without my knowledge or consent, and was escorted off the property via police. They also had me give an approved list of people who could pick her up. </p>\n\n<p>Just make it VERY clear that you are the legal guardian and that she may attempt to KIDNAP the children. Explain the situation as best you can. To the principal of the school, and then the school counselor. </p>\n\n<p>I also suggest you find therapy for your kids, if you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s been helpful for my daughter.</p>\n</div>",

She put the poor boy through hell, and then at 4 showed up at his father\u2019s and said \u201cI\u2019m done with him, you can have him.\u201d But for some really stupid and lazy reasons, she retained legal custody of him (also fraudulently collected public assistance, food stamps, and WIC for him!) His dad and grandmother raised him, but the \u201cmom\u201d kept the threat of \u201cI still have custody, I can take him away\u201d over him and his father for years. It was sick.\n\nShe had several more children (two of whom looked suspiciously like my own children as infants, and more than half like their older *half* brother! DNA tests have since confirmed why...), and while pregnant with still another, was *FINALLY* arrested for child abuse and drug possession, after literally having *DOZENS* of reports filed against her by well over a dozen different people. But she put a baby in the hospital and they couldn\u2019t look away. So...the kids ended up somehow being placed with my ex\u2019s mother, the grandmother of the eldest child. She ended up with custody of all FOUR kids, including her own biological grandson, due to his father\u2019s failure to take action and file.\n\nShe raised them from the age of 2 1/2, 18 mos, and 7 mos, and then several years later ended up with custody of *another* sibling, a baby sister, when she was 4 mos old after she was removed during a drug raid (the egg donor bitch had one die at birth at 28 weeks pregnant, bizarrely enough named for my own ex, her son\u2019s *uncle* who hated her, and then had still another, before the youngest girl, a son who was placed in foster care and then adopted. CPS all but forced her to get her tubes tied after the youngest was born, or have her removed, and then she fucked up and he was removed anyway.)\n\nWhen the eldest girl (the second child) was 8, and the others were 7, 6, and 3, my kids\u2019 grandmother, their \u201cMama,\u201d passed very suddenly from cancer (so rapid that she had three weeks from when they found it until she was gone!). When it happened, her daughter (my ex\u2019s sister and my kids\u2019 aunt) had already worked with CPS and made arrangements; she\u2019d filed for custody and was awaiting a court appearance when her mother passed, and within days she had full custody of the four kids (the eldest brother had moved away with his father and new stepmother, who was the first actual \u201cmom\u201d he\u2019d ever had; as it turned out though, the grandmother had kept custody of him, and it transferred to the sister later along with the others; they found out under some tragic circumstances which ended up drawing CPS attention, sadly, but that was quickly resolved and the father received full custody after all). I remember her posting on Facebook, \u201cJust became the parent of four kids. Wow.\u201d as she walked out of court.\n\nIt\u2019s been three years, and she\u2019s done everything for them. But if you ask the eldest girl, she\u2019ll say \u201cMy mom is in prison,\u201d but the littlest will tell you, \u201cNo, my mama died.\u201d (My 14-yo almost cried when she said that, right in front of the aunt!)",

But if you ask the eldest girl, she\u2019ll say \u201cMy mom is in prison,\u201d but the littlest will tell you, \u201cNo, my mama died.\u201d (My 14-yo almost cried when she said that, right in front of the aunt!)</p>\n</div>",

I'm doing better now with the anxiety, it's no longer crippling, but I still tend to drink a medium amount at the end of each day to calm down.\n\nTrust me alcohol is actually one of the most addictive and easy to overdose drugs out there. I think like only morphine and heroin score worse. \n\nThe problem is that you can't go down to the corner store and by some opium or xanax instead of booze. If booze were as hard to get and expensive as other drugs I would never have really done it. It's just cheap, abundant, heavily advertised, and numbs your emotions, and makes you forget the bad in your life. In my case I have a long family history of alcoholics. \n\nI have seen studies that taking lsd is extremely effective at treating it though. I used to trip somewhat frequently but I'm now on a psych med that blocks the specific sub receptor in the brain that makes you trip. So it's like I would have to come off my schizophrenia meds to trip which might be worse.\n\nBut it's worth trying if you're an alcoholic. You got nothing to lose, at the worst you'll feel negative feelings for a little, at best euphoria and enlightenment. That's a gamble I would take anyday.",
