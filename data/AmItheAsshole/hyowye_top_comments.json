He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. \n\nWhile I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.\n\nI've seen his wife's social media, and she's posting about \"bastards wanting a payday\" and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn't have just used the legal system to get money that wasn't technically mine. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion\">this</a> before <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole\">contacting the mod team</a></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have a relationship with my biological father. He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I&#39;m her only child. He&#39;s never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. </p>\n\n<p>While I couldn&#39;t independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen his wife&#39;s social media, and she&#39;s posting about &quot;bastards wanting a payday&quot; and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn&#39;t have just used the legal system to get money that wasn&#39;t technically mine. AITA?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The court reduced it by $5.00 a month in order to meet the child support guidelines in my state. My ex absolutely freaked out and threatened to never see the kids again if I didn't take less money. An acquaintance who is a family counselor gave me some very good advice. She said that money was not mine and I had no right to take it away from my kids. At the time, with the threat hanging over my head, this was tough to hear so to compromise, I offered to reduce it about $50 more a month and he would not agree. Instead he cut his kids completely out of his life. So it really wasn't about the money. It was about wanting to take the easy way out and to just bail. So I listened to that counselor and I used that money to pay for family trips, dance and drama lessons, sports, band instruments, my son's FIRST robotics team participation, and much more. Both my kids went to college and my son is a computer engineer with a great job--thank you robotics team!! Meanwhile my ex's new wife has pretty much bankrupted them due to her shopping habits. A repo man showed up at my house looking for her to grab her car. Thank goodness the child support came straight out of his check. I'm so glad it helped create a fun and educational childhood and adolescence for my kids.",
