Others can be mad as they want to be, that doesn&#39;t erase how tone deaf and ignorant your sil acted. Mary needed someone to take her down a peg. Given you said she likes being the center of attention, this is obviously not her first time being an egotistical, selfish asshole. Just because they refuse to admit their error and fault in this incident doesn&#39;t make them innocent. Just because they place the blame on you being the bad guy doesn&#39;t mean you are. In reality, they are the assholes and whether they ever accept it is on them and just proves how big of assholes they really are.</p>\n</div>",

I would have made sure to frame everything around how heartless and cruel she is; that she needs to develop a conscience she so obviously lacks. How dare she come there when her only intention was to take advantage of a large gathering she could try and make an audience to her performance. That now would have been a good time to practice putting someone else&#39;s <em>needs</em> before your <em>wants</em>, something that will be an integral part of parenting that life inside her she&#39;s so happy to use for attention.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t yell, but I do lower my voice to a very forceful and precise tone. I wouldn&#39;t care who noticed, so long as it got SIL to leave. No matter what OP said, the end justifies the means in this scenario.</p>\n\n<p>OP, I am so sorry for the tragedy that has fallen upon your loved ones. You stood up and did what was needed. You were your cousins&#39; sword and shield in that moment, and you did amazing. Hold your head high. </p>\n\n<p>Your cousin and her daughter will be held close in my heart \u2764</p>\n</div>",

This kind of pain is deep, and terrible, and very hard to come back from.\n\nI hope with all my heart that one day your poor grieving cousin is able to forgive herself. She did nothing wrong, nothing at all. It should have been a perfectly ordinary decision for the kids to go with her husband so she could get the chores done. We all make decisions like this on a daily basis, hundreds if not thousands of times...and she is NOT at fault for the fact that on this one day, this one time, the consequences were terrible beyond imagining. That was just blind, awful bad luck.\n\nAnd everything you did here is completely acceptable, understandable, and justified. Your SIL is incredibly selfish, and your cousin is lucky to have you. You are a good person.",
