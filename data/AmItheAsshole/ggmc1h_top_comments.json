Something I have noticed that has become a trend is queer people using their sexuality or gender identity as an excuse for their shitty behavior and if someone calls them out for their shitty behavior they scream HATE CRIME or something. No, you are not homophobic. Just because your brother is gay doesn\u2019t mean he can trample on people without repercussions. I have huge concerns for those children and for your best friends sister. There is a better way to go about coming out to your wife as gay, and while it isn\u2019t easy, it isn\u2019t THAT! He resents her for \u201ckeeping him from sleeping with men for years\u201d? Oh my god, how selfish can you get? He flipped this poor woman\u2019s world on its head, and brought two innocent children into the gunfire. My sisters ex husband did this. It ruined her sense of self for a long time, made her feel ugly and undesirable, and made their child\u2019s early years difficult. NOT THE ASSHOLE. Your brother needs to see a therapist.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Oh my GOD NTA! I hate whipping out the gay card, but as an extremely queer person, you are not being homophobic. Seriously, what the fuck is your brothers problem? Something I have noticed that has become a trend is queer people using their sexuality or gender identity as an excuse for their shitty behavior and if someone calls them out for their shitty behavior they scream HATE CRIME or something. No, you are not homophobic. Just because your brother is gay doesn\u2019t mean he can trample on people without repercussions. I have huge concerns for those children and for your best friends sister. There is a better way to go about coming out to your wife as gay, and while it isn\u2019t easy, it isn\u2019t THAT! He resents her for \u201ckeeping him from sleeping with men for years\u201d? Oh my god, how selfish can you get? He flipped this poor woman\u2019s world on its head, and brought two innocent children into the gunfire. My sisters ex husband did this. It ruined her sense of self for a long time, made her feel ugly and undesirable, and made their child\u2019s early years difficult. NOT THE ASSHOLE. Your brother needs to see a therapist. And so does his wife, for different reasons. I wish the best for her and those kiddos. I am so glad you seem to be supportive of her, and that you aren\u2019t feeding into your brother\u2019s fucking AWFUL excuses.</p>\n</div>",

There is a lot of homophobia in the world, and sometimes I feel that certain individuals will throw out accusations of homophobia just because they are opposed in any way/shape/form, even if it doesn't have anything to do with their sexuality - which sounds like your brother's rationale. You are disowning your brother for the actions listed above, and any rational person would probably do the same - whether your brother is gay or straight, the actions would still be horrible. You aren't being homophobic just because you're speaking out against his recent actions towards his wife.\n\nI also think your brother's feelings towards his wife are kind of bizarre. I definitely understand a growing feeling of resentment towards being in a heterosexual marriage/relationship when you are actually gay. But it seems like OP's brother thinks that his wife is at fault for the situation, when in reality, his wife wasn't forcing him to be straight, she just was totally unaware that he thought he was gay. God forbid she is in what she thought to be a heterosexual marriage and is upset by her husband cheating on her. The resentment is understandable, but it is not fair for him to antagonize her for \"forcing\" him into not sleeping with other men when he chose to marry and start a family with her.\n\nNobody can force your brother to come out at any time when he doesn't want to. But if he knew he was gay and was staying in the closet for career-related reasons, he still should not have married a woman. And just because he wants to come out now does not mean that he gets a free pass for being horrible to his wife. He resents her? Well, he allowed their relationship to develop the way it did, the responsibility is at least partially on him for the consequences of staying in the closet through all of that. The issue at hand isn't that he is gay and choosing to come out now. The issue, which you are not homophobic for taking massive issue with, is that he is attacking and antagonizing his wife and thinks its okay because he blames her for him being in the relationship.",

He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. \n\nMy brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n\nSince then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.\n\nI told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think your mom is a bit of an AH here, her grandchildren were kicked out of their house, are being abandoned by their father and having to watch their mother (their only parent active in their lives now and probably only ever will be) cry and have to struggle to pick up the pieces of their lives that he ruined.. and all your mother cares about is being pissy that you are one of the sane ones calling him on his BS? good grief.. it has nothing to do with homophobia and everything to do with him being a heartless, cheating SOB. Feel free to show her this post! In my opinion she needs to be called out on her BS too.</p>\n</div>",

He's a husband and a father ffs and he goes behind her back and completely wrecks the family, and then resents HER?! Nobody stopped him sleeping with men but himself, and recently obviously nothing at all stopped him! What is he on about?! He chose to marry and have children even though he knew he was gay. He's broken a woman's heart and then kicked her and his children to the kirb like he's the victim here?! He doesn't care, I bet he'd use *anything* just to get them out of his way. Seriously this makes my blood boil. Selfish prick. It's quite obvious from the way he's acting that he cares about nothing but himself,  has no regard for anyone else's feelings and only cares about sex. He's acting like a teenager. \n\nIf I were this poor woman, I wouldn't out him on social media just because I'm not a dick like he is, but I absolutely would post something along the lines of \"just so everyone's aware, I was not the one sleeping with multiple people behind his back\". Idc, she shouldn't be tarnished and quite frankly he deserves some consequences to his actions as he's seemingly living it up as if he hasn't just ruined several lives, 2 of which he created. She needs to go after him asap for child support as I'll assume he isn't paying. \n\n\nYou are not homophobic. Your family are excusing this man's shitty behaviour.  Put blunty, you care about his treatment of others and not who's cock he sucks. Don't feel the need to \"forgive\" him because you shouldn't.  Please try to reach out and support his wife and children where you can. I hope they're coping as well as they can.",

He could at fucking least not take it out on the kids..which clearly is happening bc idgaf how you feel about the mother or for what reason, you don&#39;t evict and abandon your kids. He is absolutely responsible for his actions and needs a swift kick in the ass so maybe he will get himself together and realize <em>2 human beings</em> are alive today because of him and he needs to be there for them. Fuck.</p>\n</div>",

I'm a man myself if it helps.\n\nWhile I agree there's some truth to it, there's also a big narrative around it. I read a couple articles related to the subject and one of them stood out, with stats. \nMost father's right activist will complain about who gets to have custody of the kids, but most men do not even want to have custody of the kids since it is a decision made by both parents. \n\nThe stats behind how much time fathers and mothers spend time taking care of the kids are very straightforward as well. Sure there's progress, but in Quebec, a man has to be a stay at home dad while the mom is working to spend the same amount of time. \n\nSo the whole narrative is a bit disturbing, pushed by unfaithful actors and sometimes state (such as Russia) that tries to undermine society cohesion, and seeing it push by random people on the internet disturbs me. \n\nMy 2 cents :) \n\n\n- Stats regarding custody: https://erlichlegal.com/blog/single-fathers-single-mothers-child-custody-statistics/\n- Article regarding a divorce law practice behind a big website related about father's right:\nhttps://theoutline.com/post/4938/fathers-rights-mens-rights-dot-com?zd=2&zi=cr67tq34",
