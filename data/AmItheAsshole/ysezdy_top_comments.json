Brother is hopefully blinded by Baby Love and not realizing what bad influences they are on this (and how detrimental it would be to her to be openly favored over her cousins. That&#39;s just asking for personality malfunctions and future therapy.) Parents need to get their heads on straight, I&#39;d maybe leave an invitation open to brother&#39;s family for Sara and baby niece&#39;s sake, but your parents made their own bed when they decided 80% of your family Doesn&#39;t Count since they&#39;re not biologically related to them. I&#39;m so sorry your kids had to deal with that.</p>\n</div>",

I know I can't be in the same room as any of you right now...and I would never put MY children in the position to have any of you treat them like shit again.  So I have no choice but to do what is best for them.*\n\n*I have never been more disappointed in you than I am today and I honestly do not know if this is something I will ever be able to forgive....but I do know that I will never forget it and the way I see the two of you has been forever tainted.*\n\nNTA\n\nThe reason I say you should go no contact is because after all of this...the only thing your mother is worried about is her first grandchild's first thanksgiving being ruined.\n\nEven after knowing you are pissed off and that she hurt your children..she doubled down again.\n\nActions have consequences and you have to hold your parents accountable...your brother too since he seemingly only cares about himself",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.\n\nMy brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife weren\u2019t treated like they didn\u2019t belong.\nMy brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.\n\nThe kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.\nIvan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.\n\nMy kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.\n\nSara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d\n\nMy dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children.\n\nMy wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine.\n\nI left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.\n\nMy brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving.\n\nI haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's hurtful and cruel.   \n\nMy first question was, \"Well, what do the kids call OP's parents?\"  Because if they call them by their names, yeah, I could see the attachment between both parties might not be that strong.  But no, my OP's parents' request they call them Nana & Pop.   Personal reference, I met my ex when my daughter was an older teenager and she met my MIL as an adult.  I asked MIL what she'd prefer my daughter call her (as with my daughter's age it wasn't like she'd be as close as MIL's grandkids).  She said whatever my daughter would be comfortable with and told her that her kids call her Nana or she can call her by her first name, just go with what feels best.    \n\nSecond thought was, \"Okay, yeah, some people get scared to get attached to the step-family because if there's a divorce they might not get to see them again.\"   But again, that excuse is foiled.  OP adopted the kids a few years ago.   \n\nTo wrap this up, any out that I saw to give the parents leeway was closed down.  OP is NTA but the parents are for sure.

See how he likes it when someone claims his kid isn't really related because of some arbitrary and minor factor in the overall definition of what it means to be a parent. \n\nI just had a friend say he wasn't sure if he wanted to date this woman he just started seeing because she didn't want to have any more kids after her daughter and he wants kids. I asked how old the daughter was and he said 2. I said that's young enough for her to consider him her dad and his response absolutely disgusted me. He said he wasn't raising \"someone one else's kid\". He said it was important to him that his kids be biological to pass on his line. To me, that's such archaic thinking. Like, what makes his DNA so damn special that it has to be passed on. Like, unless you're royalty and heir to a throne by divine blood then your genes aren't any more important than anyone else's (not that I believe in divine blood, but speaking to cultural/societal/religious significance of blood heritage). To me it then just sounds like it's not that he wants to be a father but rather he wants to procreate. Cuz if he wanted to actually be a *father* he wouldn't have seen it as \"raising someone else's kid\", he'd see it as raising *a kid*, because a kid isn't property, it's a person. Also, by saying that he indirectly implied that orphans and foster kids either don't deserve parents or the parents who adopt them or use donors to conceive are saps for raising \"someone else's kid\". And he shouldn't date anyone with children then even if they're willing to have his kids cuz he's going to end up treating their child as other/less than his own children. No child should be subjected to that feeling. While I didn't stop being his friend, I certainly lost a lot of respect for him. It just seemed like such a self-centered and selfish way to view parenting. And I don't even want or like children.",

He's doing well with her, now, but the amount of times people that would say things like, \"Well, you're just his aunt\" or \"You're not really his mother\" (in front of the my nephew) started to really weigh on my mental health. The kindergarten teacher even made a comment *to my nephew* that, \"she's just your aunt\" that really hurt. I still had full custody of his at this point. Proud moment for me was his response, which something to the effect of, \"my real mom isn't around, so my aunt is my mom.\"",
