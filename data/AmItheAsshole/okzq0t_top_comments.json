I don\u2019t know the process for it, but I know it\u2019s possible. \n\nPack these belongings up safe in an easily portable bag (if the bag isn\u2019t waterproof I highly recommend keeping the legal papers inside a plastic bag just in case!) and hide it.  Possibly keep it in your car, but that comes with a multitude of different risks, so use your best judgment. You could also take your documents over to your bio dads or mail them to him depending on how far away he lives.  \n\nDefinitely report your parents to the police for theft like others have recommended. You may want to wait till you\u2019ve gotten your living situations sorted and are out of their house. \n\nThat\u2019s my good advice.
