Absolutely gross. \n\nHe didn't trust you. He put down unnecessary boundaries. When you didn't follow them, he sabotaged his own child's happiness so he could get his way. \n\nI hate saying this on reddit, but I would truly consider divorce. This is not just a mistake and even if it was, he's standing by what he did. Your son does not deserve this kind of selfishness to have any control of his life. Plus, four years of marriage and he doesn't trust you to this degree? That's mad.",

You do not seem to have given him any reason to doubt you. </p>\n\n<p>So to clarify:</p>\n\n<p>Your husband tried to convince your son his friend was ditching him. Your son, who has been in a vunerable place (as someone who had a big health issue when I was young, I felt disconnected from others my age who I felt couldn&#39;t understand my feelings and also that my friends lives were ongoing without me, leaving me feeling seperate stuck at home in recovery), so having a friend around so much was probably super helpful for his sake. </p>\n\n<p>Your husband selfishly tried to take away your son&#39;s closest friend during a period of difficulty for your son BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS AND PARANOID? Absolutely gross. </p>\n\n<p>He didn&#39;t trust you. He put down unnecessary boundaries. When you didn&#39;t follow them, he sabotaged his own child&#39;s happiness so he could get his way. </p>\n\n<p>I hate saying this on reddit, but I would truly consider divorce. This is not just a mistake and even if it was, he&#39;s standing by what he did. Your son does not deserve this kind of selfishness to have any control of his life. Plus, four years of marriage and he doesn&#39;t trust you to this degree? That&#39;s mad.</p>\n</div>",

I handle everything related to Adam's school. He has a friend (Dean 14) that he started hanging out with a year ago. Dean is an amazing boy and has been nothing but a great influence for adam. I met Dean's dad (Mike) who's a single dad and we'd see each other daily for school pickup/drop offs. My husband kept asking about Mike and pointed out that he's being boundary stompping but I disagree.\n\nUnfortunately, Adam fell sick months ago and had to undergo a surgery. It's been hard but Dean kept visiting, sometimes Mike would come too and my husband would either ignore Mike or make passive comments towards him. Mike picked up on that and I told my husband to knock it off cause his hostility affected Adam and Dean as well.\n\n\nDays ago, I found Adam crying in his room, this was weeks after getting discharged, I asked and he said that Dean sent him a text telling him they were no longer friends and blocked his number. I was confused they were fine. I wanted to go talk to Dean but the next day I found his phone in my husband's car. I confronted him and he said he \"borrowed\" it from Dean but I didn't buy it. After pushing he confessed that he stole Dean's phone at the hospital and sent Adam a text telling him to not contact him again. I asked why and he said it was all Mike's fault for being too close to me and acting inappropriately, and said that he didn't want to directly tell Adam to no longer speak to Dean and chose this stratagy to not make Adam hate him while keeping Dean and by extention Mike away. This hit a nerve so hard I started screaming at him. He said he already expressed how uncomfertable he felt with Mike being around and I kept brushing it off. I said it was because of how ridiculous his argument was, Mike has been nothing but respectable and helpful, I yelled calling him insecure and unreasonable and also cruel for causing Adam heartache with his stunt. He begged I don't tell Adam but I took the phone and returned it to dean and exlained to him and Adam what happened.\n\n\nAdam is no longer speaking to my husband and he is blaming me for telling instead of keeping it between the adults like I'm supposed to.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wish so much that I could help every single one of these women realise they are worth so, so much more than this and that insecure, narcissistic, emotionally manipulative men are NOT worth it. \n\nI feel so bad for OP\u2019s son who has to endure this without any way of protecting himself. I feel bad for OP for having to go through this, but I genuinely hope she sees this as a wake-up call. I don\u2019t know anything about their relationship but I can almost guarantee this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s not your fault or your son\u2019s fault for your husband\u2019s actions OP, no matter how much he tries to blame anyone else or make you feel like it\u2019s your fault or you deserve it \u2014 he\u2019s the one who made these decisions because of the way HE felt. Not you, not your son. Him. He was jealous enough of someone simply being cordial with you that he was willing to crush your son\u2019s emotional well-being and completely upend his life without a second thought. \n\nThis is something that abusers do, they take any opportunity they can to separate you from other people so that eventually you\u2019ll be easier to control. It can happen so slowly that you might not even recognise it with a microscope. Here and there slowly until a few years later you realise you have absolutely no one and nothing except this person who now lets you know that and uses it as a threat, a way to make it that much harder to leave them. \n\nSo if I can say anything here, OP, please reevaluate this whole situation and GET YOUR SON SOMEWHERE SAFE. If your husband was willing to completely crush your CHILD emotionally FOR NO REASON other than his own shallow fragile ego and not have a single concern about it, what else is he willing to do? What\u2019s next? \n\nIt. Never. Gets. Better.",
