        "body": "NTA. My ex had a daughter from a hook up before we dated and his mom was all in on having a granddaughter. At least once every weekend, they went out for a shopping trip. New dresses, new outfits, new shoes, new accessories. Not just frilly stuff, but useful stuff, though maybe more pricey than a normal wardrobe for kids. My ex sent the new stuff with his daughter when she went back to her mom's because unless she spent all day changing, she'd never wear all the clothes at his house. \n\nThe little girl once tearfully confided in me that her mom took a scissor to one batch of clothes because reasons? No explanation, not sure if she objected to the clothes in the bag specifically, was punishing the kid by destroying the clothes, or being spiteful toward my ex/his mom. So my ex made a special effort to send her back in what she arrived in. All hell broke loose after 3 months of no new clothes, despite her mom sending her in increasingly ill fitting and stained clothes. Nothing was legally actionable on either side so my ex resorted to buying all manner of new clothes that referenced him - Daddy's Best Girl, Daddy's Little Princess, etc and those are what he sent home.\n\nYour ex is a complete troll and I would continue to tie dye and maybe mix in some extra personalization. Get a Cricut and add more embellishments to their clothes. Maybe their names, references to you \"I have the world's best mom\" or whatever would really trigger him.",

My ex sent the new stuff with his daughter when she went back to her mom&#39;s because unless she spent all day changing, she&#39;d never wear all the clothes at his house. </p>\n\n<p>The little girl once tearfully confided in me that her mom took a scissor to one batch of clothes because reasons? No explanation, not sure if she objected to the clothes in the bag specifically, was punishing the kid by destroying the clothes, or being spiteful toward my ex/his mom. So my ex made a special effort to send her back in what she arrived in. All hell broke loose after 3 months of no new clothes, despite her mom sending her in increasingly ill fitting and stained clothes. Nothing was legally actionable on either side so my ex resorted to buying all manner of new clothes that referenced him - Daddy&#39;s Best Girl, Daddy&#39;s Little Princess, etc and those are what he sent home.</p>\n\n<p>Your ex is a complete troll and I would continue to tie dye and maybe mix in some extra personalization. Get a Cricut and add more embellishments to their clothes. Maybe their names, references to you &quot;I have the world&#39;s best mom&quot; or whatever would really trigger him.</p>\n</div>",

I love it. \n\nMy girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn\u2019t want to take her favorite shirt over there.\n\nI immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be doing this good.\n\nI was pissed.

Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can\u2019t wear pink tie dye.

Dad can just sell the tie die clothes and get them new ones for the family event lol. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my dads parents would steal mine and my brothers clothes and give them to my cousins (their other grandkids). Now my mom and dad are still together, but his mom hates my wonderful mom. My parents were financially stable and could afford nice clothing for us, while my dad\u2019s brother and sister in law couldn\u2019t afford nice clothing for their kids. They lived with my dad\u2019s parents, meanwhile my parents owned a house. They were always very jealous of what we had, which wasn\u2019t much, but my parents were financially smart and worked endless hours to afford what we could. When my mom found out that our clothes went missing she didn\u2019t say anything, until the day she saw my one cousin wearing my brothers clothes. My dads mom shrugged it off and said that their clothes must have been mixed up when she did the laundry. She told my mom that she would scramble up his clothes and bring them over.  She brought over my cousins cheap ripped up clothes. And man was she angry! From that point on we had a dresser of clothes that were only for their house. It was mainly dollar store clothes or old clothes that were stained and about to be out grown. I remember my mom sending us over in those clothes and my dads mom said \u201cthis is why we like the other grandkids better, your mom is bitter\u201d.  By choice, I stopped going over. No questions asked by my parents and my dad refused to let them force their way into my life. At that point my brother still wanted to hangout at their place and my dad would still visit, but luckily my wishes to not be involved with them when I was 7 was respected.",

There is no world where this is OK.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you don&#39;t have to limit yourself to tie dye, there&#39;s &quot;reverse tie dye&quot; (bleach instead of dye on dark colored cloth) and you can also use fabric paints to make cool personalized items.

What if mom can't afford anymore new clothes because Dad is literally stealing them all? It's not mom your sticking it to, the kids will be the ones left without a thing to wear.

He always complained that he was broke meanwhile he lived in a house with a pool and two cars and we were living fulltime in a 2 bdrm apartment with 5 people, no car, barely money for groceries but he can't possibly help out!",

Instead of thinking &quot;where was I while my son was doing this bad thing? Maybe I should have been watching him.&quot; she just cut his favorite stuffy to pieces in front of him. Needless to say I bought him a new stuffy that was identical. Then I explained to him myself that it&#39;s never okay to damage another person&#39;s property. With words, not &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; that no 5 year old would understand.</p>\n\n<p>Some parents are so gross. If you are in CA the court system would be very favorable to you.</p>\n</div>",
