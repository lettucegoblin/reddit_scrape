And me without my snorkel.\n\nJust wanted to address something: **no,** this is not the **only** life advice I give my kids, and of course it doesn't apply to **every** situation. It's handy at times and helps put things in perspective, that's all.\n\nI'm a professional, yo. Don't worry. I got this. ;)\n\nGot some messages about my book, too, which is harder to come by these days - PM me if you want a hard copy and we'll work something out.\n\nEdit Edit: And amazingly, no, I haven't seen The Wire or Wargames, but now I think I should. Might find some kindred spirits in there.",

She doesn't own the name just because she manage to squeeze her kid out first. \n\nFor what it's worth, my husband is in a family with multiple people with the same name (think John Sr, John Jr, John III + a couple of the same name married into the family) They made it work with nicknames: Big John, Johnny, John John, John Boy etc. So it really is not a big deal. Generally they're all addressed by their name of John. Usually we know who we're talking about or talking to, but whenever the need to specify which one we're talking about or talking to in a group, out comes the nicknames. If we can make it work with 5 Johns in the same family, surely you two can figure it out with 2 Saras or Annas.",

If SIL already had that name picked she would have kicked up a fuss when OP announced it, or at the very least said \u2018oh my, we had the same name picked... do you mind if we both use it still\u2019. But nothing was said. \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that because SILs baby came first she just saw an opportunity to rain on your parade and took it. Good for you for ignoring it and taking the wind out of her sails. She can\u2019t kick up a fuss now because you announced your name a long time ago so now she just looks silly.",

Obviously, he staid with her, as it was just bird shot. She was in and out of the asylum for most of my grandpa's youth, had shock therapy in the 20s/30s  and who knows what else. Now to the Hanks, great gran had 5 sons and a daughter. The youngest boys were identical twins whom she named Hank. Now in those days dads weren't allowed in for the delivery so you have a nurse trying to tell a crazy lady there are two babies she needs two names. Eventually they got Great Grandpa and asked him what to name the other boy. Bless his supportive ass, he chose a name (both middle and first) that were just versions of the name great grandma named the first twin so that she could still call them both Hank and be correct with out one boy feeling like mom didn't love him. That is how I ended up with a Grandpa Hank and a great uncle Hank. Oh, but its not done yet. My father, Hank Jr.",
