No clinic would have okayed her to do a surrogacy for you because she lost a child and that in itself is fraught with issues where she might try to replace her lost child and lost family with yours (without you, obviously, because she's the mom now).  She's throwing up red flags left and right that she's emotionally bound to this child and that once she gives birth, you guys will have her in your lives forever, no matter what.  Do you really think someone who wants to name the baby and have time with it after the birth is someone who is going to sign their parental rights away?  \n\nNot a snowball's chance in hell.\n\nYou're probably thinking: but we agreed, right?  \n\nNo.  As far as I can tell from the wishy washy way you've responded to people, her egg was used, not yours, and your husband's sperm was involved.  I don't want to speculate on how that happened (because, for sure, it was not done in a clinical setting), but at this point, the people with biological and legal rights over that baby are only your husband and her.  You basically naively pushed your husband into having shared custody of a baby and paying child support for eighteen years if she never lets her parental rights go.\n\nAnd all the shit your husband has been doing with her?  The stuff he's been doing with her because he has not, in any capacity, stood up for you or insisted that he won't go unless you're going?  That just strengthens her conviction that she's mom, he's dad, baby is baby, and they're family while you're off waiting in the wings.  I guarantee if you take her to court, she will present it that way as well.  After all, your husband gave her unfettered access to your bank accounts, goes to appointments alone with her, and doesn't defend you AT ALL when she starts making demands that no (actual, legal agreement in place) surrogate would ever dream of demanding.  Your husband needed to put up boundaries yesterday and his attempts at pleading that he's just ignorant is cruel.  \n\nShe might be demanding treatment that she be treated his wife, but he's the one giving that treatment to her without talking to you.  This is exactly the type of behavior bound to create resentment in your marriage when your marriage needs to be at it's strongest.\n\nYou need to get a lawyer, in your state, NOW.  It was stupid of any one in this arrangement to think this was going to work without one.  The surrogate needs her own lawyer to vet the agreement before she signs and to give her a reality check.  You and your husband need to get the same attorney.  Your husband needs to give ALL of his text messages between him and the surrogate to the attorney so that the attorney can find and iron out any potential landmines.  \n\nThere is a very, very strong chance that you will not end up with this baby.  There is a very, very strong chance that your \"surrogate\" will end up with the baby and your husband will end up with a shared custody agreement and having to pay child support.  This is why you don't do \"home grown\" surrogacy agreements.",

More because you and your husband failed to do the proper research to what is required to properly pull of a successful surrogacy.  Depending on the laws in your state, your surrogate could run off with this child and have your husband on the hook for child support.  Because of the lack of homework, you could have ruined your family before it begins and quite possibly your marriage as well. \n\nMy wife is a three time surrogate, but she did it through an agency. She is someone who loves being pregnant but we were done having kids. The next best thing for her was to provide for loving couples who couldn\u2019t have children on their own. This is not an easy process. Her first attempt she was rejected in the initial application process. A few years later she tried again and got through. Less than 2% of women who apply with the agency make it through. \n\nThere were lots of background checks, medical screenings,psychological screenings, etc for both my wife and I before we were paired up with a couple. Each time she did it, we had to go through the same thorough process to make sure nothing changed. The agency setup all the legal stuff and verified the legal requirements for the states involved (our state and the intended parents states).  There is no way we would consider a surrogacy journey without the use of an agency since there is so much that could go wrong. Some states surrogacy is entirely illegal. Some states have really tight rules where it could only happen in special circumstances. We had to sign a lot of legal paperwork specifically stating the child she was carrying wasn\u2019t ours and we we have no rights to the child once they are born.  All of this was handled before the children were ever born.  All the arrangements were handled ahead of time.  The intended parents had to fully fund an escrow account before we got the green light to proceed.  It had been nearly two years since her last surrogate journey and she still gets medical bills from that delivery that she has to send to the agency for them to pay.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound harsh, but stories like this really paint surrogacy in a negative light and there are groups out there who are trying to make surrogacy illegal across the country. In our three experiences they were wonderful. We have occasional contact with the families from time to time. Had an opportunity to visit one child a couple of years ago and have plans to visit another sometime after COVID settles down.  My wife had been a member of many surrogacy support groups during her journeys and some of the stories she heard from cases outside of agencies were horrifying.  Stories like this provide ammo to the groups that want to ban surrogacy.",

All of this was handled before the children were ever born.  All the arrangements were handled ahead of time.  The intended parents had to fully fund an escrow account before we got the green light to proceed.  It had been nearly two years since her last surrogate journey and she still gets medical bills from that delivery that she has to send to the agency for them to pay.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not trying to sound harsh, but stories like this really paint surrogacy in a negative light and there are groups out there who are trying to make surrogacy illegal across the country. In our three experiences they were wonderful. We have occasional contact with the families from time to time. Had an opportunity to visit one child a couple of years ago and have plans to visit another sometime after COVID settles down.  My wife had been a member of many surrogacy support groups during her journeys and some of the stories she heard from cases outside of agencies were horrifying.  Stories like this provide ammo to the groups that want to ban surrogacy.</p>\n</div>",

OP and husband welcomed the scamming because they saw an easy way to get a baby while also saving thousands of dollars. I grew up watch LMN and hell even law and order, this is a clusterfuck and at some point you have to stop feigning ignorance and just admit you deliberately looked away while hoping for the best. They knowingly picked someone that lost a child, skipped out on any type of medical screening and she said they \u201cexplored\u201d IVF but opted for a \u201cprivate clinic\u201d. No reputable clinic would go through with this without medical testing, legal documentation etc. None. On the very slight chance that this is real, they went to some back alley sperm bank, at home turkey basting or the husband and Brittany had sex. OP admits they know nothing about this process which is strange to me, they didn\u2019t even think to google. More thought goes into buying clothing and I\u2019m sure they do proper research before buying a TV. Seven months in she is finally stepping up and saying this isn\u2019t right but she still isn\u2019t going to a lawyer or hell even google, she\u2019s on Reddit asking if I\u2019m the asshole. Stuff like this isn\u2019t something you cut corners with. I would hope if this is real and OP somehow gets this baby they learn to do their research, talk to actual professionals and get professional advice and stop trying to take the easy way out. Surrogacy is a long and expensive process but it is worth it for stuff like this.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Im going to start by saying I think this story is 1000% fake but for entertainment purposes, here\u2019s my two cents. OP and husband welcomed the scamming because they saw an easy way to get a baby while also saving thousands of dollars. I grew up watch LMN and hell even law and order, this is a clusterfuck and at some point you have to stop feigning ignorance and just admit you deliberately looked away while hoping for the best. They knowingly picked someone that lost a child, skipped out on any type of medical screening and she said they \u201cexplored\u201d IVF but opted for a \u201cprivate clinic\u201d. No reputable clinic would go through with this without medical testing, legal documentation etc. None. On the very slight chance that this is real, they went to some back alley sperm bank, at home turkey basting or the husband and Brittany had sex.
