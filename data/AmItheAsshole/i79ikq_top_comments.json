Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John\u2019s parents AND his childhood best friend \u201cDan\u201d and his wife decided to move here as well.\n\nThis past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a \u201cdistanced picnic\u201d at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to \u201cjokingly\u201d rip on him for being \u201cwhipped\u201d and doing \u201cmy\u201d job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be \u201callowed\u201d to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how \u201cmean\u201d I was for not \u201cfixing him a plate\u201d and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families \"do it right\", where they handle the \u201coutside chores\u201d while their wives handle the \u201cinside chores\u201d (including the care of Dan and his wife\u2019s two children). I think it\u2019s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have \u201coutdoor chores\u201d, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.\n\nThe whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to \u201cgo for a walk\u201d and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for \u201cmaking \\[him\\] look bad\u201d in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how \u201ca traditional division of labor\u201d is \u201ca huge part of southern culture\u201d, and how I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his background by \u201cforcing northern culture\u201d onto him and his family. He said he\u2019s been building up a lot of \u201cresentment\u201d the past few months that I \u201cmake\u201d him do half the chores and childcare, since in his \u201cculture\u201d, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.\n\nI was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how \"southern hospitality\" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. \n\nJohn is livid and says his \"culture\" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not \"compromising\" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his \"culture\" was \"Islamic or Asian or whatnot\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some cultures have traditions of victims being forced to marry their rapists, child brides, and FGM.  I don\u2019t care who is around, I\u2019m never going to call those things okay.\n\nAs someone who was raised half southern and half in the south, and who\u2019s wife is southern, I see where he\u2019s coming from.

If you\u2019d married someone from a foreign culture or different religion, you would absolutely still be free to reject the misogynistic and racist practices of that culture/religion! Celebrating cultural heritage does NOT mean accepting every harmful practice that\u2019s ever been a part of that place. For example, if you\u2019d married a Chinese man, it would not be racist or culturally insensitive of you to refuse to bind your daughters feet.</p>\n</div>",
