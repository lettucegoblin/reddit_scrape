I always supported my stepdaughter, much like your father's girlfriend. When my stepdaughter was 16, she moved in with us. I am now \"mom\", her mother is now \"bio-mom\". Her fault, not mine. All I had to do was let her know she was loved, and stand back and let \"bio-mom\" implode. I think what you all have done is wonderful. It's tough having all these personalities and everyone vying for affection. I'm glad your mom is working on it. And that you've been able to cut her a little slack. I wish you well and the world would be a much better place if these blended families could all just get along.",

I seriously teared up, it was so wholesome. \n\nHonestly I think that the way you reacted to your dad's gf was pretty normal, it's up to adults to try and make that connection and establish mutual respect when they're coming into your family unit/space (within reason of course). I'm happy Julia seemed to understand that, and kept showing you her support to earn your trust. And I'm happy you were able to be so considerate, gentle, and caring for your mom despite your difficult relationship, and that she understood your feelings too.",

Now she is my best friend in the whole world and I know she just wants me to have morals and responsibility which as a teen I didn\u2019t understand. My step mom, well she changed when my dad married her and she had her own child. Now I\u2019m pretty sure she wishes I wasn\u2019t around, when before she got married to my dad, she showered me with love and attention. Not saying that is your step mom because I know I would be the greatest step mom in the world if I married a man with children. Mostly because my own experience with a stepmom who showed her true colors after she had her own kid.\n\n  Just wanted to say never doubt your mama\u2019s love. Your story reminded me so much of mine as a teen. So happy things all worked out for you. You seem awesome and blessed with all the love you receive! You deserve it all and more!",

It doesn't do them any good to try teach them that \"mum and dad can do no harm\". When you take accountability, they learn to do the same, as well as when you show patience when they mess up, they learn it too. So if that's the example you're setting for your kids, it sounds like you're a great parent :)\n\nUnsolicited anecdote: I keep a note on my phone where I've collected quotes from reddit along the years, and my sister loves it and uses/wants to use some with my niece (also in advance this is all roughly translated and the gist of things) Some examples:\n\n\"It being an accident absolves you of malice, not responsibility\" -> (context: niece broke her cousin's sandcastle because she was throwing and kicking her new football around in excitement) \"we know you didn't do it on purpose, but it still made \\[cousin\\] feel bad because you hurt his castle he had been working on. Remember when daddy accidentally popped your balloon at a party? You knew he didn't do it on purpose, but he felt bad because he accidentally made you sad? You felt better when daddy apologized. Do you think it would be a good idea to apologize to \\[cousin\\] because he feels sad now?\"\n\n**\u201cThe most important part of parenting is to remember that from here on out, your kids are watching and they will probably repeat the patterns that they learn from you.\u201d** This one I saw for the first time when my sister was pregnant, and she kept it as her phone backgroud for a while so it would \"imprint into her brain\" as she said because she wants to be the best parent she can to my niece (she's amazing, as is her partner). Bolded it because it's my fave/most relevant to this convo\n\n\"When you\u2019re apologizing, skip the excuses and explain that you recognize how it impacted them. People want to be understood more than they want to understand you.\" This I also saw recently, and was just on the phone with my sister and she asked if I'd added anything to the list. She said she'd want to use this (in a kid-friendly way) with my niece as well at some point, as it was a good phrasing to read even as an adult\n\nSorry bit of a ramble, I miss my sis and niece and whole family, covid sucks",

It doesn&#39;t do them any good to try teach them that &quot;mum and dad can do no harm&quot;. When you take accountability, they learn to do the same, as well as when you show patience when they mess up, they learn it too. So if that&#39;s the example you&#39;re setting for your kids, it sounds like you&#39;re a great parent :)</p>\n\n<p>Unsolicited anecdote: I keep a note on my phone where I&#39;ve collected quotes from reddit along the years, and my sister loves it and uses/wants to use some with my niece (also in advance this is all roughly translated and the gist of things) Some examples:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It being an accident absolves you of malice, not responsibility&quot; -&gt; (context: niece broke her cousin&#39;s sandcastle because she was throwing and kicking her new football around in excitement) &quot;we know you didn&#39;t do it on purpose, but it still made [cousin] feel bad because you hurt his castle he had been working on. Remember when daddy accidentally popped your balloon at a party? You knew he didn&#39;t do it on purpose, but he felt bad because he accidentally made you sad? You felt better when daddy apologized. Do you think it would be a good idea to apologize to [cousin] because he feels sad now?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cThe most important part of parenting is to remember that from here on out, your kids are watching and they will probably repeat the patterns that they learn from you.\u201d</strong> This one I saw for the first time when my sister was pregnant, and she kept it as her phone backgroud for a while so it would &quot;imprint into her brain&quot; as she said because she wants to be the best parent she can to my niece (she&#39;s amazing, as is her partner). Bolded it because it&#39;s my fave/most relevant to this convo</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When you\u2019re apologizing, skip the excuses and explain that you recognize how it impacted them. People want to be understood more than they want to understand you.&quot; This I also saw recently, and was just on the phone with my sister and she asked if I&#39;d added anything to the list. She said she&#39;d want to use this (in a kid-friendly way) with my niece as well at some point, as it was a good phrasing to read even as an adult</p>\n\n<p>Sorry bit of a ramble, I miss my sis and niece and whole family, covid sucks</p>\n</div>",
