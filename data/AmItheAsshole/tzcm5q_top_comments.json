You weren\u2019t violating anyone\u2019s privacy. \n\n2) No one puts important documents folded up and in their pocket and then forgets them. I had a six digit code that changed every thirty day for access to somewhere I worked and even that went into my phone. \n\n3) The paper by itself is sketchy. The new closet with the LOCK isn\u2019t a red flag. It\u2019s alarm sirens, flashing red lights and emergency warnings. I\u2019m not usually a betting man, but there might be evidence on his clothes about the misdeeds he\u2019s hiding. Lipstick, hair, etc. \n\n4) DO NOT go through that closet. He freaked this hard over paper. If he catches you or finds out you got in there, it might escalate. \n\n5) People usually put stuff on paper they don\u2019t want a digital, and therefore traceable trail for. You might want to get in touch with your cell phone provider and see what sort of recent calls/texts he might be making. The number might not be programmed into the phone, but the call logs never lie. \n\nINFO: Does he work with chemicals or anything that might reasonably cause any erratic behavior?
