You don\u2019t need to worry about if you\u2019re the asshole; you need to get the fuck out of there, cut contact completely and wait for an apology and an explanation. \n\nNo sane person would attempt to parent a grown ass adult like a 16 year old, especially not when they\u2019re taking your money for rent. Like this whole thing is mind boggling to me. You moved out, got an education and moved back home. Your PARENTS needed you to move in and pay rent because THEY are out of a job and can\u2019t pay the bills, and then have the audacity of pull some shit like that? They don\u2019t need rent money, they need a therapist. \n\nIf I were you I would seriously take a big step back because that kind of behavior isn\u2019t normal and is likely to escalate now that you\u2019re nearby and they think you wronged them. Regardless that\u2019s not a great situation and I would steer clear until you get an apology and satisfactory explanation as to why they think they can do something like that.",

Moving out without even talking to your mom about setting boundaries was rash, especially since they need your help during the pandemic.

I said I\u2019ve gone to the church but as an adult (a confirmed Catholic adult) I told her I could not be forced to go to mass.

I\u2019m a fully grown adult. It\u2019s insane. The amount of times she came tearing through the house screaming at me to turn off my tv and go to bed...Ugh. Also, I worked a second shift job for years before moving home so my schedule was all messed up. I wasn\u2019t tired at 10pm. I was used to getting home around 1am so I would relax and make dinner and do all those normal after work things, just late at night. I wasn\u2019t doing that at her place, obviously, I was just awake, a floor away, in the dark, with the tv on so quiet I could barely hear it.\n\nHuge problem, apparently.

As Covid had his employer change his wages from $13/hr to $9/hr and back up to $10/hr a few months ago. When I know we can find something that at least pays $16+/hr. But my bf is complacent with his current job (he's been there for 13yrs).     \n\nSo who knows wtf will happen. If it has to, I'll end up getting my own place and I'll go back to just being friends with my bf. I just can't live like this much longer.",

I told my parents the day before and got their approval.
