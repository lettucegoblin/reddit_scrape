And if I had some sort of emotional bond to them then I would really want to be there. </p>\n\n<p>Best course of action would be to ask some close family if it is okay to come but don&#39;t demand it and make sure your message asking is understanding if they don&#39;t want you there.</p>\n\n<p>You still were her friend. Even if she was using and if you got her into the addiction she was your friend. I don&#39;t think you would be an asshole for asking. If they let you come then come as a friend, not the person who got her addicted.</p>\n\n<p>If they say no then respect their wishes or YTA.</p>\n\n<p>If they let you come then come as her friend. Not her dealer. Then you can be NTA.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I am open to having a respectful conversation with you, I want to say that up front.\nSo... I do not think anything I said is a broad generalization what so ever.  I have had to deal with heroin and opiate addition in my personal relationships on more than one occasion.  I am not at all trying to be a contrarian or \"dis\" you but I do not like a lot of what you said.  I feel like based on my personal experience and research into addiction I can speak with some certainty on the topic so if you will...\nIf you do not mind my asking how close have you been to someone with a heroin addiction?  It isn't pretty and overdose isn't the way heroin addicts die.  Septicemia and other infection, blood clots, disease from sharing needles such as HIV and hepatitis, cotton fever, risk of shooting up fake heroin (happens more often than you may realize) plus the danger and desperation of the life style that goes hand in hand with addition. I am not saying this because I watched some After School Special, I have lived this. Have you ever taken a friend to the ER because their arm is doubled in size and oozing from their track marks?  It isn't pretty and people need to know!\nIt may be true that 'only' one quarter of the folks who try heroin become addicted but that is a super broad statistic. That is literally just \"in general\" It doesn't take into account the people who try it and continue to have regular access to it.  What percentage of those people become addicts? \n It doesn't take into account the people who over dose and die on the first use either. \nI am certain a portion of the people who try it and do not get addicted are not regularly around heroin or have easy access to it. \nPlus 23% is a hugely large percentage. Do you see that as a small number? It is like would you put your girlfriend on a roller coaster that had a 23% chance of harming or injuring her in some way?  It isn't like .1% of the people who try it get addicted or even 1%.\nI feel your numbers are broad and generalized.\nIt is so tacky of you to say \"people who aren't going to do heroin aren't going to do heroin.\"  Yet another generalization... Everyone at some point is pressured in to doing something they do not want to do.  I am not saying this is the case in OP's situation but please... \nI am sure OP didn't hold her down and force her to shoot up but they were in a romantic relationship and you're kidding yourself if you think his opinion or influence had nothing to do with her trying it.  \nI do applaud OP for getting off heroin and getting his life back on track.  That is not easy to do. He can not change the past so he needs to just look to the future.  Maybe he can use his experience to help those who are struggling with addition or talk with kids who are thinking about trying drugs.  Maybe that sounds cliche but I really there can not be too much education or exposure regarding the dangers of opiate addition.  It is in no way OP's fault she didn't seek more help for her problem or stay clean.  Medication assisted detox and treatment is more accessible than ever right now.  He has nothing to feel bad about there but again he definitely should not go to the services.  \nI do want to say I am no saint and with most things I think there is a place and a time to enjoy them but not heroin or other opiates.  People do not develop a psychological addiction solely to these drugs it is a biological and physical dependency.  You body literally starts counting on the drugs to function properly, when you stop using your body can not function as it should.  Coke, weed and psychedelics are not like this so yeah, enjoy those in moderation.\nUgh, I could go on but I wont.  I just feel like this problem is sooooo extreme people do not even understand until they're personally affected. It is so bade dude.  TBH I am getting emotional so I am going to stop. \nAs I said before there can be enough awareness about this problem.",

He wasn't who shot my daughter up but he was the one who got her started into drugs. He felt such an incredible amount of guilt over her doing drugs and ending up how bad off she was. I had two choices: I could lash out and blame Him, or I could tell him how it was. I told him that my daughter went seeking a certain group of people. They didn't rope her in. She wanted to be there. She wanted to experience drugs and if he didn't give it to her, somebody else would have. It wasn't his fault that she became a drug addict.\n\nI have met many of my daughter's associates and I adore most of them as human beings. They also know that should she die, they can not attend the funeral. It wouldn't be safe. All it takes is one grieving person to lash out and the target is set for blame. I cant even say in good faith that it wouldnt be me. I went and kicked in the door of a drug dealers house once, when she overdosed the first time, threatening to set everyone on fire. I wasn't thinking straight from the grief and shock. \n\n It's a dangerous situation and while friends have loved and lost, the family has lost what was before addiction a long time ago. They've dealt with anticipatory grief and now it's real. It is what gives me nightmares as a parent of a drug user.\n\nHe's not the asshole.

        "body": "As a former heroin addict (depending on who you talk to, you are always a heroin addict, but that is neither here nor there right now), the whole thing is a tricky topic. Part of being an addict and becoming sober/bettering yourself is to stop playing the victim. A common addict trait is that everything and anything seen as negative to the addict is twisted into the addict being a victim. Very few addicts hold themselves accountable for anything while they are actively using. If their mom refused to \"borrow\" them $50 and they got caught stealing by the police, it is the mom's fault in the addict's eyes. \"If you only would have given me that $50 for my \\[insert fake sob story\\] I wouldn't have had to steal.\"\n\nI know many people through NA and other programs that have been sober for years. I can't think of a single one that looks back and places blame on any one individual for their abuse of drugs. Many of us had a \"mentor\" (dealer typically) that introduced us to shooting up or smoking or whatever method of use. The average addict was not forced to be an addict. A gun was not used to force us to shoot up heroin the first time. Spending any amount of time surrounded by other users of drugs like heroin will quickly acclimate you to the knowledge that shooting up heroin feels better and is much cheaper per dose than other methods of use. So, over time your preexisting mental guards against using needles are slowly eroded. As money gets harder to obtain you start to consider shooting up more and more. Then one day you are hanging out with your \"friend\" who has been shooting up for awhile now. You ask if you can try it, usually asking if the other person will do it for you.\n\nThe guy who showed me how to shoot up was hesitant to help at all. He pretty much told me that once I shot up I wouldn't want to take it any other way. I wore down his hesitance and he showed me how to do it. It'd be easy for me to look back and think, \"Man it was all the fuckers fault\". In reality I would have just probably eventually found someone else to help show me or gone to the needle exchange myself to get my own needles and try. In my heart I know that I was not ready to quit at that moment in time, so I would have eventually figured it out myself.\n\nI can empathize with why family members would hate that person though. If my family member died and I knew the person that elevated them further into the hard drug chain I most likely would not want them there either. Grieving the loss of a family member is rough and all rational thoughts can go out the window. Honestly the biggest ire I would place would be directed at the person that started them down the path of hard drugs in the first place. The person that convinced them doing cocaine or smoking crack or heroin was fine. Once someone is already doing heroin they have basically already passed all the barriers of sane judgement already. They are already in too deep to place the blame on solely the person that helped them IV the first time.\n\nEssentially, OP, I would not recommend going to the funeral. Grieve in your own way outside the funeral. If you feel truly guilty then you should use that energy to help others. The best way to show atonement at this point is to help others who are living and going through the struggle. Do not let this destroy your life or sobriety though, especially if you did not force or trick her into IV'ing. It's quite likely she would have went down the path of IV without you, especially if she was already using heroin regularly without your influence. I have had many old friends from those days die and I avoided going to the funerals, even long after becoming sober. Even when the family had no idea I had used drugs with that person, it just wasn't right to insert myself into the family's grieving time.\n\nTL;DR; Don't go to the funeral. Don't let the guilt destroy you, as it is likely she would have continued down the path of IV drug use regardless of you helping her do it the first time. Use your guilt/regret to help others who are still alive.",

        "body": "Someone needed to say this, so glad you did. As tough of a pill as it is to swallow, no one \"gets\" anyone else addicted to drugs. They might offer them drugs, might shoot them up their first time, but unless there is a gun being held to your head, people get THEMSELVES addicted to drugs. Not to mention that the people being blamed here are also in the grips of addiction, not people in their rational minds making rational decisions. It's not like a completely healthy rational person just went and nefariously offered heroin to this innocent girl. It might sound cold, but the girl involved herself romantically with a heroin addict, and when given the opportunity, chose to take the dope. I know that it is much easier to blame the dealer or the bad boyfriend, but no one is responsible for anyone else's drug addiction. No one wants to think that their sweet innocent child would ever willingly take drugs or become addicted to drugs, but the more people keep looking to blame someone else for their loss, the less grieving and moving on they can do. Stop living with irrational anger, no one did this to your friend/sibling/parent/ etc. except themselves and the faster people realize this the better. I would like so badly to have someone to blame for my cousin's heroin addiction whether it be her best friend or her boyfriend but the fact of the matter is she is an adult and i love her but she put herself there.\n\nEdit: i appreciate the silver and gold, ya'll \u2661",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Someone needed to say this, so glad you did. As tough of a pill as it is to swallow, no one &quot;gets&quot; anyone else addicted to drugs. They might offer them drugs, might shoot them up their first time, but unless there is a gun being held to your head, people get THEMSELVES addicted to drugs. Not to mention that the people being blamed here are also in the grips of addiction, not people in their rational minds making rational decisions. It&#39;s not like a completely healthy rational person just went and nefariously offered heroin to this innocent girl. It might sound cold, but the girl involved herself romantically with a heroin addict, and when given the opportunity, chose to take the dope. I know that it is much easier to blame the dealer or the bad boyfriend, but no one is responsible for anyone else&#39;s drug addiction.

The most tragic part about the whole thing was the fact that his family got the acceptance letter to paramedic school three days after he died. He was wanting to become a paramedic. Now he was going to drug court and it was on record that his case manager was a total bitch to him but regardless of that he's still chose to do the drugs that killed him.\n\nNow his family thinks that they have a wrongful death suit against the drug court that he was in. I would never say this to his sister's face because I just couldn't bring myself to do it but I think that legally they don't have a leg to stand on at all. They're just angry that he died and they're looking for someone to blame. While I agree that the case manager in his case should be fired and even prosecuted for not only her treatment of him but for other clients which caused my friend to have to go to jail unjustly because he was dropping clean and this stupid case manager tried to convince the judge that he was dropping dirty, like I said it was still his choice.\n\nYou can't go blaming other people for someone choosing to use. Any time you use a drug you have to accept the consequences of choosing to do so even if that is death. I have not talked to his sister in a long time and this is going to make me sound like an asshole but honestly it's because she became obsessed over her brother's death.

I have looked at her Facebook and still to this day that's all she's about.
