If you give in to him and get rid of the horse (which will then make you the AH) then ask yourself how long will it be until you start &quot;spending too much time&quot; with your friends and family and not &quot;prioritising&quot; the relationship with him. This is just the beginning and it will only get worse. As it stands, you&#39;re young, you have no ties to this boy, you will move on quicker than you think and you will eventually find someone who will support your hobbies and interests and encourages you to pursue them and who will actually understand that a horse is a living being that requires a lot of love and attention. Get rid of the boyfriend before you ruin your life as well as the horses life.</p>\n</div>",

There are good men out there who will understand your need for horses in your life and not try to compete with YOUR CHILDHOOD PET for your affection.\n\nThere's a woman who boards at my barn whose husband is like this. She's miserable, and not just when it comes to the horsey aspect of her life. He controls everything she does.\n\nPersonally, I consider myself lucky to have a husband who is an \"enabler\" when it comes to horses. Whatever I want, he's like, \"sure, we can make it work.\" I do the same for his tabletop gaming. We spend lots of time both apart and together, and he knows the horses are a priority. He was by my side when I had to put down my elderly horse--my best friend--last year. All of this is to say, you don't have to \"settle\" for a man who doesn't understand the horsey life. There are guys out there who will appreciate every part of you, including the equestrian part!\n\nRed flags here, big red flags. Abusers often begin by trying to isolate you from your friends and hobbies. NTA, and run far far away from this guy.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Take it from me, a fellow equestrian--run far, FAR away from any man who tries to make you choose them over your horse, complains about the amount of time you spend at the barn, or otherwise tries to separate you from your passions. There are good men out there who will understand your need for horses in your life and not try to compete with YOUR CHILDHOOD PET for your affection.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a woman who boards at my barn whose husband is like this. She&#39;s miserable, and not just when it comes to the horsey aspect of her life. He controls everything she does.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I consider myself lucky to have a husband who is an &quot;enabler&quot; when it comes to horses. Whatever I want, he&#39;s like, &quot;sure, we can make it work.&quot; I do the same for his tabletop gaming. We spend lots of time both apart and together, and he knows the horses are a priority. He was by my side when I had to put down my elderly horse--my best friend--last year. All of this is to say, you don&#39;t have to &quot;settle&quot; for a man who doesn&#39;t understand the horsey life. There are guys out there who will appreciate every part of you, including the equestrian part!</p>\n\n<p>Red flags here, big red flags.
