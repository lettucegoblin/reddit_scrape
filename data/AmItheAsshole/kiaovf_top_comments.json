Contact the manufacturer of your prosthesis and ask them about repair options. Depending on whether your cousin damaged the polymer elements or the machined metal components, it may be possible to fix it without replacing parts; however, you shouldn't let your father or anyone else attempt these repairs without speaking to the manufacturer and determining the materials and compatibilities involved. If they can't provide parts or service directly, ask them if they can provide schematics for the damaged parts (CAD files are best, if they're willing to let you have them, because they're easy to translate into 3D print files or G-code for CNC machining systems, but any schematics or diagrams are helpful). \n2. If you're covered by insurance or medicaid/medicare, speak to them. I realize that's a hell in and of itself, but you might be able to obtain partial coverage for a repair.\n3. If you have homeowners insurance, ask them if they'll cover this accidental damage. \n4. If all of the above fail, contact [Open Bionics](https://openbionics.com/) and ask them if they can either directly help you obtain repair or replacement parts, or can refer you to another nonprofit that is able to assist. There are a lot of open-source prosthetic and orthotic designers out there (myself included, although I focus more on orthoses right now), and someone in the community might be able to help you. \n5. Barring all that, I'd offer your cousin the option of a payment plan -- with a signed and notarized contract acknowledging the debt and the repayment schedule -- in lieu of being sued. You're far more likely to get your money back that way than you are by taking him to court. \n\nThis sucks, and I'm very sorry you're going through this, but I'm hoping that you can be made whole without needing to put yourself through litigation.",

My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I won a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of money whenever I call my pets \"family\" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection 2 years ago.\n\nI been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.\n\nI saw that it was gone in the morning (he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. \n\nHe realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank \"bro\" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue \"family\" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm struck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll \"raise\" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "This is an outstanding talent and a truly priceless offer! I hope op takes you up on it. I would offer my own services but English is my second language so I believe it will be better from a native speaker. If it was in Swedish I would have been happy to help formulate a very nice and polite and understanding and sincere statement that would shame the receiver to point of freezing their blood with shame. \n\nIf you want some one to accept responsibility for their actions. Do not be angry. They will just become defensive. But if you are nothing but sweet while explaining the consequences their actions had for you, excusing them and being saintly, inhumanly understanding and forgiving... well they have no defense and you can rip them apart with your kind words and brutal honesty. I had a bully. She drove to me to a full suicidal mental state. Our teacher did nothing. I know exactly why. He pretended he didn\u2019t see, that he didn\u2019t understand because it was hard to deal with and just so much easier that way. They stole my life by those choices. The person I was, the person I was supposed to be, the future I could have had. It is no more. It can never be. I am to broken to ever heal. So I wrote my teacher year after. I was so angry, I still am. So I wrote him the sweetest kindest and absolutely brutally honest letter. Explaining in all the vile details what was done to me. All the while excusing him and forgiving him, reassuring him that I understand that he did his best and he just didn\u2019t understand the situation. That I knew with all of my heart that he would have definitely stepped in and helped me if he had understood that it was severe bullying, mental and emotional torture, and not just a small argument between girls like he thought. I knew he was a good person, an honest and honorable person that would never sit by when a child is tortured like I was. I just wanted to help him so he could act the next time. It\u2019s all bullshit, I hate that fucking coward and I want him to suffer like he left me to do. And I did. He will *never* forget this.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is an outstanding talent and a truly priceless offer! I hope op takes you up on it. I would offer my own services but English is my second language so I believe it will be better from a native speaker. If it was in Swedish I would have been happy to help formulate a very nice and polite and understanding and sincere statement that would shame the receiver to point of freezing their blood with shame. </p>\n\n<p>If you want some one to accept responsibility for their actions. Do not be angry. They will just become defensive. But if you are nothing but sweet while explaining the consequences their actions had for you, excusing them and being saintly, inhumanly understanding and forgiving... well they have no defense and you can rip them apart with your kind words and brutal honesty. I had a bully. She drove to me to a full suicidal mental state. Our teacher did nothing. I know exactly why. He pretended he didn\u2019t see, that he didn\u2019t understand because it was hard to deal with and just so much easier that way. They stole my life by those choices. The person I was, the person I was supposed to be, the future I could have had. It is no more. It can never be. I am to broken to ever heal. So I wrote my teacher year after. I was so angry, I still am. So I wrote him the sweetest kindest and absolutely brutally honest letter. Explaining in all the vile details what was done to me. All the while excusing him and forgiving him, reassuring him that I understand that he did his best and he just didn\u2019t understand the situation. That I knew with all of my heart that he would have definitely stepped in and helped me if he had understood that it was severe bullying, mental and emotional torture, and not just a small argument between girls like he thought. I knew he was a good person, an honest and honorable person that would never sit by when a child is tortured like I was. I just wanted to help him so he could act the next time. It\u2019s all bullshit, I hate that fucking coward and I want him to suffer like he left me to do. And I did. He will <em>never</em> forget this. He will never forget me, and he will carry the guilt of his inaction with him. It was a long letter. And I knew that it hit bullseye from his response. I forced him to face himself. That is very painful. Fuck him.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you take this up OP, people deserve the opportunity to reap the harvest that their actions have sown. </p>\n\n<p>ETA: obviously NTA! </p>\n\n<p>This is scorched earth situation!</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I luckily have really good health insurance and also haven't broken anything. So I can't really say. Medical costs also differ drastically depending on where you receive treatment and also the area that you live. For example, my health insurance company gives cost estimates for some diagnostic tests and treatments. It didn't have casts as an option, but I could get an estimate for an x-ray which would be needed with a broken bone. Depending on where you get the xray done at near where I live it could be $60 without insurance or $200-$600. \n\nYou also would have the cost of the doctor appt, any other tests run, sometimes cost of the location, and possibly procedure costs. If you go to an ER good luck. I went once and they only did a few tests. Before insurance I was billed a little more than $20,000. I tried googling and a couple places said $200-$500 for a cast, though I don't know if that's true or not. I also googled the cost to treat a broken leg and between different sites it said anywhere between $2,500-$35,000. Though again, idk if that's true or not and what's been factored into that. \n\nIt's also really difficult to get price quotes for medical expenses. I once needed an MRI so decided to call around because even with insurance paying majority it would still be a few hundred for me. So the cheaper the cost before insurance, the less I'd have to pay since I pay a percentage of the total cost. It was really freaking difficult to get price quotes. Some places straight up told me no they wouldn't give a quote while the others made me jump through major hoops. I think they don't want to give them because they don't want people price shopping and going elsewhere. \n\nI've never heard of people making their own casts before. I have heard of people just not getting medical treatment and it healing wrong. Also, things like crutches or a wheelchair would be another added cost.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that a good amount of people don't have health insurance because they can't afford it. While a LOT of people have what I can disaster insurance. Meaning you have to pay a few thousand dollars out of pocket for any medical expenses (the cost depends on the specific plan) and then the insurance will start to pay some after that, but you still have to pay part of the costs.",
