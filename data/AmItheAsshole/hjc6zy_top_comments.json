It\u2019s that they don\u2019t really care or don\u2019t truly see their partners as equals. They have a certain level of apathy to them. Maybe they are just with their partners because they don\u2019t want to be alone? Maybe in cases like this one, the guy just subconsciously expects to have more freedom/control than his gf and he gets mad that she\u2019s trying to assert herself? Or wants to be an equal?</p>\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some trends and obviously lots of different variables. But it sucks all around. Even totally great people can turn around and expect their partners to put up with more shit than their friends or anyone. I don\u2019t know why people are so blind to it. I try to bring up things with my partner \u2014 but the truth is, if he just doesn\u2019t feel like listening, then I can say anything and it won\u2019t matter until he feels like being empathetic again. Whereas I try to empathize all the time and not be rude even if I\u2019ve had a bad day. Oh well.</p>\n</div>",
