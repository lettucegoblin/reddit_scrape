        "body": "First NTA.\n\nI have dealt with people like these before. There is no amount of explaining and reasoning that will change their point of view. For them you have a surplus and you owe to give it to them.\n\nSo what you need to do is to stop trying to change them, and change yourself. It is hard to put limits and tell people \"no\", because for you it truly feels like you have a surplus. They make you feel guilty about not sharing, etc. So you need to change how you see things.\n\nYou don't have a surplus. Everyone has the same amount of hours during the day. You earn money by using those hours working. Every time that you give them money that they never return and truly don't appreciate, what you are actually giving them is time. Your lifespan.\n\nAlso the money you earn, even if you are saving it, is not surplus. You don't know what is going to happen in the future, you could become very ill, you could marry and have yourself 5 children. Saving is not a surplus, is future managment. You save to buy a house, you save to pay future needs, etc.\n\nUsing money for fun things, is not throwing away money either. You work all day to earn that money. But you are meant to work to live, not live to work. So if the only thing you do is earn money and then get rid of that money instead of enjoying it or use it in some way that brings you satisfaction, you are living to work. And yes you can help them with your money, and you can give to charity and all those things can bring you satisfaction. But is not your obligation to give everything you have to people that demand it and is not even thankful.\n\nWhat you do with your money is your decision. What they do with their money is their decision. But to make it easier, I advise you to think of it as \"what you do with your time\". Because Time is money. So each time you give them, I don't know, lets say 100 dollars. If you make 20 dollars an hour, lets ignore taxes, you are effectively gifting them 5 hours of your life. I know it is not an exact equivalency, but I also know that many of those times you gave them money you would probably have rather rested those 5 hours instead.\n\nYou need to put yourself first, because no one else is going to do it for you. Whatever you give, has to be in your own terms. If they ask \"hey give X money for Y to your sister\". You say, \"oh sorry I don't have the money\". You don't tell them why, or how. The second you feel you need to justify yourself, they won. Any reasoning you give them they will say \"ahh but you can do this other thing instead\". They don't need to know what you do with your own money. Even if you have it in your hands, it is your money, it is your life, no one gets to decide what you do with it but you. I know it is painful when you think your nephews and nieces are going to be wanting. But as long as you keep giving them money, you are enabling them. And they are going to bring more children into the world to suffer, and even if you keep giving them money at one point you won't be able anymore. It is their life, their stuff, they need to learn to deal with it. Not to be tragic, but you could die any day, you could lose your job, you could get married, what would they do then? It is better if they learn to deal with this situation now. They are being irresponsible, not you.\n\nTo be honest, I think is better they cut contact with you. It is really the best outcome, they are using you as an ATM, they are not treating you like a human being with needs.\n\nI think you could apologize if you feel you were a bit overboard with what you said on the party. At the end of the day it is their life, they do what they want, if they are happy, be happy for them. Just don't give them any money. You don't need to tell them you won't be giving them money, you just don't do it anymore, you don't need to warn them or justify yourself. Your life, you do with it what you want.\n\nIf she has 4 children as you said, she has stress in spades, if her husband business is not doing well, more stress, one little argument with you is not going to change anything. They are just trying to guilt-trip you.\n\nEven if you get in good terms with them again, always keep your distance.  So far, for them, you are a human rug, they step on you when they see fit, and they can't understand why would you complain. Put your distance, you are a person, don't tell them everything you do, don't beg them to consider your feelings, they won't. Respect yourself, love yourself. If they follow and respect you and love you cool, if they don't, their problem, you just keep your distance. We don't chose family, it is just a lottery, so it is not your fault, and it has nothing to do with you what they do and how they act, that is on them. I would also advise you to read about people pleasers, that can help you get more tips to deal with their manipulations.\n\nGood luck!",

I think a part of your resentment comes from the fact that you KNOW your sister and BIL can barely sustain themselves as is, but everyone around you is almost viewing things through rose tinted glasses like everything will work out in the end....yeah, BECAUSE THEY KEEP COMING TO YOU FOR MONEY LIKE YOU&#39;RE THE FAMILY BANK THAT OFFERS BOTTOMLESS LOANS. </p>\n\n<p>NTA. In fact, tell them it&#39;s probably best to go NC for a while to preserve your sister&#39;s health. Tell them you&#39;ll be stepping back to make sure of this.
