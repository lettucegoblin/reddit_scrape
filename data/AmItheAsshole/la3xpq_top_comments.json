        "body": "NTA. If he wants to lie to people you might encounter about you, he needs to clue you in if he expects you to back him up on it. It's perfectly reasonable to correct someone who (appears to) assume something about you incorrectly, as long as you don't make a big deal over it (\"oh, we're not married\" isn't rude, it's normal; shrieking \"how dare you, rah rah rah\" would be rude!).\n\nI get it. People make assumptions about relationships based on expected standards (\"not married, just dating? Oh so it's not serious then\"), and he most likely just wanted them to acknowledge your relationship for the commitment it is, regardless of the paperwork, without having to go into detail about his choices and beliefs (especially as no-marriage folk can come off as denigrating marriage in general when they have to 'defend' their position, which can get married folks' backs up and cause conflict). And it avoids the incessant \"so, you guys going to get hitched yet?\" japes that get...old. So, it makes sense he'd lie about it to his coworkers. And it looks bad that they found out he lied, so also understandable he's miffed and wants to Ctrl-Z the convo, as ridiculous as his plan to have you \"j/k lol!\" is.\n\nHe needs to get on board with you being included in things like this. Especially with WFH, you are going to get home and work lives crossing and it is unreasonable to expect you to blank his colleagues if they spot and address you, or to know instinctively what he has told them. You may not be a wife, but you are a partner, and keeping a partner in the dark wrecks the whole team.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. If he wants to lie to people you might encounter about you, he needs to clue you in if he expects you to back him up on it. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to correct someone who (appears to) assume something about you incorrectly, as long as you don&#39;t make a big deal over it (&quot;oh, we&#39;re not married&quot; isn&#39;t rude, it&#39;s normal; shrieking &quot;how dare you, rah rah rah&quot; would be rude!).</p>\n\n<p>I get it. People make assumptions about relationships based on expected standards (&quot;not married, just dating? Oh so it&#39;s not serious then&quot;), and he most likely just wanted them to acknowledge your relationship for the commitment it is, regardless of the paperwork, without having to go into detail about his choices and beliefs (especially as no-marriage folk can come off as denigrating marriage in general when they have to &#39;defend&#39; their position, which can get married folks&#39; backs up and cause conflict). And it avoids the incessant &quot;so, you guys going to get hitched yet?&quot; japes that get...old. So, it makes sense he&#39;d lie about it to his coworkers. And it looks bad that they found out he lied, so also understandable he&#39;s miffed and wants to Ctrl-Z the convo, as ridiculous as his plan to have you &quot;j/k lol!&quot; is.</p>\n\n<p>He needs to get on board with you being included in things like this.

He is likely worried that referring to his long term partner as \u201cgirlfriend\u201d reads as immature to professionals.  He wants all the professional benefits that come with being labeled a married man without the actual commitment and truly, there isn\u2019t necessarily anything wrong with that if you two were at least in agreement.  It\u2019s especially weird he got mad about it.  I think this is one of those things if he makes it a thing, it will become more of a thing rather than just leaving it alone and letting it blow over.",

Because in his head you\u2019re probably too young for him...but he likes appearing to his coworkers like he \u201cscored\u201d with the hot young \u201cwife\u201d. Like he\u2019s got everything figured out, and he probably thinks people are thinking, \u201cHow did he get a girl so much younger than him to marry him? He must be a real catch.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s funny is that when you dump his stupid ass, he\u2019s gonna look like an even bigger idiot when his coworkers ask where his \u201cwife\u201d went and instead of asking \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d they\u2019ll be asking \u201cHow\u2019s the divorce going, since your wife left you?\u201d</p>\n</div>",

If he told me he never wants to get married and then went around and called me his wife To coworkers, I\u2019d be a little pissed and ask wtf we are doing here? So wifey shit w/o actual wifey status? No thanks \n\nYour Bf is working some angle, it\u2019s the only reason he\u2019d want you to go and do something so weird and stupid.\n\n\nEdit: HOLD UP!! Is he wearing a ring to work? I just thought about that? If he wasn\u2019t wearing a ring that\u2019d be a dead give away. Or did he make some lie about that too \n\nEdit: grammar and spelling",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>When young women at work tell me that they don&#39;t want any children I tell them that kids are lots of hard work so if they don&#39;t want them good for them for not having them. I say to definitely not have kids unless you really want them. It&#39;s a commendable thing to take children seriously and to make an informed, considered choice. The assumption that every childless woman will regret having children is to say that all women come from the same cookie cutter. We&#39;re all different. I can&#39;t imagine my life without my kids but it appears that I won&#39;t become a grandmother. That&#39;s their choice.</p>\n</div>",
