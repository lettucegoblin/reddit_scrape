I'm usually quite nice when replying to these posts but I am genuinely horrified on a level that I have never been before. This is ABUSE. Her behaviour is going to KILL your baby if you do not ACT NOW. \n\nMy son is eating around 150mls of formula per feed, around every three hours. He digests formula that fast. You dont even need to do the maths to know that 2 bottles of formula a day is not enough. Your baby is unable to digest what your wife is putting into her body, your baby is in unimaginable pain trying to digest something that her body is not designed to digest at this age. Take your baby right this second and leave. The very fact that you took the time to comment on a reply is awful, you should have read the amount of replies, seen what they are saying and not be sat on your phone reading them for validation. You should have stood up the second you understood the dangers, taken your baby and left. Your wife's feelings honestly just dont matter right now, she is abusing your baby, she doesn't know what is best, she is delusional and needs professional help before she is even allowed near your baby again. \n\nI'm shaking honestly. I stayed in hospital for some time after giving birth, and was seen by a breastfeeding specialist. She explained the importance of not feeding my baby anything else except breastmilk or formula until they are at least 6 months old and the dangers of it.\n\nTake your baby away right this second, if you're reading these replies then it should be clear what you need to do. You need to remove your baby from this abusive situation and help her first and foremost. I understand that your wife is most probably suffering from some sort of mental illness at the moment, but honestly your baby is more important. I dont care if your wife screams, cries or threatens you while you take your baby away. Stand up right now, get your baby and leave. If after reading all these replies you hesitate, then you value your wife's feelings over your baby's needs and that is awful.\n\nI'll say it again, stand up right now, take your baby, leave. It might seem hard but it really shouldn't be knowing the true effects of what this could do to your baby girl. She is more important right now. I cant even give a judgement, it's not needed, what is needed is that you move your ass right now and take your baby away from her, she is a danger. \n\nI just want to scream and curse at your wife. Can you imagine being forced to eat something that you cannot digest, that causes you searing pain in your stomach and on top of all that, you cant get it out of your body? Have some compassion and empathy for your baby first because she is the important one here.\n\nOnce, and only once, you have gotten your baby away from your wife and in a place where she will be properly cared for, then take some time to get your wife to the emergency room for an evaluation, something is clearly wrong with her at the moment. If she is exhibiting unusual behaviour then she is suffering from a mental illness and needs to be helped before you even think about putting your baby back in that woman's arms. \n\nI dont care how much you love your wife, your wife is not being force fed things that cause her literal pain, she can wait, your baby can not. \n\nSTAND UP RIGHT NOW, GET YOUR BABY, LEAVE. \n\nThree simple steps.",

What do YOU do? You know why your poor child is in agony and you allow it every single day to happen.  \nDid you know babies are born with a reflex called extrusion reflex or tounge thrust so they push any food out of thier mouths so they dont choke and inhale it?  \nIt fades around 4-5months, so right around that time you might be able to introduce solids.  \n  \nYour baby is 8 weeks old. Birth to 6weeks is a newborn, 7weeks onwards is considered an infant. Your baby is barely an infant and needs you to step up and help.  \nMaybe it hadnt occurred to you because society has mothers on some kind of pedestal of sainthood that can do no wrong, but sometimes you need to keep your baby safe, even FROM THIER MOTHER.  \nYour wife is in desperate need of investigation of her health, but she is an adult and your baby is helpless.  \nHelp your baby first.  \nI am a mum to a 5 month old girl, id expect my husband to take my girl and go if I had pulled ANYTHING like this.  \n  \nEdit - there is more info buried in the comments rather than the main post.  From OPs updates you have done the right thing (you really have. Well done) but the best you can do now is be completely brutally honest with the crisis support worker.  I was diagnosed with PPA with my girl at 3weeks and yes, I thought if I said my worst fears out loud 'they' would take her away. She will get support and help and it will be scary. But at the end of the day, she will be with or supported by trained medical professionals and bub will thrive.  You will have your family back.",

I have Crohn\u2019s disease now, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the cause, but they know now that babies digestive systems cannot physically handle it. \nI had all sorts of stupid advice given to me by a lot of people, some of whom WERE doctors.

She\u2019s taking \u201cfed is best\u201d to a whole new level. \n\nI want to expand further on the legal aspect of this because it will be harder to deal with in retrospect, but if you WAIT to do something about this, you WILL be looked at equally guilty for allowing the abuse, if not more so because you saw what was happening and were in your right mind, when she is clearly not. My advice would be to call the Peds office and tell them your concern, ask what you can do. Ask for a written statement or a handout about infant feeding/food stages and document everything regarding your baby\u2019s health. \nDocument your conversations with your wife about feeding. \nHonestly it sounds like you are going to need an emergency custody order.",

Now,  if your baby dies from her abuse you are just as liable to be charged because you are aware of the dangerous situation.   Call CPS, leave in the middle of night,  do something but get this baby safe!   Then require she got to therapy before risking your child&#39;s LIFE by letting the mom be around her.</p>\n</div>",

Your wife is abusing your child and this is absolutely a hill to die on. If she doesn't stop, I'd honestly make two phone calls. First to CPS to report her and the second to a divorce and custody lawyer. Your wife is gonna kill or permanently disable your kid and if you let that happen you will be equally guilty.\n\n\n\nNTA but you will be an asshole if you allow her to continue this behavior, even if it means removing the child from her care and not allowing her unsupervised contact with them unless you're certain she can stop abusing your child.",

She might not be recognising it because a lot of people with PPD do love their babies, and they think that means PPD isn't possible, which is not the case. PPD doesn't mean hating your baby, or that you're a bad mum, it just means that you're dealing with one of the many medical effects of the birth process, but many people don't know this fully. \n\nThe early feeding isn't really a common symptom as far as I can tell, but I could certainly see it as both 1) her trying to rush baby into being \"older\"/more personally developed (as she might think this makes daughter easier to connect with) and/or 2) her trying to lean into spiritual \"I know my baby best\" ideology to believe that she already has the connection she feels she's missing.\n\nTell her that you love her, you want to keep your family together, and that to do this you both need to talk to her doctors. Maybe suggest to her that it might be PPD, that she's not a bad person or mum for experiencing this, it doesn't mean she hates baby, and explain that if she's having \"bad\" thoughts, they won't take her baby away. That they're going to help her feel better and stop having those thoughts. Remind her that the doctors aren't going to judge her, they want to help her, including keeping her with her daughter, and helping her feel better mentally (I wouldn't really mention baby's health here as she might see that as blaming, and get defensive). All of this needs to be gentle, caring, and non-judgemental. If she won't agree that she needs help, you'll have to be more drastic, but if you can get her to admit she needs help then she'll probably be more willing to engage with treatment. \n\nThen drop baby off with someone and go with her to the ER. If she needs your help, explain what she's been doing, what she told you about her thoughts, and that she needs help. Support her through getting treatment as best as you can. \n\nSeparately, make sure baby is okay in terms of nutrition and that there are no bad effects from the feeding.

Because of things she did to me as a child and the unnecessary drugs and medical procedures that were forced on me, my teeth were ruined, my digestive system damaged and my organs damaged. I am paying for her shit as an adult. Permanently.What this woman has is a bit different than Munchausen's. Munchausens is where someone  secretly causes harm to a child in order to make them sick so the parent gets a lot of attention. Meaning.... like me, the kid is always in the hospital having procedures for invented maladies.\n\nOP's wife is lying to the doctor, but she's not doing anything secretly. She's doing this crap in front of OP because she thinks she's right. OP's wife is outright and openly abusing this baby. OP should take his baby and get a  restraining order on his wife before it is too late.  \n\n\n\\*Edit for clarification for those who wish to argue that \"they know better...\"  They don't.\n\nTrust me, having gone through this for years, and having this syndrome professionally diagnosed and explained to me.....if this was Munchausen's OP's wife would be very careful to hide it from OP as well.\n\nPeople who have Munchausen's don't ever argue that what they are doing is right, because no one ever knows that they are doing anything. They are extremely careful in hiding everything they are doing. Plus, they don't do obvious stupid things like feed a child edible adult food in front of their husband. That is not at all how Munchausen's works.\n\nInstead, if they have Munchausen's they will secretly slip something toxic into the formula or invent symptoms that the child doesn't actually have in order to get treatment and attention. They are always seen (at first) as a caring, attentive parent who unhappily has a very sick child with unexplained, but constant illness.\n\nUnless some smart doctor or nurse figures out that the pattern of illnesses in the child doesn't make sense and then pursues their hunch? No one knows what the parent is doing to the child except the child.\n\nMunchausen's is a tough diagnosis. Rare, and most often seen in TV shows as a plot line or in the news (very rarely) once it gets bad enough for the kid to die or almost die. Which is why people latch onto this syndrome. It sounds really dramatic.\n\nMy situation wasn't figured out until I was an adult and my childhood records were reviewed to try and figure out why I had so many profound medical issues. The sheer number and types of drugs I was given by different doctors to treat the phony \"symptoms I had\" that my mother was reporting to them started when I was a tiny baby. Some of the things that she and the doctors did to me were insane.\n\nThink: Tonsils out at 18 months. Given Gamma Globulin shots weekly for years, for my \"weak immune system\". Massive amounts of tetracycline for my \"infections\". Overdosing me on orange flavored baby aspirin then telling the hospital when she took me in to have my stomach pumped that I had gotten the bottle and eaten all of them thinking they were candy. Truth: She gave them to me telling me they were candy. I was 3.\n\nAs others here have said PPD is more likely at work here, not Munchausen's.",

I\u2019m a mother myself and thank my lucky stars I did not have to deal with any postpartum mental health issues, I cannot fathom how terrifying that would be along with everything else that comes with having a baby. </p>\n\n<p>This was absolutely shocking to read and of course OP is NTA but I do hope he is able to get himself and his child to safety and get his wife the help she desperately needs. As you said these disorders are not discussed enough for how common they actually are and there is never any shame in getting support!!</p>\n</div>",
