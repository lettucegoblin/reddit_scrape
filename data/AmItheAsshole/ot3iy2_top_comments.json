I think that a lot of the things, at least on this sub, can genuinely be worked out with good communication skills. To me though, it says all of the wrong things for him to behave this way over the situation I hand. \n\nHe's telling you right now that the mere thought of him having to reciprocate the nice things that you do for him makes him angry. He's telling you that he does keep score. And he's telling you that when he's angry, he's going to first act like a petulant child and then twist your intentions. Personally, I would let him go. Because yeah, I do expect things on my birthday. And I treat other people the way that I want to be treated.\n\nNow, I do want to say that there are many people in the world over who don't like exchanging gifts. They don't like to feel like their relationship is based in material items. They don't like a lot of material items. They have other things that they would prefer be done for them to show love. I am not knocking anyone who doesn't like gift giving and feels pressured once they've been given a gift and that's why they opt out of it. But if that's how your boyfriend wants to live his life, he should have established that with you. He should have sat you down and stated his opinion and asked yours and you guys could have created a system that worked for you. And you know if you really want to work it out with him, you could do that. I wouldn't but I don't know him. He could have an otherwise great personality and all the other great traits. You make due with the background knowledge that only you have.",

To me though, it says all of the wrong things for him to behave this way over the situation I hand. </p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s telling you right now that the mere thought of him having to reciprocate the nice things that you do for him makes him angry. He&#39;s telling you that he does keep score. And he&#39;s telling you that when he&#39;s angry, he&#39;s going to first act like a petulant child and then twist your intentions. Personally, I would let him go. Because yeah, I do expect things on my birthday. And I treat other people the way that I want to be treated.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I do want to say that there are many people in the world over who don&#39;t like exchanging gifts. They don&#39;t like to feel like their relationship is based in material items. They don&#39;t like a lot of material items. They have other things that they would prefer be done for them to show love. I am not knocking anyone who doesn&#39;t like gift giving and feels pressured once they&#39;ve been given a gift and that&#39;s why they opt out of it. But if that&#39;s how your boyfriend wants to live his life, he should have established that with you. He should have sat you down and stated his opinion and asked yours and you guys could have created a system that worked for you. And you know if you really want to work it out with him, you could do that. I wouldn&#39;t but I don&#39;t know him. He could have an otherwise great personality and all the other great traits. You make due with the background knowledge that only you have.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "NTA\r\n\nQuestion for the OP: Have you met your boyfriend's parents? Your boyfriend may have grown up in an abusive situation. \r\n\nI grew up in a very difficult family, with high levels of parental control, including: \r  \n\n\n* Social isolation. I was homeschooled and only ever really was allowed to other homeschool families. There was also a lack of individuation between children.\n* Tight controls of media. I was only allowed to consume either \"Christian\" materials or media intended for young children. Only a select few video games, for 15 minutes at a time, twice a day.\r\n* High parental control of things like teenagers' finances. I wasn't really allowed to purchase things that kids in the 90's would have considered inconsequential.\r  \n\r\n\nOne example encapsulates all this. In 2002, I got in a huge fight with my parents. We were visiting family for the holidays, and I was 18.  My uncle gave me a gift card. I used it to buy a VHS of Fellowship of the Ring. According to my parents that was a problem because I bought something that was PG-13, and my sister was too young for it. It was a nasty, brutal fight that lasted hours, and my dad's entire side of the family were subjected to it. \r  \n\r  \nThe only real exception was our birthdays. Those were important to my mom, so she'd go all out. Including comparatively extravagant gifts. Like, for example, a $30 LEGO set or maybe a Christian music CD. For our sixteenth birthdays, my sisters each got a pearl necklace, and I got a Citizen's gold watch. \r  \n\r  \nWhen it came to giving gifts, I became really extravagant, because that was how I thought people normally showed affection. It actually caused me financial trouble at some points because I'd keep a mental tally of what some people gave me and try to up dollar amount to outdo them. The one who spends the most appreciates the other person most. This viewpoint has actually caused some friction in my own marriage.\r  \n\r  \nYears later, I found out that the majority of my family feels really awkward around my parents. I wonder why. I don't talk my parents any more, and it specifically has to do with their fixation on gift giving.\r  \n\r  \nAll this to say, I think your boyfriend may have some similar hang-ups. From a \"reasonable person\" standpoint, you didn't spend all that much; and a gift doesn't typically have any provisos attached. But if he's of the mindset that it does, there's a chance the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. On the other hand, if he grew up in a well-adjusted household, he may have developed that stance for other reasons that are equally unhealthy.\r  \n\r  \nEither way, it sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do. At 21, he's still really young and trying to figure out who he is. He may grow out of this, or it could be the signs of worse behaviors to come. I would definitely be cautious in continuing with the relationship at this point.",

        "body": "NTA.  \n\nAlthough, I had a friend who responded similarly once to a gift I bought her (we were both 18, in 1992).  Got her a (landline) phone with a built in answering machine and a couple other features that cost about $80 because she was wanting one, but she also insisted that I not spend more than $10-15 on one.  I disregarded her and bought her something nice.  And she took one look at it and knew that I spent a LOT more than the specified budget she provided me.  \n\nShe got REALLY upset about it.  I'm not really even sure why, and she couldn't really articulate it either.  No financial issues on her family's side, I was a working college kid living at home, so had plenty of disposable income.  There certainly was no obligation, implied or otherwise, but nevertheless it really bothered her that I got her something nice.  She was having long distance boyfriend issues at the time, so it MIGHT have been related to that... maybe...  No idea.  \n\nI don't know where the headspace of your boyfriend is now.  Either he's cheap or he's got some baggage you're unaware of.  However, your gifts are perfectly in line, with cost, quality, and sentimentality, to be appropriate to someone I'm guessing you've been dating for less than a year.  No, it was definitely not wrong for you to get him gifts.  However, for the remainder of your relationship, I would advise against it.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA.  </p>\n\n<p>Although, I had a friend who responded similarly once to a gift I bought her (we were both 18, in 1992).  Got her a (landline) phone with a built in answering machine and a couple other features that cost about $80 because she was wanting one, but she also insisted that I not spend more than $10-15 on one.  I disregarded her and bought her something nice.  And she took one look at it and knew that I spent a LOT more than the specified budget she provided me.  </p>\n\n<p>She got REALLY upset about it.  I&#39;m not really even sure why, and she couldn&#39;t really articulate it either.  No financial issues on her family&#39;s side, I was a working college kid living at home, so had plenty of disposable income.  There certainly was no obligation, implied or otherwise, but nevertheless it really bothered her that I got her something nice.  She was having long distance boyfriend issues at the time, so it MIGHT have been related to that... maybe...  No idea.  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know where the headspace of your boyfriend is now.  Either he&#39;s cheap or he&#39;s got some baggage you&#39;re unaware of.  However, your gifts are perfectly in line, with cost, quality, and sentimentality, to be appropriate to someone I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve been dating for less than a year.  No, it was definitely not wrong for you to get him gifts.  However, for the remainder of your relationship, I would advise against it.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I have an ex like this. He established early on he couldn't be with a girl who was into getting \"worthless stuff\" and thinking I don't need jewelry or something expensive, I assured him it's the thought that counts, not the price tag. He would request things for his birthday and holidays but never ask me what I wanted because he knew I wasn't \"into materialistic stuff like that\". Even if I told him I wanted things like to spend time, or have him make me a meal, or write me a letter, or color a piece of paper with a crayon, literally ANYTHING to acknowledge it was my birthday/a holiday, or that he cared. Fast forward several years and DOZENS of expensive and well thought out gifts given ON MY PART and I never got so much as a card for a holiday that I didn't buy for myself and lie to tell people it was from him. This was one of the smaller abusive things he did but in the grand scheme of things should have been a warning sign to me from the beginning.\n\nUnless when you asked him what he wanted he told you not to get him anything because it makes him feel there is pressure on him to return the favor and he for instance, doesn't have money to exchange gifts and therefore wants you not to spend any either...it's him making you feel bad so that when your birthday comes around if you DARE TO expect a gift of ANY kind from him you are only proving that all the negative things he said about you(that you were being manipulative, ect) are true. So you can neither desire a gift nor get one from him without admitting guilt and being labeled a manipulative person. When all you did was give a thoughtful and caring gift and should have been thanked and shown appreciation for it even if he doesn't have money to return the favor in kind. \n\nYou're setting yourself up for failure no matter how you handle this situation(and that's how he wants it). If you take the gift back, you spoiled his birthday. If you have him keep the gift, you won't get any appreciation for it. If he gets you a gift for your birthday, he will say you manipulated him into it. If he doesn't get you anything, it's because he doesn't want to allow you to \"manipulate him\". If you want something for your birthday(even just in secret), you will wonder if you ARE manipulative. If you don't want anything for your birthday, you will wonder if you really don't want anything or if it's because he made you feel negative about wanting something(which is a normal thing to do, it's your birthday and it's okay to want things from the people who love you). Either way though, you lose. Because no matter what way things go you are playing in to the beginnings of gaslighting and a cycle of potential abuse. Tread carefully. And do some soul searching to ask yourself if there are other things he does that are hurtful that you accept or justify because you love him/trust him/he had a bad day/his ex did that to him/*insert excuse here*. And if there are other things. Leave now before it gets worse.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I have an ex like this. He established early on he couldn&#39;t be with a girl who was into getting &quot;worthless stuff&quot; and thinking I don&#39;t need jewelry or something expensive, I assured him it&#39;s the thought that counts, not the price tag. He would request things for his birthday and holidays but never ask me what I wanted because he knew I wasn&#39;t &quot;into materialistic stuff like that&quot;. Even if I told him I wanted things like to spend time, or have him make me a meal, or write me a letter, or color a piece of paper with a crayon, literally ANYTHING to acknowledge it was my birthday/a holiday, or that he cared. Fast forward several years and DOZENS of expensive and well thought out gifts given ON MY PART and I never got so much as a card for a holiday that I didn&#39;t buy for myself and lie to tell people it was from him. This was one of the smaller abusive things he did but in the grand scheme of things should have been a warning sign to me from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Unless when you asked him what he wanted he told you not to get him anything because it makes him feel there is pressure on him to return the favor and he for instance, doesn&#39;t have money to exchange gifts and therefore wants you not to spend any either...it&#39;s him making you feel bad so that when your birthday comes around if you DARE TO expect a gift of ANY kind from him you are only proving that all the negative things he said about you(that you were being manipulative, ect) are true. So you can neither desire a gift nor get one from him without admitting guilt and being labeled a manipulative person. When all you did was give a thoughtful and caring gift and should have been thanked and shown appreciation for it even if he doesn&#39;t have money to return the favor in kind. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re setting yourself up for failure no matter how you handle this situation(and that&#39;s how he wants it). If you take the gift back, you spoiled his birthday. If you have him keep the gift, you won&#39;t get any appreciation for it. If he gets you a gift for your birthday, he will say you manipulated him into it. If he doesn&#39;t get you anything, it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t want to allow you to &quot;manipulate him&quot;. If you want something for your birthday(even just in secret), you will wonder if you ARE manipulative. If you don&#39;t want anything for your birthday, you will wonder if you really don&#39;t want anything or if it&#39;s because he made you feel negative about wanting something(which is a normal thing to do, it&#39;s your birthday and it&#39;s okay to want things from the people who love you). Either way though, you lose. Because no matter what way things go you are playing in to the beginnings of gaslighting and a cycle of potential abuse. Tread carefully. And do some soul searching to ask yourself if there are other things he does that are hurtful that you accept or justify because you love him/trust him/he had a bad day/his ex did that to him/<em>insert excuse here</em>. And if there are other things. Leave now before it gets worse.</p>\n</div>",

You don\u2019t have to stay with this man, life is so long, you deserve to be happy.\n\nMy father used gifts as a tool of control.  He would punish us for giving him gifts, so that we\u2019d be confused about what was real life.  If someone else gave us a gift, we\u2019d be suspicious.  If it was time to give someone a gift, we agonize about it and often not participate.  \n\nYour boyfriend could be the abuser, but maybe he is also the abused (a lot of people are both, but being abused is not an excuse for being an abuser).  Someone in his life may have used gifts exactly the way he is saying you did.  Sometimes arguments don\u2019t make sense because the other person is arguing with a ghost in their mind.\n\nGift giving is a way to express love.  If you express love with giving gifts, but he does not receive love with receiving gifts, then you might not be a love match.  And that\u2019s ok!  Life is full of people we can like and love, but a match is more rare.  \n\nIf you want to try to understand (still with the option to run), maybe you can open a world to him where gifts aren\u2019t bad.

Narcissists tend to just go through life thinking like this, where everything, and everyone, is basically just a tool for profit, or emotional gratification. They're generally aware of what they're doing, so they'll often worry that someone might also do that to them, hence the projection, as it's one of the biggest giveaways. They will think of situations as transactional, and view normal behavior in ways you would have never even considered as a path for social leverage, or profit. Their paranoia just gives them away, imo, so it's useful.",

Narcissists tend to just go through life thinking like this, where everything, and everyone, is basically just a tool for profit, or emotional gratification. They&#39;re generally aware of what they&#39;re doing, so they&#39;ll often worry that someone might also do that to them, hence the projection, as it&#39;s one of the biggest giveaways. They will think of situations as transactional, and view normal behavior in ways you would have never even considered as a path for social leverage, or profit. Their paranoia just gives them away, imo, so it&#39;s useful.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Exactly! My boyfriend went to a different state to visit family and asked me if I wanted anything while he was there. I said I couldn't think of anything I'd want. He came back with some chocolate raspberry truffles (my favorite) from a really nice candy store as well as a water gun for my son. I sincerely doubt these gifts were expensive at all, but they did have thought behind them. My son had a wonderful time the previous week watching us squirt water at each other in the pool with a pool noodle, so he got him something that he could squirt water with himself, as he was too little to use the pool noodle successfully. \n\nIt isn't about money or even time, it's about thought. It's about trying to make your partner happy even if it means going out of it way a little. It's also about listening. Op, you listened and got him what he said he wanted and he threw a fit. You say you'd be perfectly happy to just spend some time with him, but he isn't listening. For my bf birthday I took us to do an escape room, then took him to dinner and to get ice cream. I didn't spend a ton of money, but I did take a decent amount of time out to enjoy together. \n\nHaving been in a mentally/emotionally abusive relationship, it really sounds like you've just hit the point where the abuser switches from the sweet and overly attentive person meant to draw you in until you're trapped to the real abuser. They have to make you feel like you've put a lot into the relationship and that you shouldn't want to give it up before they begin the abuse. They have to make you feel like if you just hang in there, they'll be \"their old self\" again, but that was the person that was fake. One instance isn't enough to make me positive that this is what your bf is doing, but if he's started doing a lot of blaming you, if you lately feel like he's saying every argument or disappointment is your fault, even if you weren't related at all, that's a sign that he is abusive.",

I told him definitely not! He was a bit of fun and definitely not someone I could see getting serious with and we had both talked about that very early on. He was extremely relieved and wanted to hook up again. Nope, dude lost those privileges when he acted like a child and ghosted me. He could have simply asked.</p>\n</div>",
