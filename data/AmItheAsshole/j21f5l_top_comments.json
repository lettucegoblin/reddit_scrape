When I bought my first house I was aware (through a friend who lived on the street) that my next-door neighbor had a disabled adult daughter due to a car wreck who was in a wheelchair and had round the clock care. I bought my house out of an estate and I believe the elderly women who lived there hadn\u2019t driven in several years, so hadn\u2019t been using her driveway, and so the neighbor had been using it because it was more convenient than their actual driveway to the room they had added on for the daughter. \n\nFor security reasons, because my house had a detached garage, I had already been planning on installing a fence along the driveway and a driveway gate. I went ahead with my plans, which completely pissed off my neighbors because I cut off their access to my driveway - it was UGLY and they even threatened to sue me (they would have had no case but apparently they were super litigious and had sued everyone in sight after the daughter\u2019s accident).  I was not aware they had been using the driveway when I purchased the house, but even if I had I don\u2019t think that would\u2019ve mattered. My house, my driveway and I wanted better security. It wasn\u2019t my fault they configured their house to rely on the use of my driveway. \n\nI later learned that all along their plan had been to purchase my house for another daughter when the owner died, but they thought the asking price was too high (it was actually a great deal) and were sure the family would eventually come down to their price.  I bought it and they were kind of blindsided but it was their own fault.  So, yeah, the neighbor is 100% TA whether she is disabled or not.  You are not entitled to use your neighbor\u2019s property just because it is more convenient for you!  Oh, and these people had millions from lawsuits related to the wreck that caused the daughter\u2019s disability, so they easily could have paid the asking price!",

Sounds like OP is also trying to get clarification on whether obesity on its own is a disability, or if they may be missing the potential for underlying issues.\n\nThe fact there's no mention of a parking sticker or any other indicator that there is a disability present also provides another possible interpretation: OP opening up the potential that the neighbour may be disabled, not simply heavy, and that therefore not sharing the space is a worse crime than just using what's theirs.\n\nOP specifically said \"I'm not sure,\" meaning they aren't saying one way or another what they think is actually happening. They are only indicating their lack of certainty, not making a concrete statement. It's unfair to assume OP is dismissing the possibility of disability by simply acknowledging/questioning whether it may or may not be at play in this scenario.",

Sounds like OP is also trying to get clarification on whether obesity on its own is a disability, or if they may be missing the potential for underlying issues.</p>\n\n<p>The fact there&#39;s no mention of a parking sticker or any other indicator that there is a disability present also provides another possible interpretation: OP opening up the potential that the neighbour may be disabled, not simply heavy, and that therefore not sharing the space is a worse crime than just using what&#39;s theirs.</p>\n\n<p>OP specifically said &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; meaning they aren&#39;t saying one way or another what they think is actually happening. They are only indicating their lack of certainty, not making a concrete statement.

Then after experiencing weird symptoms for a while (and being in denial/telling myself I probably just hurt myself at the gym, until it got to the point where one day I couldn't get out of bed without help), I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and put on massive doses of steroids so I got all fucking puffy and was in so much pain I could barely move. The shock of going from being super fit to diminished mobility made me extremely depressed and the meds made me gain weight. The depression sapped my motivation to do ANYTHING for a while. I'm doing much better now (no more steroids but on treatment that helps immensely) and able to move/work out again (not to the level that I used to, but hey, I'll take what I can get) but I understand how someone can get sick/gain weight due to medical reasons and then depression sets in and exacerbates it.

My biggest fear is that I'll have a flare up and meds won't be able to get it under control and I'll be disabled and have assholes thinking, \"Well, she LOOKS fine.\" I've already gotten the \"you're young and healthy\" from about 5 doctors prior to my diagnosis when I literally couldn't get in and out of a car unassisted.

That&#39;s gross.</p>\n\n<p>And I agree, too- walking is great exercise! ...For people who can do it. Don&#39;t assume you know what someone is capable of. There are disabilities that make walking painful. There are disabilities where walking too much can mess with your heart to the point where it just suddenly stops. Just because you can&#39;t see how something is affecting someone doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re fine and pretending to be disabled. </p>\n\n<p>Again- it&#39;s possible the neighbor is just fat and lazy and entitled. It&#39;s also possible she has a legitimate disability and is really struggling. Does it mean she&#39;s entitled to the parking spot? No. Does it mean she&#39;s entitled to demand things? No. But I think everyone IS entitled to at least some empathy, and to people not making the worst possible assumptions.</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t see the OP saying that at all. In fact, OP seems to have sympathy for the fact that the neighbor took 30 minutes to walk a distance that OP identified usually takes 5 minutes, that the neighbor was heavily sweating both times, that the neighbor complained about the pain in her ankles, and that he has sympathy the neighbor. I don&#39;t see where OP has said that the neighbor is lazy.</p>\n\n<p>OP has strategically used &quot;disabled&quot; in quotes because although the neighbor is not, technically, disabled, OP recognizes that the neighbor has mobility difficulties. In fact, OP is granting the neighbor somewhat disability status, not taking disability status away!</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, OP was getting fed up with the neighbor stealing her driveway, had the neighbor&#39;s car towed away and put up a fence. Now OP is having second thoughts and is concerned that she may be TA. Doesn&#39;t sound like OP is being the asshole at all, here.</p>\n</div>",
