It really sounds like these people are doing their best to be cut out of this child\u2019s life. Who acts like this towards a family member? It\u2019s truly unbelievable.</p>\n</div>",

In order to admit that their employee is making their life easier, they have to admit that they aren&#39;t doing everything and not the lynch-pin most important person of the company. They have to admit they aren&#39;t the hardest worker. </p>\n\n<p>This is virtually impossible for some people because they equate value with hard working, and so they have to be the most valuable and therefore hardest working. To compensate for the insecurity, they&#39;ll probably be more likely to belittle the actual hardest worker to try to devalue their work to make it seem they aren&#39;t working harder than they are.</p>\n\n<p>This is a common phenomenon, especially in businesses still run by the founder, and especially in America with it&#39;s brand of Prosperity Gospel, where money is equated with hard work. In order to be paid more, you have to be the harder worker.</p>\n</div>",
