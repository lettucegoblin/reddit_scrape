There&#39;s a risk of harm and danger from him and his family.\nForget couple&#39;s therapy, Jim needs serious therapy himself. That is a lot of rage and hate inside of him that led him to react that way and that needs to be addressed and dealt with before he comes anywhere near you and your daughter.\nI would go so far as to save those posts and pictures and apply for a restraining order, and get full custody. </p>\n\n<p>You are right to fear for your safety and your daughter&#39;s  He trashed the nursery, dragged your name (and really his own daughter too) maliciously through the mud. You were able to prove your innocence this time...what if you couldn&#39;t next time? What then?\nAnd what if instead of an inanimate object....he directed that rage at you? Or at your daughter?\nI hope you&#39;re with people that support you and your daughter. And really, hope you&#39;re able to distance ties with Jim. All the best.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Thanks for the update. I have the feeling that you are writing in because you are questioning your resolve as they have apologised and now want everything to go back to the way it was. I can understand their position, illogical and toxic as it may be. I just wanted to point out some things from your post that can help with your resolve.\n\n1. He cheated, and I'm sure he is using this to explain his bad behaviour. He is explaining how he did it to boost his ego after a bad breakup. That it weighed on him and created a paranoia that the same thing could happen to him. And that explains his actions. It also condemns them. He set the standard for what he considers acceptable for cheating, cutting the person off, destroying and giving away property, sledging them to other people and holding a grudge forever. If you had in fact cheated he would still being calling you a welfare princess, he would still be making life hard for you every time he saw you. But he does it to you, and uses it as a reason for you see his terrible actions in a better light and to being more open to forgiving him! I'm sure he says \"I was terrible, forgive me\" but then later uses it as an explanation for his later behaviour. It probably feels unfair to accuse him of using it as an excuse because he shit sandwiches with an apology. This tactic is illogical. It explains his emotional state, it does not excuse it, at all, one iota. It makes him a worse person. He is a hypocrite. A cheater. And someone capable of all the evil from your original post. Before he was just the latter, now the list has become a whole lot longer on why he is a bad person to be in a relationship with. This should make you more resolved to divorce him, not less. This should be another thing you'd want to overcome in couples counselling should you have decided to forgive him. Make sure you don't let him spin this story so that he uses it as a way to excuse his behaviour. It's another thing he should beg forgiveness for.\n2. As for his family, toxic families tend to dictate when you should forgive. \"I said sorry, you can't hold a grudge forever\". Whilst actually holding a grudge forever when they feel like it - I'm sure they're not quick to forgive when they've been wronged. A healthy dynamic is to find ways to help that person forgive you earlier, to take opportunities to rebuild trust, to own your bad behaviour, repeatedly, vocally, not just to the person you wronged but to the broader social group. And it hasn't been that long, we aren't even talking a year yet, doing rough numbers and estimates, your baby is about 9 months old, for about 5 of those months they behaved in an appalling manner. You have had at most four months to try and 'get past' behaviour that would normally have someone blocked out of your life for good. Don't let anyone guilt you or trying to forgive earlier than you think is healthy, and to be honest I would support that as a mother you limit their interactions severely to only supervised in areas that you feel comfortable until your child is at an age where they can tell you if they are being inappropriate. It sounds like your ex comes from a toxic as all hell family, I wouldn't want that rubbing off on my child if I could help it.\n3. Divorce seems like a good logical choice for the wellbeing of your child. At the moment you seem to be onto a very good thing, she has a stable upbringing with her maternal grandparents and an engaged mother. She has regular visitations with her father. She is shielded from family that I wouldn't think to be a positive force in her life, at most they are selfishly wanting a connection, I would not expect them not to complain about you to your child and undermine that stability. You also provide your daughter with a strong role model on what a woman should and should not accept in a relationship. I think returning to your marriage could put your child at risk to normalise that husbands cheat on wives, that it's ok to go nuclear on someone when they hurt you (even if it's the same thing you did), that's is ok to rugsweep bad behaviour because you have a good story to explain it away. I think that would set your daughter up to date men very much like her father, cheaters, abusers, liars. And it was abuse. Your stuff was thrown on the street, you were harassed. That's not a 'normal' I would allow into my child's life and I would fear they would take it with them, and pass it onto the next generation. What you choose for your daughter affects your grandchildren who have not been born yet (should she choose to have children), I would be very particular on her best interests, followed by your healthy emotional state, that of her fathers and her extended family's happiness would not even be on my radar.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for the update. I have the feeling that you are writing in because you are questioning your resolve as they have apologised and now want everything to go back to the way it was. I can understand their position, illogical and toxic as it may be. I just wanted to point out some things from your post that can help with your resolve.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He cheated, and I&#39;m sure he is using this to explain his bad behaviour. He is explaining how he did it to boost his ego after a bad breakup. That it weighed on him and created a paranoia that the same thing could happen to him. And that explains his actions. It also condemns them. He set the standard for what he considers acceptable for cheating, cutting the person off, destroying and giving away property, sledging them to other people and holding a grudge forever. If you had in fact cheated he would still being calling you a welfare princess, he would still be making life hard for you every time he saw you. But he does it to you, and uses it as a reason for you see his terrible actions in a better light and to being more open to forgiving him! I&#39;m sure he says &quot;I was terrible, forgive me&quot; but then later uses it as an explanation for his later behaviour. It probably feels unfair to accuse him of using it as an excuse because he shit sandwiches with an apology. This tactic is illogical. It explains his emotional state, it does not excuse it, at all, one iota. It makes him a worse person. He is a hypocrite. A cheater. And someone capable of all the evil from your original post. Before he was just the latter, now the list has become a whole lot longer on why he is a bad person to be in a relationship with. This should make you more resolved to divorce him, not less. This should be another thing you&#39;d want to overcome in couples counselling should you have decided to forgive him. Make sure you don&#39;t let him spin this story so that he uses it as a way to excuse his behaviour. It&#39;s another thing he should beg forgiveness for.</li>\n<li>As for his family, toxic families tend to dictate when you should forgive. &quot;I said sorry, you can&#39;t hold a grudge forever&quot;. Whilst actually holding a grudge forever when they feel like it - I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not quick to forgive when they&#39;ve been wronged. A healthy dynamic is to find ways to help that person forgive you earlier, to take opportunities to rebuild trust, to own your bad behaviour, repeatedly, vocally, not just to the person you wronged but to the broader social group. And it hasn&#39;t been that long, we aren&#39;t even talking a year yet, doing rough numbers and estimates, your baby is about 9 months old, for about 5 of those months they behaved in an appalling manner. You have had at most four months to try and &#39;get past&#39; behaviour that would normally have someone blocked out of your life for good. Don&#39;t let anyone guilt you or trying to forgive earlier than you think is healthy, and to be honest I would support that as a mother you limit their interactions severely to only supervised in areas that you feel comfortable until your child is at an age where they can tell you if they are being inappropriate. It sounds like your ex comes from a toxic as all hell family, I wouldn&#39;t want that rubbing off on my child if I could help it.</li>\n<li>Divorce seems like a good logical choice for the wellbeing of your child.

Destroying property and spreading misinformation about you that casts you in a negative light, are all early steps of Domestic Abuse and possibly Violence.\n\nSecondly, you\u2019ve never done anything to make Jim question you as far as you\u2019ve stated, so excusing this behaviour seems like a huge leap for you to make. *Can* you even forgive this ? I understand you want what\u2019s best for your child, but is you in a relationship with someone like Jim actually what\u2019s best for your child ? Would co-parenting be an option you can see going well instead ?\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier for people on the internet to espouse their opinions than it is to follow through with in real life, I understand.

He said, \"Get an abortion or I'm gone.\"\n\nWe had already discussed (as one ought) possible reproductive mishaps. And while I'm all for abortions for anyone who wants one, it ain't my jam. He accepted these risks. \n\nI told him THIS was HIS abortion. I would fuck off, and he could pack his shit and RTM (return to mommy) and I would disavow all knowledge of him, feign ignorance of even potential names to put on a birth certificate, and claim entire platoons of possible lovers to track down and test if pressured for a father. But do STAY fucked off. \n\nThen I called my cousin and she and I went to visit my uncle. \n\nMy dear old uncle. The old billy goat. Who still couldn't (at the time, he dead now) enter the states due to some... erm... FLQ shit... who had left his wife of 15+ish years wins before for my aunt... herself 15+ish years old. Legit, she got installed as a chef de famille in a home with a teenaged stepdaughter who was *older than she was.*\n\nBut she did end up spending a good 15+ years herself with him... until they broke up and she ran off to the mountains with her 20yo bf, lol... the point is at that time they had two kids. \n\nBut being an older man with adult and near adult kids, my uncle was NOT keen on more kids. He *refused* to sign the birth certificates. And through giggles, told me all about when cousin was born: how he stayed in the waiting room, as men did back then, and then they rolled out a little tater-monkey and declared it his. He followed to the nursery and watched this kid get darker... and darker... and darker. \n\nTHAT BITCH!! ILL KILL HER!!\n\nAs security was wrestling him to the floor a black gentleman entered the nursery viewing area and calmly informed him that he had been watching someone else's child (his, go figure) darken up post birth. HIS baby was that white kid over there. \n\nOH. \n\nA decade and a half later, when my aunt finally called it quits, he explained to me that that refusal to sign the certificates finally bit him in the ass. The laws were different back then. No assumption of parental duties was given him, they were NOT his kids. So she had him over a barrel with what was by then, his greatest treasures and joys. \n\nGo forth. And know that even for all this tomfuckery, it is still not as fucked up a story as this other one, and that he will spend a significant portion of his life bent over a barrel. \n\n(On a personal note, my oldest knows this entire story and loves it, much to my now-exes utter chagrin. 20+ years from now, you'll get to watch your ex cringe as his kid crows, \"But get this part, he dragged my mom through the mud, disavowed me, threw out all my baby shit and acted the utter fool... because he had no idea he was black.\"",

You are under no obligation to tie yourself into knots to make HIM feel better, when YOU are the one who has been damaged.</p>\n\n<p>And all because he did not STOP TO THINK BEFORE HE ACTED.</p>\n\n<p>Please, for yourself and because you are worth it, get a counselor and a family lawyer ASAP.  The counselor to let you work through the trauma that he inflicted on you, and the family lawyer to divorce his sorry ass.  If you have the mental bandwidth, please check in with us in a few months and give an update.</p>\n</div>",
