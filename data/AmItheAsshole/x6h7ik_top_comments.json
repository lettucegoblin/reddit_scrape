Once you filed a police report, and he knowingly stood by while that happened, then he became a criminal.  He stole an item worth 7k from your son.  That&#39;s grand theft, a felony charge.  And he&#39;s admitted his guilt in the matter.  Can you have the police reinstate the charges? </p>\n\n<p>Your husband has shown an appalling lack of remorse for his behavior and seems to think he knows better than you what you should do with your money.  That&#39;s a major red flag for controlling behavior.  Not only that, he&#39;s driven a wedge between you and your son.  Another red flag.  How long have you two been married and how long has he tried to tell you what to do with your money?  You need to ask yourself some questions about this relationship.  Do you want a divorce?  Probably not.  Yet that might be the best solution for you unless your husband has a serious change in his outlook.</p>\n</div>",

Someone who thinks your property is his to dispose of as he wishes? And even worse, that your adult son\u2019s belongings are somehow also his to do with as he pleases? Now pair that together with the fact that he\u2019s LIED TO YOUR FACE. If he can lie so easily about this, what else is he capable of lying to you about? How can you ever again trust someone who\u2019s lied to you??\nI would guess your son isn\u2019t speaking to you because you didn\u2019t press charges against your husband for his theft and if that\u2019s the case then he\u2019s ENTIRELY CORRECT. This was not only a major breach of boundaries but also an actual, physical, real CRIME. Seriously, you need to decide if you\u2019re choosing your husband or your son, because you\u2019re not keeping both. \n\nYour husband FAFO\u2019d. If he didn\u2019t want to FO, he shouldn\u2019t have FA. You should tell him that too. Or \u201cdo the crime, do the time\u201d works too. Altho it sounds like he got let off a little too easily this time and therefore hasn\u2019t done the time.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. If it was another kid who did this to your son, would you even be questioning whether or not it was right to involve the cops? Because if it was another teen you\u2019d want to make sure he understood that there are consequences to poorly considered actions, and you\u2019d consider that a service done to him because adults who make it to adulthood without ever facing \u201creal\u201d consequences for their actions ever tend to make poorer choices and then wind up in much hotter water because they should have \u201cknown better\u201d. So like, consider this a service you\u2019ve done for your husband. Now he knows that real actions have real consequences. If he\u2019s smart he might even learn something from it.\n\nNow the real kicker that you haven\u2019t considered is this. What ELSE could have been done to deal with safety concerns around young men on crotch rockets? Because as soon as you start thinking about ways to address his \u201csupposed\u201d concerns (safety), you realize real damn quickly that there were tons of good and viable and actually LEGAL ways to help your son ride his bike safely. Training courses, equipping him with proper gear if he isn\u2019t already (you want the professional grade leather stuff, road rash is very bad), other safety equipment, educating yourself on actual motorcycle etiquette, riding WITH him, asking him to ride with friends anytime he\u2019s outside the city/further away from immediate medical assistance should anything happen, gps tracker for long trips, just TALKING to him about your safety concerns in a calm and rational manner. And so on. Like. This wasn\u2019t about \u201csafety\u201d, it was about your husband\u2019s control over you.",

He **knew** where the motorcycle was and knew you **believed** the bike was stolen, and he LET YOU FILE A POLICE REPORT ANYWAY. Then you found out where the bike was, and he refused to return it. If he's against this motorcycle, I'm assuming that his name's not on the title-- which means that he withheld the motorcycle from the lawful owner.\n\nHe should be livid. He should be livid that he was taken to the station because he allowed you to file what some jurisdictions might consider a false police report. (I realize that he hid the bike without your knowledge, and you filed the police report in good faith; I'm just saying that things happen and the police will believe what they will believe-- which could include that this was some type of scam between a couple to get an insurance payout.) He should be livid that he put you in the position of possibly being in hot water with the authorities for potentially filing a false police report.
