As high as 80% of children in the underage sex trade in the US are foster kids taken from the system. A lot of foster parents will sell the kids for money and since theres no oversight no one notices for years.. if ever. And when they do there are no penalties. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are the religious foster families, the ones in it for money, the ones that beat the children, and ones that fight reunification so that they can adopt for their own selfish gains. Foster care fucks you up. Its filled with rape, abuse and neglect. These people who cant decide if you&#39;re the asshole have no idea.</p>\n\n<p>Looked up the Hart Family. They just murdered their six black foster kids because they were crazy racists.  Look on <a href=\"/r/ex_foster\">r/ex_foster</a> </p>\n\n<p>Its bleak and it&#39;s not getting better. Do not let anyone you love go through that. </p>\n\n<p>NTA.</p>\n</div>",

Kids need to come first. But you need to be real with yourself for your brothers sake and own your failing marriage and either fix it or if it ends, take responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can't let your brother go into foster care you need to man up and be an adult. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis fight is silly. You and your wife don't need to play parents but you need to be the best brother in the world. She loses privacy and gains a new, close sibling. Most of the issue is you acting the martyr.

So, either this wasn&#39;t a sudden change due to your mothers death, or your timeline is off. </p>\n\n<p>Also like, how old are you? Assuming you&#39;re 26, they had the kid right when they got remarried. Either way, that would mean (assuming your parents were faithful during the marriage) those siblings are (at most) 23. Which is a ridiculous age for someone to take in a 6 year old. 26 is also pushing it. Have you considered your financial state? Do you have an actual home or an apartment? What&#39;s the school district like? Health Insurance? Etc.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Are there grandparents? Aunts? Uncles? Foster care isn&#39;t the only option left. I don&#39;t know how old your parents are but if they have a 17 year divorce, and older children I don&#39;t really understand how they also had a 6 year old with no grandparents or other older generation family members, especially if your mother was in prime age for a heart attack.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;m a big believer that you are not obligated by blood, but this man wants to take care of his brother despite not wanting to have children due to a messy childhood. His wife is justified in being upset as her whole life got turned upside down, but so did his and his brother&#39;s. I hope the conversation at least included &quot;...but I hope you stay&quot;.

He was a very troubled kid, but she had just lost her brother unexpectedly and felt she needed to help this kid. Started the entire process without telling her husband of 14 years. 2 weeks before they were scheduled to have their home visit, she finally told him. It went basically like...this is happening, you can stick around and help, or I&#39;ll do it without you. My FIL is a good dude, and said &quot;I would be a complete asshole to say no to the kid who&#39;s never had a home&quot;. Let&#39;s just say it was an awful 18 months. Kid got sent back to his home state, and my in laws are divorced and really don&#39;t like each other. And it completely messed up my kids lives too.</p>\n</div>",

If she doesn&#39;t want to deal with that she has an out.</p>\n\n<p>How would including her on the decision/discussion even work? He was always going to adopt. It&#39;s like you coming over to me with a problem and not caring what I&#39;d say because you already know what you are going to do. That&#39;s annoying and downright disrespectful. He did the best of a shitty situation. Saved his brother and gave an out to his wife of she doesn&#39;t want to deal with this. She&#39;s allowed to be pissed because that&#39;s not what they initially thought they were getting themselves into but other than that there is nothing anything to be angry at. Definitely doesn&#39;t make him an asshole. It makes him the opposite of an asshole. He is potentially sacrificing his own happiness(if the wife doesn&#39;t want to stay) so that his brother doesn&#39;t have to go into foster care.</p>\n</div>",
