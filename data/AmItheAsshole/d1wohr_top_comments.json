Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.\n\nThey said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.\n\nAnyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open\n\nMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. \n\nSo I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\n\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\n\nAITA for what I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't ever mention it at his house or try to demean him over his choices, I just don't want to deal with it at my house. I know not everyone has my same habits, I shower at least twice a day on top of changing clothes regularly. \n\nAs a parent as well, I do agree with their statement that they do get to take your car away, but I applaud you calling their bluff so wonderfully. My oldest son likes to test his limits, so I have to be rather explicit in my setting of rules. There have been a few times where he has avoided any real punishment because he knows he was \"technically\" correct. \n\nHold your ground, don't be disrespectful, and keep up your hard work.

I don&#39;t ever mention it at his house or try to demean him over his choices, I just don&#39;t want to deal with it at my house. I know not everyone has my same habits, I shower at least twice a day on top of changing clothes regularly. </p>\n\n<p>As a parent as well, I do agree with their statement that they do get to take your car away, but I applaud you calling their bluff so wonderfully. My oldest son likes to test his limits, so I have to be rather explicit in my setting of rules. There have been a few times where he has avoided any real punishment because he knows he was &quot;technically&quot; correct. </p>\n\n<p>Hold your ground, don&#39;t be disrespectful, and keep up your hard work. Congratulations on purchasing your own car as well, glad to hear there are still kids out there who work to get something for themselves.</p>\n</div>",

If you go about this at the right angle, you may be able to really help you brother, people who dont keep good hygiene arent exactly living it up in the self esteem and confidence department, he probably has a harder time coping with home life than you do. Going shopping with him to pick out some deoderant and shampoo and body wash he likes could be a great start and go a long way, as well as suggesting he shower at night before he goes to bed if he doesn't want to wake up to do it in the morning, and this ones up to you but it would really show you want to help him, do his laundry for him, maybe not forever but at least at first, or make sure he knows how to use the washer and dryer. And if your parents find a way to complain about any of this or hinder it, then they are definitely shitty parents.",

Very proper in every way. She requested that any adults that would be around her kid should do their utmost to speak without contractions and with proper grammar. Hygeine is also very strict there (my niece said they had to brush their teeth 8 times one day when she was over there and wash for a minimum of 30 seconds)\n\nI've noticed her friend does not wash her hands when she comes over and her mom isn't around. The water connection to the sink is pretty loud and you can hear if the sink turns on. At first I didn't know her well enough to question her if she washed her hands, but eventually I started \"reminding her\" to do it.\n\nIt just seems like a habit that takes a long time to get ingrained into kids. Honestly it sickens me how many adults don't do it either. At work I'd wager maybe only 50% of the guys wash their hands after peeing. The topic came up one day when I was talking to a female coworker and she said, \"OMG it is just as bad with the girls! Someone from the office down the hall changed her tampon and didn't wash her hands after.\"\n\nI just try not to think about it.

Honestly it sickens me how many adults don&#39;t do it either. At work I&#39;d wager maybe only 50% of the guys wash their hands after peeing. The topic came up one day when I was talking to a female coworker and she said, &quot;OMG it is just as bad with the girls! Someone from the office down the hall changed her tampon and didn&#39;t wash her hands after.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I just try not to think about it. I figure as long as I was my hands properly I&#39;m fine, even if others do not.</p>\n</div>",

He was a super nice dude but I felt so bad for him. He'd walk to class and sit down and you could hear him gasping for breath as his lungs struggled to keep up. He walked on the sides of his feet, which seems counterinuititve but apparently it is common with people that overweight.\n\nAnyways, he was big enough that I don't think he could possibly have properly cleaned out every fold on his body easily. He did not take showers often (you could tell if he hadn't showered lately because his hair would get more oily each day, when he showered it was light and fluffy for a day or two). I'm guessing part of the reason was that showering was probably a lengthy process if he wanted to fully clean himself properly.\n\nHe smelled so bad. It wasn't traditional BO smell though. It legitimately smelled like someone took a bunch of cheetos, onions, and yeast and put them in a sealed jar outside in the sun for a few weeks. Essentially a moldy artificial oniony cheese yeast smell. It was pungent and would linger for a long time. You could tell if he had just been in a building after you walked in.\n\nI still feel bad for him. He graduated but all I can think of is that his life is not going to be very long if he doesn't lose weight. He can barely walk at 22 and I wouldn't be surprised if he has infections on his skin. Whenever I think of him I hope he gets the support and motivation to lose weight.",

He walked on the sides of his feet, which seems counterinuititve but apparently it is common with people that overweight.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, he was big enough that I don&#39;t think he could possibly have properly cleaned out every fold on his body easily. He did not take showers often (you could tell if he hadn&#39;t showered lately because his hair would get more oily each day, when he showered it was light and fluffy for a day or two). I&#39;m guessing part of the reason was that showering was probably a lengthy process if he wanted to fully clean himself properly.</p>\n\n<p>He smelled so bad. It wasn&#39;t traditional BO smell though. It legitimately smelled like someone took a bunch of cheetos, onions, and yeast and put them in a sealed jar outside in the sun for a few weeks. Essentially a moldy artificial oniony cheese yeast smell. It was pungent and would linger for a long time. You could tell if he had just been in a building after you walked in.</p>\n\n<p>I still feel bad for him. He graduated but all I can think of is that his life is not going to be very long if he doesn&#39;t lose weight. He can barely walk at 22 and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he has infections on his skin. Whenever I think of him I hope he gets the support and motivation to lose weight.</p>\n</div>",
