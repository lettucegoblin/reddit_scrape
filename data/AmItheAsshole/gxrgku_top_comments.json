I would give anything to be able to have my dad give me away. I\u2019ve never read something so evil in my whole life.</p>\n\n<p>My father had stage 4 prostate cancer when we found out about it. He had no treatment options just how to make his last time on earth comfortable. I sat by his bed almost every day. Begging him not to leave me. Watching him go from being a stocky ex soldier to an absolute skeleton in a matter of months.</p>\n\n<p>Be grateful for what you have right now. It might not be perfect but at least he\u2019s not gone!!!! I can\u2019t even begin to believe the audacity you had to ask people this.</p>\n\n<p>You are the biggest arsehole I\u2019ve read about on here. He deserves a daughter that loves him no matter what.

This is your father and you say you have a close relationship with him so what I\u2019m really reading is your embarrassed about him being paralyzed, something he can\u2019t control, and it makes you uncomfortable. You\u2019re a grown woman get over yourself. At the age of 8 when I first saw my mom in the hospital on a ventilator unable to move I remember feeling fear but never shame or uncomfortable. I was 8, a child, not a woman about to be married. \n\nFYI: my mother did walk down the aisle with me and my family, her sister stood next to her and helped her navigate her wheelchair and it was so not a big deal, and widening the aisle? What a lame excuse. What are you walking down a plank on a pirate ship? And if you do need to have the chairs spaced out an extra foot or two, cool no big deal you do that because: FAMILY. I can\u2019t imagine how insulting it would have been if I\u2019d told my mom please just sit in the corner. We did a mother daughter dance as well, and she\u2019s completely paralyzed. And now that she\u2019s dying of cancer I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019ll always have those memories and photographs of us on my wedding day. I really hope you have a moment of enlightenment and realize how awful of a request this is and I hope your mom never tells you father what you said. So heartbreaking.",

How hard is it on him that he has a life changing disability due to an accident and his daughter now doesn\u2019t spend time with him. If you were so close you\u2019d want to see him while he\u2019s alive. You\u2019re obviously an adult so that means he\u2019s probably an older adult. Yet you won\u2019t see him cuz it hurts you. Do you have any empathy? Think for a second what he must feel like especially with this situation and you won\u2019t have to wonder who\u2019s the asshole. You\u2019re taking away his social support while insulting him with this shit now.\n2. The aisles will have to be widened? He won\u2019t be able to give you a \u201cproper hug\u201d? bullshit you\u2019re just embarrassed, mind you for no good reason. These are very minor inconveniences at best and you\u2019re using them to justify devastating your father. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t always convenient for him to raise you and be a dad. You can\u2019t even move some aisles to have your father \u201cwho\u2019s very close\u201d be there for you on his daughters wedding day.\n\nIf I was your fianc\u00e9 I would have absolutely left you. You sound self-centered and childish.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA. Quite possibly the biggest asshole I\u2019ve ever read on this sub. 1st. You don\u2019t see him because it\u2019s hard on you? How hard is it on him that he has a life changing disability due to an accident and his daughter now doesn\u2019t spend time with him. If you were so close you\u2019d want to see him while he\u2019s alive. You\u2019re obviously an adult so that means he\u2019s probably an older adult. Yet you won\u2019t see him cuz it hurts you. Do you have any empathy? Think for a second what he must feel like especially with this situation and you won\u2019t have to wonder who\u2019s the asshole. You\u2019re taking away his social support while insulting him with this shit now.\n2. The aisles will have to be widened? He won\u2019t be able to give you a \u201cproper hug\u201d? bullshit you\u2019re just embarrassed, mind you for no good reason. These are very minor inconveniences at best and you\u2019re using them to justify devastating your father. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t always convenient for him to raise you and be a dad. You can\u2019t even move some aisles to have your father \u201cwho\u2019s very close\u201d be there for you on his daughters wedding day.</p>\n\n<p>If I was your fianc\u00e9 I would have absolutely left you.

We adjusted for his injury at the wedding - in terms of walking down the aisle it took a long time, we needed extra space for his crutches and had to change the venue of the ceremony because the previous one wasn't a flat enough area for him to navigate.
