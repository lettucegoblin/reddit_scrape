This is one of my two jobs to put myself through college. Most days are fine but other days are a living hell.\n\nYesterday I was assigned a table that had a husband, wife and what appeared to be a teenage daughter (maybe 17). Everything was going smooth at first and the wife ordered a margarita. The husband then tried ordering a beer. The wife instantly lost her noodles and said \"Uh, no. He will not have a beer. He will have a water.\" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive. It was childish.\n\nAnyways, he keeps telling me he wants a beer. She keeps telling me no. In this industry, situations like this are a lose/lose for waitresses. If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said \"Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here.\" They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.\n\nFlash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. \n\nWife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said \"She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night.\" She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it was MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.\n\nGiven the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said &quot;Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here.&quot; They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.</p>\n\n<p>Flash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. </p>\n\n<p>Wife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said &quot;She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night.&quot; She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it was MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.</p>\n\n<p>Given the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's an empty prayer in the food industry. There's really no \"everybody wins\" scenario in this kind of context. OP did the best thing they could do--take the orders of the adults as they ordered it.\n\nIf it was a 5 year old kid instead of a grown man, then you can feel free to defer to the adult overriding their request. Otherwise, what do you think you can do in this situation that's better than what OP did, and why?",

She came up for my birthday the other day and made secret reservations to take me and my two year old daughter out for dinner. It was an expensive restaurant. She told me she would pay for my entree and a drink. Anything else, I paid for. \nI honestly wasn\u2019t shocked by this because she\u2019s pulled this type of thing before.\nWell, when ordering I decided that I was only going to get an entree and a drink. I don\u2019t care for appetizers or desert anyway. We got my daughter something small. \nMy mom INSISTED on ordering an appetizer and she wanted one sooooo bad!!! I told her I was not interested and she threw a tantrum. She ordered one anyway. She also ordered the most expensive entree on the menu that cost 35 dollars. My dinner cost 24 and was the same price as most of the other entrees on the menu. \n\nBill came out and my mom told me that she only had 100 dollars and that I was to pay for tip and whatever was left. She messed up the bill and the manager had to get involved and fix it. It was embarrassing. I ended up paying for 40 dollars of the bill which equaled out to the cost of my dinner and drink and the cost of the app as well... \nSo basically, my mom took me out to dinner for my birthday and basically made me pay for it..... she has ZERO idea that anything was wrong with this situation and I\u2019m just brushing it off... \n\nAnother one...\nMy daughters second birthday party, \nI had a backyard birthday party planned. my mom knew I needed help setting up all the decor and cooking for the party that was set for 1:00 pm. Had about 40 people invited. She specifically told me she wanted to cook the food and she planned the food. I bought all of it. \nNight before the party, My mom tells me her and her friends are going to bring my daughter for breakfast the morning of the party. I assumed she meant like 8 in the morning and would be back to help set up and do everything.... nope.... I HAD A PANIC ATTACK BECAUSE I WAS SETTING UP ALL ALONE, FOOD WAS UNCOOKED, I WAS LEGIT ALONE AND I NEEDED HELP! I had a melt down trying to put a plastic table cloth on a table and it kept blowing in the wind! I needed two people and couldn\u2019t manage it alone. She and her friends AND MY DAUGHTER didn\u2019t return until A HALF HOUR AFTER THE PARTY STARTED! All the guests were confused when they arrived why my daughter wasn\u2019t there... \nAgain, she had no idea anything was wrong or that she was wrong. Everyone arrived to the party for my daughter and my daughter wasn\u2019t even here! \nI brought it up with her and she played victim. To this day she still has no idea she was wrong and thinks I\u2019m crazy. Ughh! \nEnd Vent lol",

Hair stylists can get treated horribly for things that aren\u2019t their fault (like the client telling the stylist they haven\u2019t used box dye before a service, and this can really effect the results of professional color. Or they do a great cut/color and only get tipped a dollar or two, or even no tip at all.)\n  Pro tip- if you\u2019re loyal to your stylist and tip well sometimes they will do freebies for you. My stylist is amazing and my last cut (way before Covid) was free! When I see her again this week I plan on tipping A LOT bc she couldn\u2019t work during Covid. A good hair stylist is hard to find, an awesome stylist is a unicorn.",
