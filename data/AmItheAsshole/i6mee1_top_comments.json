Every time I make tacos, my boyfriend always makes jokes about how I\u2019m \u201cdisrespecting Mexican culture\u201d by not having cheese in my tacos. I\u2019ve told him multiple times I\u2019m not going to give myself the shits just to make him feel better about my friggin\u2019 tacos (he's not even Mexican, he's white.).\n\nThis came to a head last night when we were having tacos again. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there\u2019s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.\n\nI told my boyfriend he was a raging douchecanoe and went to bed, leaving him to do the cleanup. I still haven\u2019t spoken to him all morning, and he\u2019s complaining about how I \"forced\" him to do the dishes, because normally I do them.

Every time I make tacos, my boyfriend always makes jokes about how I\u2019m \u201cdisrespecting Mexican culture\u201d by not having cheese in my tacos. I\u2019ve told him multiple times I\u2019m not going to give myself the shits just to make him feel better about my friggin\u2019 tacos (he&#39;s not even Mexican, he&#39;s white.).</p>\n\n<p>This came to a head last night when we were having tacos again. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there\u2019s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>I told my boyfriend he was a raging douchecanoe and went to bed, leaving him to do the cleanup. I still haven\u2019t spoken to him all morning, and he\u2019s complaining about how I &quot;forced&quot; him to do the dishes, because normally I do them. AITA here?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Nta. But im so sick of these posts. &quot;My significant other is being borderline abusive and so i reacted this way (usually something super lame like i defended myself, or called him out, or made him do a chore that they should be doing anyway but never have to because the op is just soooo happy to be in a relationship they do the all the cooking, cleaning, planning, apologizing) obviously your not the asshole. Obvioulsy he is. Obviously he should be doing 50% of the dishes ALWAYS not just when he tries to poison you. Gosh are people really so desperate to be with someone they put up with that kind of behavior and legitimately think for once in their relationship demanding equality and respect makes them the asshole? Its so frustrating reading these. HE TRIED TO POISON YOU. stand up for yourself.</p>\n</div>",

Especially since I don't mind taco bell shells. If they taste similar after heating then that would make eating them more enjoyable. I still won't buy them cause I'm spoiled with flavors of homemade, but it's still good to know.",
