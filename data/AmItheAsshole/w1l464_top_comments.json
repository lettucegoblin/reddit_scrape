Conversely, 4 hours is a long time to grocery shop unless you live a substantial amount of time away from the grocery store which would have made it impossible for you to come home immediately.

He's been doing live streaming a lot lately even though I told him that we have responsibilities to take care of. Before our daughter (she's 7 months old) was born he'd stream randomly and spend lot of time with his \"followers\". Answering questions and engaging in conversations. He keeps saying that his followers are good for his mental health and that engaging with them weekly makes him become better at socializing and communicating.\n\n\nHe's been complaining about wanting to do a live stream for days. I told him we'd look at our schedule and see if we could get him some time to make it happen. Apparently, this wasn't good enough. Yesterday I had tk gj grocery shopping and asked him to keep an eye on our daughter while she was asleep. He said okay.\n\n\nI was gone for 4hrs but kept calling him to see if everything was OK. He'd tell me she was alright and that she was sleeping. I started getting this weird feeling something was wrong because she must've had been hungry or needed a diaper change. He argued that everything was fine. I immediately went home and when I entered the house I didn't find him, j shouted his name but got nothing. I went into the bedroom and saw that my daughter was awake and her diaper wasn't changed...and worse was that her bottle was even touched. I was confused I got out and noticed that his office's door was closed. I figured he was doing a live streaming from the noise I heard. I was beyond seething I barged into the office and saw him sitting. I blew up while he was trying to turn his mic off and telling me to stop but I didnt stop. I berated him for leaving our daughter unattended and with no milk nor diaper change. He freaked out on me saying I just ended his entire channel and destroyed his fan base for interrupting his live stream and embarrassing and scandalized him like that. I told him to not say a word but he kept yelling calling me out of control and unhinged. He was almost crying so I had to ,eave the office.\n\n\nHe kept fighting with me til I decided to go stay with my mom. He started blaming me for ignoring his needs after he already expressed them and that he forgot to do what I asked him and I'd cost him so much.

Unless you can actually prove he didn't check on her or just left her regardless, you way overreacted. Also, at 7mon, 4hrs between diaper changes once in awhile isn't that big of a deal. They can hold larger amounts of pee for longer periods of time compared to a newborn. Kids who sleep through the night go longer without a change and are fine.

People can be selfish to the point of neglect of others without being addicted to something.

Now, maybe in part it is good for his mental health; social interaction is always recommended, regardless of in-person or online, written or video. But in this case he was using the \u201cmental health\u201d claim as an excuse to justify his selfish wants. \n\nOP is absolutely NTA, and her husband is a vain, selfish man who cares more about his popularity than his family.
