Its sketchy as hell.\n\nI do have one question tho and I'm not sure you can answer it, but id like some clarity on it. You said you spoke with the office person, the teacher, and the principal in person and over the phone. So how the fuck did the superintendent find out about this mess and send the headphones as an apology? I mean, i have no problem with the superintendent stepping in and cleaning up the bullshit, but at the same time, it does make me question how they found out and if you did some Karen shit to make sure they knew about it. \n\nI mean, regardless, im happy that the kid got his shit he was owed but either you did some karen shit or you didnt and its pretty unclear at this point. Keeping the NTA judgment for now, will wait for clarity answers.\n\nEdit: definitely NTA, and also, your husband is a bit of a dick. Like, a dickhead, not the whole dick, but just that bit of it.

If INFO is needed, please ask.\n\nSon is in 4th grade. School is only open on Mondays. The rest of the week he is home with me. They dont do virtual learning during the rest of the week. No zoom calls are made. No teacher actually checks in. Homework at home is not to be sent back to the school and instead they get a participation grade the following week if they tell their teacher they completed it. Its backwards and your students arent being graded for the work they actually do.\n\nEvery monday we get a new flier in the mail asking for donations. Last week we got a flier that said to send out 20 emails to individuals to ask them for donations, with the promise of prizes for participation. They also had other prizes on this flier. Basically, the more people who donate using your name, the bigger the prize you get. \n\nMy son wanted the headphones prize. No where on the flier did it say how many donations was needed. I called the school to ask and they said 12. I sent out the 20 emails. 14 people donated. The donation list was to be emailed to the school with the student ID and we were to pick up the prizes this past Monday. Son was losing his mind excited because he got the 12 donations needed for the headphones. \n\nWe walk in and they proceed to tell me and my son that he did not qualify for the prize because in order to be eligible, you needed to get those 20 donations. Apparently the prizes for donations started counting AFTER you recieved the 20. They turned damn near every student away, not just my kid.\n\nSo I sent the boy out with his father and pulled the teacher and principle aside to let them know that I thought it was fucked up that they got these kids hopes up for absolutely nothing and that all they accomplished was destroying the children's spirits by lying to their faces. I then told them that I was told by the secretary that he only needed 12 donations for those headphones. \n\nThey said \"Sorry you feel that way. This is just how things are right now due to Covid.\" So I responded with \"Oh. So lying to students and breaking their spirits is okay because of Covid? Failing to provide virtual learning for the rest of the week like other schools is okay because of Covid? Asking for donations when the kids are only here once a week must be okay too right?\" I then walked out. \n\nWell, my son got the headphones in the mail today with a note from the superintendent that said \"I'm very sorry for the actions of the school system and the confusion formed around the donation drive. We are trying to work with the families, not turn them away. Please accept this as an apology.\" \n\nMy son is over the moon. My husband says that I was being a Karen and that we should have just dropped it because it teaches our son that life isnt fair and that I now look like an AH helicopter parent.\n\nAITA? I dont think I am.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That might not be the case to the parent, but that's all the child gets out of it. When you downplay a child's valid emotions on matters like this, it just tells them they can't go to you when something big actually happens. It's sad and bad parenting. OP, you deserve an award for actually giving a hoot and your husband needs a kick in the nethers to knock some sense into him. Your son was promised something if he got people to donate and was duped. It's not Karen behavior to call out actual bad behavior from others especially when that person's actions affect your child. Also, given that the money wasn't even his or yours, the school pretty much scammed everyone that donated in his (and the other students') names as I'm fairly certain all or at least most of them were doing it to help the kids get their prizes. No one actually donates to schools for the hell of it; they do it for the benefit of the kids in their lives that attend said school.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. Using excuses like this, especially to your own child, just teaches them that you don&#39;t really care about them. That might not be the case to the parent, but that&#39;s all the child gets out of it. When you downplay a child&#39;s valid emotions on matters like this, it just tells them they can&#39;t go to you when something big actually happens. It&#39;s sad and bad parenting. OP, you deserve an award for actually giving a hoot and your husband needs a kick in the nethers to knock some sense into him. Your son was promised something if he got people to donate and was duped. It&#39;s not Karen behavior to call out actual bad behavior from others especially when that person&#39;s actions affect your child. Also, given that the money wasn&#39;t even his or yours, the school pretty much scammed everyone that donated in his (and the other students&#39;) names as I&#39;m fairly certain all or at least most of them were doing it to help the kids get their prizes. No one actually donates to schools for the hell of it; they do it for the benefit of the kids in their lives that attend said school.</p>\n</div>",

If my kid in my little \u201c third world\u201d country can have organized school days via teams and uses a educational platform, I can\u2019t see why in your country which I will assume it\u2019s the states won\u2019t do it. In my country education it\u2019s a right for the children, and this is vulnerable those rights. Also if they are asking for donations like you say for just go one day per week and then play dumb and say people misunderstood the amount of donations it\u2019s bs. That\u2019s lying about it like you stated. If the school my son it\u2019s at ( private) was pulling that kind of bs, trust me the parents would break havoc and reporters to the minestry of education and the secretary of education in the city. Please do right for your kid and report that school for what they are doing.",

Why they just have students go once a week and tren don\u2019t do the rest of the week classes via zoom or teams? That\u2019s wrong, the kids need to learn, have their lessons.

Hence why the most common example of a Karen is the \"I want to speak manager\" line since service staff are often BIPOC. Karen wasn't just ANY middle-age white woman, they were a very specific kind of WW. If you had a legit grievance like OP and handle it in a mature matter then you're not a Karen. HOWEVER like with most slang terms from the Black community it was appropriated by white people and used incorrectly. Because this was a phrase specifically used for WW, WM turned into a phrase to browbeat any WW who spoke up. Among the BIPOC community, we know the difference between someone who is annoying, someone who has a legit grievance, and someone who is intentionally trying to weaponize their white feminity aka a Karen. But the ironic part about asking people to not use the term \"Karen\" because it hurts your fee fees is a very Karen thing to do. It's a phrase that literally would't exists if some WW didn't run around being...Karens. The fact that there is not one singular corresponding name for WM speaks more to the power of WM than it does to the oppressed people who came up with the term Karen to describe a shorthand for the type of person who causes them harm. Long story: As long as there are Karens, BIPOCs will continue to use the phrase to accurately describe them as such and WM will continue to misuse the phrase to be misogynistic.",

Not just with fundraisers, but with other types of activities as well. My parents (especially my dad) were assholes and were not well liked by a lot of people. By the time I reached high school I started to realize that there were a lot of things I was missing out on because I didn't have any of those built-in social connections. It is easy to forget to include a kid when you either don't know or don't like her parents, I guess. \n\nNot to mention that I struggled making friends of my own, because I never got to observe what it looks like to see friendly adults interacting with each other.",
