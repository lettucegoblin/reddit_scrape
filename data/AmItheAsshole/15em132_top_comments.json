Can you honestly tell me that your wife doesn\u2019t exhibit any of these behaviors or that you couldn\u2019t see any of her current behaviors turning into any of these?\n\n- Suspiciousness, paranoid ideas, or uneasiness with others\n- Trouble thinking clearly and logically\n- Withdrawing socially and spending a lot more time alone\n- Unusual or overly intense ideas, strange feelings, or a lack of feelings\n- Decline in self-care or personal hygiene\n- Disruption of sleep, including difficulty falling asleep and reduced sleep time\n- Difficulty telling reality from fantasy\n- Confused speech or trouble communicating\n- Sudden drop in grades or job performance\n\nYour wife is in real danger aside from getting your daughter kicked out of daycare or losing her job. Your daughter is in danger developmentally, socially, intellectually, autonomously, but also because what happens if psychosis does manifest and she\u2019s with your wife. \n\nHer therapist can\u2019t talk to you but ***you can talk to her therapist*** and detail what\u2019s happening. My guess is your wife is not being honest with her therapist because she knows she\u2019s spiraling and the therapist will have to take action. You\u2019ve said there\u2019s been no progress in a year and that some things have gotten worse. Either her therapist sucks or your wife is lying to them. You can email or call her therapist and have a one-sided conversation about what and how\u2019s she\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve done this with my mother, and while they couldn\u2019t tell me anything the insights that I provided were valuable as she was outright lying to her therapist. My husband has done this for me when I\u2019m in crisis. \n\nHonestly? You\u2019re a doormat and are excusing her behavior. Hundreds of people have given you great advice as to what you probably should do. At this point your marriage should be contingent on medication, family therapy, and her allowing her therapist to be open with you about how her treatment is going and telling you, to a limited degree, what she\u2019s telling the them. \n\nAnd you say you can\u2019t be the primary contact for daycare because you can\u2019t talk to them? Why? The only reason your daycare should be communicating during the day is if there\u2019s an emergency. There is no reason for them to \u201ccheck in\u201d during the day or have to answer 1000 questions that are either pointless, intrusive, or could be communicated at pickup or drop off. \n\nI have volunteered in the mental health field working with people of all ages from small children to geriatrics for years. I\u2019ve seen women just like your wife, and I\u2019ve seen kids that grew up with parents like your wife, and even you. Your wife is doing your daughter no favors and will almost guarantee that she will be alienated from peers, behind developmentally and socially, will not be able to function as an adult, and possibly she will estrange herself from you and your wife as soon as she possibly can. And your wife is putting herself through the mental ringer and there will almost certainly come a point where she is unable to handle it. You are enabling all of it. \n\nYour wife is in danger. Your daughter is in danger. Your life with your family is in danger. You **have** to do better. You can\u2019t sweep this under the rug. You have to put your foot down. \n\nFrom a personal note I also live with mental illness, have been diagnosed and living with it for over 20 years. When my husband and I got serious he gave me an ultimatum - take care of your mental health and I will always support and stand by you. Even if I\u2019m in an episode and everything has gone sideways, which does happen from time to time despite medication and therapy and constant work at it, but as long as I\u2019m reaching out for help and actively trying, he\u2019s there. I\u2019m well aware that if I stop meds, therapy, etc. he will leave. And guess what - we\u2019ve both held up our end of the bargain. Even when shit is absolutely down the drain, as long as I\u2019m trying he\u2019ll be there in whatever capacity I need him to be. \n\nYour wife is not even trying. She hasn\u2019t given up, she just doesn\u2019t even care. She doesn\u2019t care about the strain she\u2019s putting on you or your marriage. She doesn\u2019t care about the damage she\u2019s doing to your daughter. And she doesn\u2019t care because you have sat back and just let all of it happen. \n\nHonestly? You\u2019re an idiot. You come here asking for advice but keep trying to explain everything away or say I can\u2019t or I won\u2019t. But at what point will you? When will too much be too much?

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy wife and I have a 3 year old daughter, Alexis. Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can\u2019t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. She\u2019s in therapy and is working on it.\n\nFirst program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn\u2019t understand why the other child wasn\u2019t punished for it. This daycare didn\u2019t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming \u201cone of those moms\u201d. \n\nWe chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn\u2019t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won\u2019t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn\u2019t get that opportunity.

Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can\u2019t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. She\u2019s in therapy and is working on it.</p>\n\n<p>First program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn\u2019t understand why the other child wasn\u2019t punished for it. This daycare didn\u2019t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming \u201cone of those moms\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>We chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn\u2019t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won\u2019t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn\u2019t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part. </p>\n\n<p>Then, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled.

Perhaps  she simply cannot be the primary contact. You may need to ask for regular updates sent to you via email or text, that you can access at the end of your work day, and give an emergency number in case of a true emergency. Therefore all payments, schedules, parenting decisions etc. go through you. I'm sure this is doable and if you were a single parent this is what you'd have to do. Maybe you plan to do this for 2 weeks and then reassess. Do I think it'll be hard? Yes. Do I think something like this is necessary? Absolutely.",

I tried really hard in college to get my mom to teach me how to take care of my own stuff, like taxes, or not have a tracker on me, but it never worked and honestly broke me down further. I understand she\u2019s not 100% responsible and I\u2019m still an adult and it\u2019s up to me to get it together. But I will say her helicopter parenting really set me up for failure in a way that has made my 20\u2019s very painful and lost an amazing relationship and really becoming my own person because of it. I\u2019m working hard on it now. But it\u2019s been a really hard and long roadblock. \n\nThe other thing that made it so difficult was because she loves me so damn much, made it hard to cut her off or tell her no. My dad was diagnosed with a bunch of mental illnesses right before I was born, and dealing with my father, and my older brothers issues along with working full time from home and homeschooling us, she was loosing it mentally and invested in her children to keep her strong. When my brother turned 18 moved out without telling anyone and cut off my parents for a year or so. This really made my mom double down on investing in me. I understand and sympathize where she\u2019s coming from, and my heart breaks for how freakin much she cares for me, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m responsible for her happiness and although I want nothing more than to make her happy, I can\u2019t live my own life, I ultimately can\u2019t be responsible for her happiness. It\u2019s been a really painful process. \n\nOP is NTA - but idk if having your wife stay at home with your daughter is the best solution. Although I get there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other good solution, I\u2019d really push for more therapy on top of what she\u2019s already doing and holding strong to not micromanaging your daughters life.

My dad was diagnosed with a bunch of mental illnesses right before I was born, and dealing with my father, and my older brothers issues along with working full time from home and homeschooling us, she was loosing it mentally and invested in her children to keep her strong. When my brother turned 18 moved out without telling anyone and cut off my parents for a year or so. This really made my mom double down on investing in me. I understand and sympathize where she\u2019s coming from, and my heart breaks for how freakin much she cares for me, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m responsible for her happiness and although I want nothing more than to make her happy, I can\u2019t live my own life, I ultimately can\u2019t be responsible for her happiness. It\u2019s been a really painful process. </p>\n\n<p>OP is NTA - but idk if having your wife stay at home with your daughter is the best solution. Although I get there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other good solution, I\u2019d really push for more therapy on top of what she\u2019s already doing and holding strong to not micromanaging your daughters life. Whatever that looks like.</p>\n</div>",

You're both going to need to do a lot of work to make a better home for your child. You need to be a lot more assertive - your child is already being hurt by her behavior. 1. Anxiety is not an excuse for hurting your child, and her actions are going to ultimately cause your child to suffer. As a potential start:\n\n1. Clear a time to sit down with her and discuss the situation\n2. Explain that you have tried to support her and allow her to navigate her anxiety on her terms (*if that's true, of course)*. You understand how difficult it has been and want to keep supporting her. However, the current method *is not working*. You have lost placement in two day cares and are close to losing the third because she is either unable or unwilling to control her behavior. This is hurting your child and you.\n3. Changing her current behavior will mean leaving her comfort zone and doing things that may feel challenging or threatening. You want to be there to support her but that means you need to be involved.\n4. Come up with a plan of action for the next week. Couples therapy must be on that list. Follow through.\n5. Remember that change is terrifying, and the way she's living right now may be painful but it's a comfortable painful - it hurts, but it's a known hurt. Change brings unknown hurts, and that's a threat. You will become a threat by demanding change, and she will go on the defensive to avoid suffering. It's a natural response. Try to avoid feeding into it and stick to \"we need to come up with our next step\" instead of rushing to comfort or becoming angry yourself. And if she absolutely refuses (or even if she doesn't), get some therapy for yourself so you can figure out your own next steps.",

One of our friends was turning out to be exactly like this mom. Her kid was hitting a lot. Trying to hurt pets etc. To the point the other kids were begging for him not to come to birthday parties etc. We were still young moms back in the 80'and had not learned assertiveness. So we had a hard time confronting her about her son's behavior. At one point my sister got so disgusted she told her child to hit him back if he hit her again. My sister's little girl was 4 and problem child was about 6 months older. Well problem child hit my niece, niece hit back, our friend loses it with her poor boy crying and all, my sis says, well I guess my daughter had enough of being hit, so she hit back. Our soon to be ex friend responds, she shouldn't have hit him, he's too young to understand being hit back. She needs to be punished. Honest to God! Nowadays through the grapevine I hear he's still a bully. In his late 30's.",
