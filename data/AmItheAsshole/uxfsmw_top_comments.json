This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nAITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?\n\nI'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. \nI tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.\n I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating \" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now\" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk.

Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we&#39;ll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he&#39;s autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. \nI tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can&#39;t tell I&#39;m not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I&#39;m still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I&#39;m also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.\n I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I&#39;m trying to watch a show, and that I&#39;m not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I&#39;m getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating &quot; i&#39;m so sorry, i&#39;m horrible god im just gonna shut up now&quot; rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it&#39;s okay, and I just want some time to myself as I&#39;m not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk.

Most of us don't want to be cured, because autism isn't a disease we have, it's like the foundation of who we are and how we think. Even if it causes us a lot of problems, to be 'cured' of autism would essentially be to take my brain and replace it with someone elses.\n\nFunctioning labels are also often harmful - they are used to deny accommodations and assistance to those are labelled 'high functioning' and to infantise and dismiss those who are labelled 'low functioning'.  You can read more about that [here](https://planningacrossthespectrum.com/blog/why-stop-using-functioning-labels/).\n\nI know your comment comes from a place of empathy, just wanting to point out why some of the language you've used is outdated.",

I was calling him out on something on the playground when a teacher told me that he had Asperger's (as that was his diagnosis back then) and \"couldn't help himself\". This was shortly after he'd been diagnosed. I told the teacher he knew the difference between right and wrong, he had difficulty reading social cues and emotions, but if you were direct with him he'd understand and that his diagnosis wasn't an excuse to not learn how to be around others.\n\nMy brother had been using it as an excuse and dobbed me in to our mum, who then armed herself with a whole ton of resources and had another chat with his teacher and the principal about what Asperger's meant, especially in regards to my brother, and what the school could do (and what they shouldn't). She then went on to found a local organisation with a few other parents of neurodivergent children. Their focus was on getting resources into the local library system (we're from a country town and our library is linked to other country libraries and a mobile one for more regional areas), information nights by specialists for teachers and parents, and providing assistance and information through the diagnostic process (back then the only organisation that did an official diagnosis was in the city, and waiting lists were long).\n\nMy mum fought so much for my brother to be diagnosed and get the resources and assistance he needed, but she also fought to make sure people still treated him as a person and he didn't end up a little shit. Thanks to that he isn't, he's doing well in life and if you're explicit when he's missing cues he stops even if he doesn't understand why and he knows that he doesn't need to know why.",

How well someone can pass for non-autistic varies a lot by situation.\n\nI\u2019m usually considered high functioning. I have a healthy social life, can work a normal job, and most allistic people don\u2019t think of me as autistic. However, I have huge sensory issues. The way sound bounces and distorts in something like a mall or an apple store can reduce me to tears. I use earbud or specialized ear plugs to go grocery shopping. If you want me to try a new food, I need to do so slowly, because it can be overwhelming otherwise, even if I enjoy it. Certainly clothing textures feel terrible and are actually painful. And if I\u2019m in pain, or overwhelmed, or haven\u2019t eaten and my blood sugar crashes, I go nonverbal. I can understand spoken words just fine. I communicate in ASL or via text, but I can\u2019t put my thoughts into actual spoken English. \n\nIf someone saw me in a hospital, they tend to consider me very low functioning, which means they tend to assume that I can\u2019t maintain any social relationships, that my spouse is my caretaker, and they talk to me like a young child or a pet who can\u2019t understand them.",
