        "body": "I mean, the way life is is that you get to make decisions about your life, and your sister gets to make decisions about hers. You can't *make* her get out any more than you can make her husband step up and be a better husband and father.\n\nIf you actually need to hear this, by all means, give your sister's opinion about your outburst a lot more weight than her husband's, the guy you neither like nor respect, I mean, obviously right?   \n\n\nJust...I'd recommend keeping an eye on what you have control over, what you don't, and what your positive outcomes are. Getting your BIL to do a 180 because he realized you're right? You can hope for it, but I recommend have a back-up goal in case that doesn't work. Getting your sister to leave him? Getting your sister a reasonable amount of help whether she leaves or stays? Not making it easier for your sister to stay in a relationship that you think is bad for her? Letting your sister know you 100% have her back whatever choices she makes in life and that you believe she's capable of making the best choices for herself (even if you would make different choices in her shoes)? Getting to go to sleep at night knowing that you are in the *right* and your BIL is *wrong*? What do you *want* here?\n\nIt's *possible* your sister will have an easier time raising 5 kids alone than with her husband. It's also possible she won't. (Divorce is expensive; hiring cleaners is cheaper.) It's also very much the case that he, and your sister, let you and your fiance stay at their place for 6 weeks when you needed a place to stay, and you kinda don't seem to be...acknowledging that was a kind thing and generous for them to do, in what I imagine was already a pretty crowded household? So yes, I do wonder whether you might be missing some other good things your BIL does. And I do worry that you're missing that your sister's decisions are *hers* to make, not yours, even if you have really, really strong opinions about what's best for her.\n\nIt's also...within the realm of possibility that your sister doing all the work isn't just because her husband isn't stepping up. People tend to select partners who want complimentary things, sometimes people have a strong internal psychological need to be *needed,* and it takes more than a divorce to change that. I do think people make the best available decisions for themselves when they get unconditional support, *not* when they have someone in their life attempting to make their life choices for them, *especially* people who kinda struggle with assertiveness and not being a doormat.\n\nIt is good that you care so much about gender roles and relationships, and it's good that you want the best for your sister. I just...think some of that passion might be a little misplaced. I used to be really, really into bicycle advocacy and *no* amount of enthusiasm for bicycling was going to get my mom into bicycling as a method of transportation. But that passion went very well into outreach and town hall meetings and so on. I think you need either a different *cause* (re your sister) or a different *outlet*. You gotta push where you can actually make a positive difference, you know? Sometimes you find yourself pushing against a wall, and pushing harder just means you're pushing harder, it's not going to move the wall.",

You can&#39;t <em>make</em> her get out any more than you can make her husband step up and be a better husband and father.</p>\n\n<p>If you actually need to hear this, by all means, give your sister&#39;s opinion about your outburst a lot more weight than her husband&#39;s, the guy you neither like nor respect, I mean, obviously right?   </p>\n\n<p>Just...I&#39;d recommend keeping an eye on what you have control over, what you don&#39;t, and what your positive outcomes are. Getting your BIL to do a 180 because he realized you&#39;re right? You can hope for it, but I recommend have a back-up goal in case that doesn&#39;t work. Getting your sister to leave him? Getting your sister a reasonable amount of help whether she leaves or stays? Not making it easier for your sister to stay in a relationship that you think is bad for her? Letting your sister know you 100% have her back whatever choices she makes in life and that you believe she&#39;s capable of making the best choices for herself (even if you would make different choices in her shoes)? Getting to go to sleep at night knowing that you are in the <em>right</em> and your BIL is <em>wrong</em>? What do you <em>want</em> here?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s <em>possible</em> your sister will have an easier time raising 5 kids alone than with her husband. It&#39;s also possible she won&#39;t. (Divorce is expensive; hiring cleaners is cheaper.) It&#39;s also very much the case that he, and your sister, let you and your fiance stay at their place for 6 weeks when you needed a place to stay, and you kinda don&#39;t seem to be...acknowledging that was a kind thing and generous for them to do, in what I imagine was already a pretty crowded household? So yes, I do wonder whether you might be missing some other good things your BIL does. And I do worry that you&#39;re missing that your sister&#39;s decisions are <em>hers</em> to make, not yours, even if you have really, really strong opinions about what&#39;s best for her.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also...within the realm of possibility that your sister doing all the work isn&#39;t just because her husband isn&#39;t stepping up. People tend to select partners who want complimentary things, sometimes people have a strong internal psychological need to be <em>needed,</em> and it takes more than a divorce to change that. I do think people make the best available decisions for themselves when they get unconditional support, <em>not</em> when they have someone in their life attempting to make their life choices for them, <em>especially</em> people who kinda struggle with assertiveness and not being a doormat.</p>\n\n<p>It is good that you care so much about gender roles and relationships, and it&#39;s good that you want the best for your sister. I just...think some of that passion might be a little misplaced. I used to be really, really into bicycle advocacy and <em>no</em> amount of enthusiasm for bicycling was going to get my mom into bicycling as a method of transportation. But that passion went very well into outreach and town hall meetings and so on. I think you need either a different <em>cause</em> (re your sister) or a different <em>outlet</em>. You gotta push where you can actually make a positive difference, you know? Sometimes you find yourself pushing against a wall, and pushing harder just means you&#39;re pushing harder, it&#39;s not going to move the wall.</p>\n</div>",

She was running late and didn't think she'd get there soon enough to warm it properly in time. All he had to do was remove the plastic cover and pop it in the oven at 300.

This is not how it works and also he wouldn't have been wasting any of his time by doing it correctly. He did ruin the lasagna though.

        "body": "I disagree.  Women carry babies for 9 months inside them.  When the baby is born they have hormones which help them to take care of the baby (except in the case of post natal depression).  In the last month of pregnancy women\u2019s sleep cycles change.  The idea is that it is to prepare the mother for disrupted sleep once the baby arrives.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve watched the Netflix documentary on babies you will see that mother\u2019s brains scan differently to that of the father after the baby is born.  The mother is biologically programmed to care for the baby in a way that the father is not.  Researchers compared the scans to the brain scans of same sex men who have a new baby in the home (either through surrogacy or adoption) and they found that the primary carer\u2019s brain lights up the same way a mother\u2019s brain lights up - showing that men are indeed adaptable. \n\nHowever, only the primary carer\u2019s brain lit up in the scan.  I find that very interesting.  \n\nThere is usually one parent who does the bulk of the childcare, especially after birth and it\u2019s usually the mother.  \n\nIn respect to OP - her sister is waking up to **cook** breakfast at 4am.  Why?  Why is she doing this?  She has to be at work so why is she cooking?\n\nShe can give the kids a piece of toast or some microwave oatmeal.  She doesn\u2019t need to cook for them at 4am.  She sure as hell doesn\u2019t need to cook for her husband at breakfast time or even make him dinner.\n\nIf he\u2019s not helping out why the hell was she having sex with him knowing what a shitty father he is?\n\nShe\u2019s played the victim.  I don\u2019t know why.\n\nEDIT:  I meant to add there comes a point & it\u2019s usually when the mother returns to work that the father has to do more to help.  I can\u2019t imagine anyone putting up with working and still doing everything around the house.  I don\u2019t do everything around the house and I don\u2019t even work.  But that needs to be a conversation that the OP\u2019s sister has with her husband and she should never have had any more children if he wasn\u2019t stepping up.  Weaponised incompetence is when a person does something so badly that they aren\u2019t asked to do it again.  This guy does **nothing** around the house - yet the OP\u2019s sister continues to breed with him and she also goes to work.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I disagree.  Women carry babies for 9 months inside them.  When the baby is born they have hormones which help them to take care of the baby (except in the case of post natal depression).  In the last month of pregnancy women\u2019s sleep cycles change.  The idea is that it is to prepare the mother for disrupted sleep once the baby arrives.  </p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve watched the Netflix documentary on babies you will see that mother\u2019s brains scan differently to that of the father after the baby is born.  The mother is biologically programmed to care for the baby in a way that the father is not.  Researchers compared the scans to the brain scans of same sex men who have a new baby in the home (either through surrogacy or adoption) and they found that the primary carer\u2019s brain lights up the same way a mother\u2019s brain lights up - showing that men are indeed adaptable. </p>\n\n<p>However, only the primary carer\u2019s brain lit up in the scan.  I find that very interesting.  </p>\n\n<p>There is usually one parent who does the bulk of the childcare, especially after birth and it\u2019s usually the mother.  </p>\n\n<p>In respect to OP - her sister is waking up to <strong>cook</strong> breakfast at 4am.  Why?  Why is she doing this?  She has to be at work so why is she cooking?</p>\n\n<p>She can give the kids a piece of toast or some microwave oatmeal.  She doesn\u2019t need to cook for them at 4am.  She sure as hell doesn\u2019t need to cook for her husband at breakfast time or even make him dinner.</p>\n\n<p>If he\u2019s not helping out why the hell was she having sex with him knowing what a shitty father he is?</p>\n\n<p>She\u2019s played the victim.  I don\u2019t know why.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  I meant to add there comes a point &amp; it\u2019s usually when the mother returns to work that the father has to do more to help.  I can\u2019t imagine anyone putting up with working and still doing everything around the house.  I don\u2019t do everything around the house and I don\u2019t even work.  But that needs to be a conversation that the OP\u2019s sister has with her husband and she should never have had any more children if he wasn\u2019t stepping up.  Weaponised incompetence is when a person does something so badly that they aren\u2019t asked to do it again.  This guy does <strong>nothing</strong> around the house - yet the OP\u2019s sister continues to breed with him and she also goes to work.</p>\n</div>",
