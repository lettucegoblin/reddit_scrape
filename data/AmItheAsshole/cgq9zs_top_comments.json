This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nOkay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe your nephew (more or less) deliberately provoked his mother by repeating what you said about her. Maybe he even put his own spin on it so it came out sounding worse than you meant it.\n\nIf you get a chance, read the book *Games People Play* by Eric Berne. It\u2019s basically a description of how dysfunctional families operate. Games are things that people do that allow them to express their emotions indirectly. Instead of addressing the real problem, they create other problems and use those as an excuse to express emotion, while deflecting blame away from themselves. One of the games Berne describes is called \u201cLet\u2019s You and Him Fight.\u201d The scenario is: A feels resentment toward B, but A doesn\u2019t feel strong enough to take a stand against B, so instead, A provokes a fight between B and C. A common way to do this is to tell B: \u201cDo you want to hear what C said about you?\u201d\n\nIt looks like this game has been played out twice in your family. First, your sister provoked a fight between you and your father, probably because she had resentments of her own against your father. Then your nephew provoked a fight between you and your sister. The habit of playing certain games does get passed on through families. Another game that might be relevant is called \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d\n\nBy the way, Berne\u2019s system of psychotherapy is called Transactional Analysis. It was a trendy topic when the book came out, but mostly it has now been forgotten. You don\u2019t have to buy into his whole system in order to understand the games. If you read his book, I recommend you skip or skim over the introductory material and go right to the descriptions of the games. You don\u2019t even have to read them in any particular order.",

Here\u2019s a possibility I want to throw out for your consideration:</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there was already some ongoing conflict between your nephew and your sister before you came along. Maybe your nephew (more or less) deliberately provoked his mother by repeating what you said about her. Maybe he even put his own spin on it so it came out sounding worse than you meant it.</p>\n\n<p>If you get a chance, read the book <em>Games People Play</em> by Eric Berne. It\u2019s basically a description of how dysfunctional families operate. Games are things that people do that allow them to express their emotions indirectly. Instead of addressing the real problem, they create other problems and use those as an excuse to express emotion, while deflecting blame away from themselves. One of the games Berne describes is called \u201cLet\u2019s You and Him Fight.\u201d The scenario is: A feels resentment toward B, but A doesn\u2019t feel strong enough to take a stand against B, so instead, A provokes a fight between B and C. A common way to do this is to tell B: \u201cDo you want to hear what C said about you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It looks like this game has been played out twice in your family. First, your sister provoked a fight between you and your father, probably because she had resentments of her own against your father. Then your nephew provoked a fight between you and your sister. The habit of playing certain games does get passed on through families. Another game that might be relevant is called \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Berne\u2019s system of psychotherapy is called Transactional Analysis. It was a trendy topic when the book came out, but mostly it has now been forgotten. You don\u2019t have to buy into his whole system in order to understand the games. If you read his book, I recommend you skip or skim over the introductory material and go right to the descriptions of the games. You don\u2019t even have to read them in any particular order.</p>\n</div>",

Well after my grandfather passed, my mom tells me we\u2019re invited to a party at those cousins place, which is like 15 min from my house.... I go, and ask, why has no one ever been at any parties, totally ignorant of the situation. It turned out my moms cousin married someone of not only a different religion, but also a different race. My grandfather apparently severed all familial ties over it. You could imagine my sisters and my shock at finding out why \u201cwe\u201d hadn\u2019t been present at all the family gatherings, is because it turned out \u201cwe\u201d were racist assholes. Had we known we\u2019d have stood up and fought, but no one ever said anything to us, we had no idea, and the generation above us didn\u2019t want to challenge their parents. \n\nAnyway, my family is much larger now, sucks having been the bad guys, but we honestly had no idea.",
