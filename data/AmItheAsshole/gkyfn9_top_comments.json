To my knowledge, when you sue someone, you're suing to make whole again (i.e., if someone does $100 worth of damage to your property, you can sue for $100 to bring yourself to break even). So you're highly unlikely to get emotional damages here, but it is perfectly reasonable to demand she pay back what she has financially taken from you (the veterinary bills you've paid/will pay directly related to this damage, the cost of purchasing two new rabbits of the same age/breed, the cost of replacing your lawn to bring it back to the state it was prior to her trespassing).\n\nOne thing to note is, this could potentially go beyond small claims court (depending on your state there's different windows for how much you can sue for; many states it's 10k), at which point you would a) need to accept the maximum amount from small claims or b) go to court with a lawyer.\n\nAgain NAL, and I'd certainly advise you consult one if you're serious about pursuing this. Some employers offer discounted legal advice, or you may be able to find a lawyer who is willing to do a pro bono/discounted consult. Many lawyers will also take on a case for no fee/low fees up front and then request payment upon a successful lawsuit. Good luck with all of this, and I'm wishing you well as you mourn your lost pets.",

Other chemicals present in weed killers may include pyrethrins, carbamates, and paradichlorobenzenes   \nHere's some information   \n **Glyphosate toxicity**  \nGlyphosate has a [United States Environmental Protection Agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) (EPA) [Toxicity Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity_Class) of III (on a I to IV scale, where IV is least dangerous) for oral and inhalation exposure.[\\[46\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-epa_reds-46) Nonetheless, as with other herbicides, the EPA requires that products containing glyphosate carry a label that warns against oral intake, mandates the use of protective clothing, and instructs users not to re-enter treated fields for at least 4 hours.[\\[46\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-epa_reds-46)[\\[47\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-47) Glyphosate does not bioaccumulate and breaks down rapidly in the environment.[\\[48\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-48)  \n\n\n Other mammals A review of the ecotoxicological data on Roundup shows there are at least 58 studies of the effects of Roundup itself on a range of organisms.[\\[49\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-Giesy2000-49) This review concluded that \"for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed non-target organisms\".  \nIn a 2001, three groups of pregnant rats were fed, respectively, a regular diet with clean water, a regular diet with 0.2 ml glyphosate/ml drinking water; and a regular diet with 0.4 ml glyphosate/ml drinking water. Glyphosate induces a variety of functional abnormalities Glyphosate has no significant potential to accumulate in animal tissue.[\\[21\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-NPIC_Data_Sheet-21)  \nMammal research indicates oral intake of 1% glyphosate induces changes in liver enzyme activities   \n\n\n  \n [https://www.dovemed.com/healthy-living/first-aid/first-aid-weed-killer-poisoning/](https://www.dovemed.com/healthy-living/first-aid/first-aid-weed-killer-poisoning/)",

Other chemicals present in weed killers may include pyrethrins, carbamates, and paradichlorobenzenes<br/>\nHere&#39;s some information<br/>\n <strong>Glyphosate toxicity</strong><br/>\nGlyphosate has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency\">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity_Class\">Toxicity Class</a> of III (on a I to IV scale, where IV is least dangerous) for oral and inhalation exposure.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-epa_reds-46\">[46]</a> Nonetheless, as with other herbicides, the EPA requires that products containing glyphosate carry a label that warns against oral intake, mandates the use of protective clothing, and instructs users not to re-enter treated fields for at least 4 hours.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-epa_reds-46\">[46]</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-47\">[47]</a> Glyphosate does not bioaccumulate and breaks down rapidly in the environment.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-48\">[48]</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Other mammals A review of the ecotoxicological data on Roundup shows there are at least 58 studies of the effects of Roundup itself on a range of organisms.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-Giesy2000-49\">[49]</a> This review concluded that &quot;for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed non-target organisms&quot;.<br/>\nIn a 2001, three groups of pregnant rats were fed, respectively, a regular diet with clean water, a regular diet with 0.2 ml glyphosate/ml drinking water; and a regular diet with 0.4 ml glyphosate/ml drinking water. Glyphosate induces a variety of functional abnormalities Glyphosate has no significant potential to accumulate in animal tissue.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#cite_note-NPIC_Data_Sheet-21\">[21]</a><br/>\nMammal research indicates oral intake of 1% glyphosate induces changes in liver enzyme activities   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dovemed.com/healthy-living/first-aid/first-aid-weed-killer-poisoning/\">https://www.dovemed.com/healthy-living/first-aid/first-aid-weed-killer-poisoning/</a></p>\n</div>",

Most likely the herbicide was glyphosate based and getting rid of that will probably require physical removal of the grass and maybe up to 3-4 inches of underlying soil, depending on soil type and how much water the grass has had since spraying. Good news is that herbicides are not known for their quick mobility in soil so it would be inches of soil removal, not feet.

After a couple of weeks, she realised it was indeed real and she had to get rid of it. But it took her months to actually catch it because she kept coming up with Rube Goldberg style schemes instead of...just using a trap. One of these elaborate schemes was creating a mouse \"hotel\" out of cardboard and boxes, equipped with various facilities, a bed and food.
