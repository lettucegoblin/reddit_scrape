His actions were grossly inappropriate and you could likely be protecting the next woman he decides wants his bod. Heck, you could be protecting yourself from a dangerous predator. He had a chance to cut it out before he sent the initial texts. \n\nAny consequences are the direct result of HIS actions.\n\nEdit: I just saw your edit about going to HR. Good on you, OP!",

(I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)\n\nHe also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. \n\nWhen I saw them, I was out with friends and was like \"What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem\". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... \n\nAnd I included dealing with this fucker as a \"workday problem\" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. \n\nOn Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:\n\n \"Hi 'Coworker'\n\nI'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)\n\nPlease only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. \n\n- OP\"\n\nI didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. \n\nAnd he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? \n\nI screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying \"As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack.\" \n\nHe stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked \"Is this a work question?\" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting?\n\nHe walked off... \n\nI feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. \n\nAITA for sending that email?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dang it was close. </p>\n\n<p>When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like &quot;What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem&quot;. I have a really strict rule with myself that I don&#39;t do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don&#39;t use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it&#39;s not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I&#39;m not answering... </p>\n\n<p>And I included dealing with this fucker as a &quot;workday problem&quot; so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn&#39;t said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. </p>\n\n<p>On Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hi &#39;Coworker&#39;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)</p>\n\n<p>Please only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OP&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I&#39;d have a copy just in case. </p>\n\n<p>And he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? </p>\n\n<p>I screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying &quot;As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>He stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked &quot;Is this a work question?&quot; And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn&#39;t available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting?</p>\n\n<p>He walked off... </p>\n\n<p>I feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I&#39;m also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. </p>\n\n<p>AITA for sending that email?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I work in home care and help people who are elderly and/or disabled with their \u201cactivities of daily living\u201d such as cooking, cleaning, shopping etc..  Early on I had a client who was a vet who used a wheelchair.  One of the way he got his kicks was to ask inappropriate questions or make inappropriate comments towards me.  I tried talking to him multiple times and he might briefly change his behavior but it would always resume in a few days to maybe a week or so if I was lucky.  One day, out of totally left field, while we were waiting in line after shopping he said, \u201cI should spank you.\u201d  This was of course, completely inappropriate.  I warned him that I was going to take his groceries back to his apartment then leave.  Of course he quickly tried to change his tune and asked me to stay but I had had enough.  I took his groceries back and then I left and called work and told them what had happened.  They reassured me I was not at fault and ended up dropping him as a client.  Six months or a year later I heard that no agency would take him and though I felt a tiny twinge of guilt I thought it was what he deserved.  Client, fellow employee or superior you always have to put your foot down or they will continue to take advantage of you or humiliate you.  I also think that if you hadn\u2019t reported him he would have taken it further, seeing you as a target who wouldn\u2019t put up a fight.  Most likely he will be blackballed in your industry because no employer will want to risk the liability that comes with him.  Good luck in everything that follows.  I hope your career takes flight while he tries to get a job as a gas attendant somewhere.",
