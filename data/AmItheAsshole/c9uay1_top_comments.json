That\u2019s what it is, right? True Love? The thing you fight for every day? The thing you endure second-class treatment to protect?

I don\u2019t know your life or relationship but damn do I know this story well.\n\nMy family friends are a Hindu woman who married a Khoja man in a \u201clove marriage.\u201d Her family ostracized her and his family treated her as a second class citizen.

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nMy younger sister and I were very close when young but no so much now. I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.\n\nRecently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.\n\nMy sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.\n\nIt all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.\n\nI asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nShe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'.\n\nI was just looking out for her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is so unbelievably condescending and not even true. And she had already gotten angry and told you she loved him, so why did you feel it was AT ALL your place to keep harping on it? And then, when she told you AGAIN that she loved him and to stop, you put in ANOTHER dig about her appeasing your parents? I mean, what did you think was going to happen here? When someone is angry because you are insulting them, their fiance, and their choices, and you continue to criticize instead of respecting their words and backing off, yes, that is toxic.</p>\n\n<p>Are you really surprised she doesn&#39;t want you at the wedding where she&#39;s marrying the man you told her to her face she probably doesn&#39;t love?</p>\n\n<p>YTA.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, sharing a similar background, culture, and religion can form a good base for a healthy relationship, but it doesn't ensure happiness. Taste in movies, tv shows, music, foods, can really cause issues. Having the same goals in life, the same ideas about children and money, these are things that lead to marriages either lasting or failing.\n\nMaybe she only allowed herself to consider men from your area and religion on purpose because she saw you struggle, but that doesn't mean she doesn't truly love her fiance.",

But she\u2019s chosen him, whether you believe she loves him or not. There\u2019s no evidence she\u2019s been coerced in to this by your parents or the man, so she\u2019s chosen him. \n\nMany people fall in love with people from the same community, it\u2019s not that uncommon. I\u2019d say the vast majority of people meet the person they fall in love with somewhere communal, maybe not a religious place sure, but I\u2019d be willing to bet that a vast majority of people meet the people they date not too far from where they live. All of my friends are dating people they met locally, my parents met locally. In fact, only people I know who didn\u2019t meet their significant other personally are my sister and I. \n\nIt sounds you\u2019re a little bitter about the situation you had to go through and that her choice in partner will make your parents far happier than yours. I\u2019d say that\u2019s normal, you\u2019re jealous of the idea that your parents are going to be happier with her than they are/were with you. That\u2019s just part of having siblings, however. You need to apologise for overstepping your boundaries and doubting her. It sucks that you had to go through a struggle to be with the man you love, but you should be happy and thankful that your sister doesn\u2019t have to do the same. \n\nI wish both you and your husband, and your sister and hers, the best of luck for the future.",

A lot of the things you said to your sister seems to circle around your relationship experience and not consider any other types of love. I'm not speaking for your sister or you in anyway, but based on the information here a lot of the things you have said related to \"romanticism.\" Romanticism is really just a trend that morphs over time and varies culture to culture. However the core of romanticism is what I consider classic romance. A man and a woman against all odds find love in the most unexpected way, and they cross oceans and move mountains just to be together. They are \"soulmates\" if you will. Speaking from my own experience, that doesn't work for everyone, and THAT'S OKAY. I find the idea that love can be put on a scale and that types of love are considered better than others is toxic. It doesn't help anyone. It's okay to love someone who has similar goals to you. It's okay to love someone who believes in the same things as you. It's okay to love someone who is a good economic match. It's okay. It's also okay to love someone for any other reason. If it is a mutually beneficial relationship, why not have it. Not everyone is looking for \"prince charming,\" some people want security, some people want a family. And it's all the same love. Whatever your sisters reasoning for loving this man is valid. It doesn't seem that he will bring any trouble to you and your family so why bother judging them for it. I commend you on the personal challenges you faced to marry the person you love, but I also see no reason for you to invalidate your sisters relationship because it is different from yours.",

My mom should have left him a million times over, and I know a big reason she didn&#39;t was probably pride, not wanting to admit her parents were right about him and she was wrong. </p>\n\n<p>But also...so much damage was done to the relationship in the process of her choosing him that it was like you said, she just didn&#39;t have that support system. Well, she had it but refused to use it. To be fair, my grandmother is absolutely the petty type who would have made my mother &quot;eat crow&quot; every single day.</p>\n\n<p>Not saying that&#39;s happening to OP, just saying it happens.</p>\n</div>",
