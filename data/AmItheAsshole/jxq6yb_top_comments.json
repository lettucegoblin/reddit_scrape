My parents were both only children and so were their parents. Both sides of the family had wide gaps between generations (no one under 35 had kids on my mom&#39;s side for example, it was all 35+ for the one birth that happened each generation) and didn&#39;t have data from anyone earlier than that. She didn&#39;t believe that it was possible for someone not to have cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. So she failed my project. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t understand why adoptive family was not allowed.

Yes, they can be super fun for kids who are comfortable with the topic of their family, but it can be a nightmare for other kids.

You cannot complain when they give you the truth, even if it covers death, divorce, or abuse.* \n\nYou did nothing wrong.

Home is where we live. I moved 8 hours away from my family for a reason. The distance has helped heal things, but not enough to go back for a long time without mental health effects (although I had to because my building decided to renovate during a pandemic, but that's another story). \n\nMy friend grew up in a physically abusive home with parents she is now having to support financially (cultural thing - no matter how shitty her parents are, she feels obligated to help and I don't judge her for that. I'm an only child so I'll be caring for my parents as well regardless of history). Reaching out to her family for support is *not* on the table. She also has an autoimmune condition so she's super high risk. Her advisor would recommend she visit family to \"de-stress\" because he couldn't comprehend her family  dynamics. \n\nPeople have a weird \"blind spot\" when it comes to families that is basically willful ignorance. You see it a lot in the JustNo subreddits where SOs don't understand why their partners want *nothing* to do with their family of origin. \n\nMy aunt taught fifth grade for 40 years, starting in inner city Atlanta and then in a poorer area of Appalachia. She learned really quickly not to make assumptions about her students' home lives. She gained a reputation of being able to \"handle\" the \"difficult\" kids (she hated it being phrased that way) because of it. I remember visiting her class when I was in school (different school systems, so we had different breaks). One girl still stands out to me - when she got stressed she would pretend to be a cat and curl up on the floor. My aunt refused to tell me the family history for privacy reasons but made it clear it was *not good* and to let her do her cat thing without comment. The other students didn't seem phased by the cat thing, so I guess they were used to it?\n\nSo, yeah, 100% agree that some educators don't understand their own privilege when it comes to things like this. When I'm teaching, I never make assumptions about my students (undergrads), but sometimes my own (relative) privileges still bite me in the ass. \n\nOP, 100% NTA.",

My college was oddly diverse for a town so small, so we had a lot of different backgrounds participating in this project. One guy traced his family all the way back to the Mayflower.\n\nI'm Black, so it's pretty obvious that I couldn't go past 1865. Several of my classmates come from adoptive/foster families or just have no idea who their parents are. The assignment couldn't be completed as directed.\n\nWhen the next class meeting was held, he explained to us that we're going to run into similar issues in our own classrooms. Our students will come from all walks of life and we have to be mindful and respectful of that.\n\nI do a family tree project every year. (I teach Spanish.) I make sure that the kids know that the purpose of the project is to have them work with the vocabulary. It doesn't have to be their actual family. I show them my actual family tree as an example, and then I also show them the Lion King family tree as an alternative. I've gotten some dope-ass projects as a result. One kid did a poster with tinker bell's family tree. Another just decided that she wanted to use her own family, and substitute the members that she didn't like with some of her favorite celebrities. One child decided to make his family tree out of his favorite teachers and no-so-subtly demonstrate which of us he shipped.\n\nWe should always be sensitive to our students' home lives. That shit is important.\n\nEdit: omfg you guys. I came home from work, (retail, not my teaching job) and I saw all of these lovely and encouraging replies in my inbox and now I'm crying! You guys are so sweet. I often doubt if I'm even a good teacher, but your kid words mean so fucking much. I want to thank all of you individually, but there's way too many and I'm super ready for a nap. Thank you guys so much.

Our students will come from all walks of life and we have to be mindful and respectful of that.</p>\n\n<p>I do a family tree project every year. (I teach Spanish.) I make sure that the kids know that the purpose of the project is to have them work with the vocabulary. It doesn&#39;t have to be their actual family. I show them my actual family tree as an example, and then I also show them the Lion King family tree as an alternative. I&#39;ve gotten some dope-ass projects as a result. One kid did a poster with tinker bell&#39;s family tree. Another just decided that she wanted to use her own family, and substitute the members that she didn&#39;t like with some of her favorite celebrities. One child decided to make his family tree out of his favorite teachers and no-so-subtly demonstrate which of us he shipped.</p>\n\n<p>We should always be sensitive to our students&#39; home lives. That shit is important.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: omfg you guys. I came home from work, (retail, not my teaching job) and I saw all of these lovely and encouraging replies in my inbox and now I&#39;m crying! You guys are so sweet. I often doubt if I&#39;m even a good teacher, but your kid words mean so fucking much. I want to thank all of you individually, but there&#39;s way too many and I&#39;m super ready for a nap. Thank you guys so much. And if any of you have questions about teaching or anything, my inbox is open.</p>\n</div>",

Basically you just had to say in French that you had a mother, father, siblings and pets. \n\nShe pulled the girl to the side and told her, not very quietly unfortunately, that she was excused from that exercise and could do something else in its place. It did soften my view of her a bit that she was compassionate enough to realise that this might be too tough for the girl. Sadly, there are a lot of teachers who don't care at all.

Our school was extremely anti-racist. I had a much better understanding of America&#39;s racism than many of my peers when I went to a predominantly white public high school. We also learned about many different religions and were taught to respect other people&#39;s faiths. Sexism was also not tolerated.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t perfect, but, in many regards, my school did try to foster empathy.</p>\n</div>",

Because it was a religious school, I was one of the few kids attending who had divorced parents. Both my mother and father had remarried, so I had four parents total. I'd been attending the school since I was 7 or 8, and the entire time my parents had been divorced. Both of them got remarried before I'd entered 4th grade. The administration planning my graduation ceremony were the same people who had founded the school - they'd been there for my entire time, and knew me and my family quite personally.   \nSo we get to graduation, and every year they bought roses for the kids to give to their mothers in thanks. I thought nothing of it because, again, tiny school, they've known me basically my whole life, they know I have two moms. We get to the rose part and.... they only had one for each kid. I had to walk into the crowd and give both of my moms a singular rose. It had to have been a bit of a slap in the face for my stepmom. I felt horrible. I still don't understand how it didn't occur to them that I might need a second rose. People are clueless.",

        "body": "It's funny, we're in a private school, and the contract lays out how much volunteering is 'required' - 6 hours a year from EACH PARENT LISTED ... So if you're a single, it's 6 hours. If you're two divorced and remarried, it's 6 hours x 4. If steps don't want to be listed as parents, that's fine, but that means they don't come to parent meetings/can't be listed as parents to notify. \n\nThe volunteering is basically two hours to prep the big school fair at in December, and then two hours setting up/running/tearing down the fair (and they provide childcare if you need it), and then two more setting up/tearing down the spring event. Technically I do my husband's two 'prep' hours... I make little fairy dolls for prizes, and I do them over the course of the year (he gets all my supplies, so that's his part) - but if you try and take your spouse's in-person hours they get REALLY cranky. Our Grade One teacher actually laid into a dad who decided to announce (at a class parent meeting) that he was too busy to give up his free time. I believe the phrases 'grow up and be a role model' and 'so you're ok teaching your daughter that she should expect to do her work AND her spouse's' were tossed around.\n\nEdited to add: I should note that it probably wasn't the 'I'm too busy' part that set off the teacher, it was the 'that's what stay at home moms are for' part that I think set her right off.",

And obviously, we couldn't do that in order to try to make it more inclusive.  So, I focused on my daughter's middle school and managed to raise more money my first year than had been raised before.

By the time my son was in middle school, that fundraiser had made so much money that the requests from teachers for things for their classroom (which is what the money funded) were almost zero because over the years, they'd had all their requests funded (the first year or two we had to budget and only fund the most important items).  So suck it Ustick Elementary!  Just because I wasn't a stay-at-home mom did not mean I was not capable of doing a bang up job on the PTA.",
