How could they think this is okay?? </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I get married in 14 days and honestly would have a COW if someone showed up to my wedding in white and I BET they would too if it was theirs. Most women would. Why they think this is just a prank is beyond me. </p></li>\n<li><p>They took their treatment to your wife above and beyond what they\u2019ve done to the other women in your family. They didn\u2019t stop after a few months, they bullied her BEHIND YOUR BACK- it\u2019s not teasing at that point, it\u2019s DEFINITELY bullying- they went against your wishes, and you WARNED them before hand and they lied to your face. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your reaction is completely justified and they need to be taught a lesson.</p>\n</div>",

You may have stuck up for your wife when it meant the most but the fact that you\u2019re even subjecting her to this constant emotional and mental abuse makes you an asshole.\n\nI would seriously consider cutting these women out of your life. You bang on about them being toxic but other than telling them to stop and seeing first hand that they don\u2019t give a shit what you say and finding that they CONTINUE full force you\u2019ve done nothing to really protect her from them. You keep bringing the lamb to the slaughter and blaming the axe instead of looking at how your actions drug her to the chopping block.\n\nYou\u2019re basically shouting at a fire that keeps burning your wife instead of getting a goddamn extinguisher and putting it out.\n\nShe is going to break eventually. I don\u2019t mean break and join them, but break down. That kind of bullying doesn\u2019t just roll off the back. It\u2019s calculated, constant.

No. They\u2019re going to come back so much worse than before.\n\nCut them out before you lose your wife.
