I find it hard to believe you act so disgusted that your daughter said those words, yet this topic was never discussed.  Is it something to be swept under the rug, or is it a respectful profession?  Because you need to make up your mind right now as you have sent incredibly mixed signals to your daughter.  You have punished her harshly for using those words, yet you yourself act as if it\u2019s inappropriate by concealing this.  How you deal with this is your choice; as a parent myself I won\u2019t tell you what to do, but if you plan on instilling values in your child you need to commit to one way or the other.\n\nPeople have already explained it but I\u2019ll add this:  your SIL consented to being recognized by others the day she showed her face on video.  I feel like it\u2019s completely unrealistic to think that you can make a living in porn and will never be recognized by anyone, ever.  Does it suck? Yes.  Was it bound to happen if she\u2019s in videos that are popular enough to be seen by some teenage boy? Yeah, it was.  Privacy, in general, is scarce nowadays.  Expecting anonymity in a profession where you regularly show your face in media that, by definition, will be viewed by others is completely unreasonable, porn or not.  \n\nPlease note: I am VERY pro-sexwork to the point I\u2019ve written an academic essay on legalization in a regular English class.  In my mind, the stigma of  legal, pro-woman sexwork is deplorable and contributes to violence.  However, in our cultural climate it is a very real part of the industry and I can\u2019t imagine your SIL didn\u2019t think this through and expect it one day.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA.  You did not prepare or protect your daughter in any way in regards to this.  If you think what she said was bad, just imagine what kids are saying to her at school.  I find it hard to believe you act so disgusted that your daughter said those words, yet this topic was never discussed.  Is it something to be swept under the rug, or is it a respectful profession?  Because you need to make up your mind right now as you have sent incredibly mixed signals to your daughter.  You have punished her harshly for using those words, yet you yourself act as if it\u2019s inappropriate by concealing this.  How you deal with this is your choice; as a parent myself I won\u2019t tell you what to do, but if you plan on instilling values in your child you need to commit to one way or the other.</p>\n\n<p>People have already explained it but I\u2019ll add this:  your SIL consented to being recognized by others the day she showed her face on video.  I feel like it\u2019s completely unrealistic to think that you can make a living in porn and will never be recognized by anyone, ever.  Does it suck? Yes.  Was it bound to happen if she\u2019s in videos that are popular enough to be seen by some teenage boy? Yeah, it was.  Privacy, in general, is scarce nowadays.  Expecting anonymity in a profession where you regularly show your face in media that, by definition, will be viewed by others is completely unreasonable, porn or not.  </p>\n\n<p>Please note: I am VERY pro-sexwork to the point I\u2019ve written an academic essay on legalization in a regular English class.  In my mind, the stigma of  legal, pro-woman sexwork is deplorable and contributes to violence.  However, in our cultural climate it is a very real part of the industry and I can\u2019t imagine your SIL didn\u2019t think this through and expect it one day.</p>\n</div>",

You'd rather she support the pornographic exploitation of women that she sees her male classmates build expectations around -- after all, this whole thing started because a 14 year old boy was such a grizzled veteran of porn that he recognized your SiL -- than speak her mind.

The world is much more visible (good and bad) and accessible to your daughter then when you were a kid. Your daughter is not opening up to you **because she doesn't trust how you will handle the situation**. Which means she won't trust you with other things like sex. Getting the boys name? again this isn't the 90s, she will be butchered at that age for motherly intervention, or for direct school involvement. She isn't 5. What on earth do you think the school is going to do? this is the real world, kids are going to bypass whatever authority you attempt to implement. Kids are cruel and ruthless at that age and they will talk all over school about all of this.  **Whatever she told you is happening to her, its likely far worse then you can imagine**, she doesn't want to alarm you and invoke heavy action. **She is a VICTIM** in this scenario of the kind of life altering harassment. Kids are likely calling her names, some of her friends are likely betraying her, sex shaming her, plus the boys are likely eating her alive. Imagine being 14, romantic relationships are a thing and new, you have no idea what the fuck any of it is, new body hormones, your life is literally just an awkward state 24/7 of trying to figure things out, filled with awkward mistakes, existence sucks and is hard, you have all the suck with none of the fun. Kids are shitty and cliquey at this age anyway and its fucking hard to simply exist unnoticed at this age. Kids have to leave school to avoid bullying from things like pimples and body odors. The average maturity level your dealing with is a classroom that laughs when somebody says penis, where periods are gross and wtf, and boys are trying to pretend to be men, in all the worst ways. Shes likely had no to few sexual experiences, and now boys, some of whom she was likely interested in or potentially interested in to some degree, are taunting and **showing her extremely explicit things**, the type of things that make porn hub titles look G rated. **She needed you the most and you hurt her. This is the type of shit that leads you to distrust all authority figures and encourage years of self destructive rebellion.** \n\nIMO You need to: \n\n* empathize with the total destruction of her social life because of something outside of her control \n* adjust the grounding time to be more reasonable with 2019, clarify the reasoning behind the grounding to be much more clear and maybe even get rid of it as what are you accomplishing? \n* apologize to your daughter for how you handled the situation and what she is going through\n* counseling\n* attempt to foster a better more open relationship built on trust - **INCLUDING t**rusting your daughter more in how she wants to deal with these things**.** \n* Begin to adjust your parenting perspective to be less authoritative and more of a guide role, you are creating an adult and want her to function as one. She is at the age where you have little to no control over what she does and if you act otherwise she is going to rebel and do self harming things just to spite you. \n* related to the above - stop attempting to pressure her with your opinion/perspective, you can merely advice at this point as she forms her own view based on experiences going forward. \n\nBottom line - she isn't a child anymore. Much more like a immature, irresponsible, risk taking mini adult. I think given time/room to process and heal properly she will come to value her relationship with your SIL, realize its not her fault the world is Shiite and apologize for her actions. I wish you the best with this and future growing pains.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA. Its not 1990s anymore when you were a kid. That &quot;language&quot; used used on youtube, commercials on the radio/youtube, twitter, facebook ect. The world is much more visible (good and bad) and accessible to your daughter then when you were a kid. Your daughter is not opening up to you <strong>because she doesn&#39;t trust how you will handle the situation</strong>. Which means she won&#39;t trust you with other things like sex. Getting the boys name? again this isn&#39;t the 90s, she will be butchered at that age for motherly intervention, or for direct school involvement. She isn&#39;t 5. What on earth do you think the school is going to do? this is the real world, kids are going to bypass whatever authority you attempt to implement. Kids are cruel and ruthless at that age and they will talk all over school about all of this.  <strong>Whatever she told you is happening to her, its likely far worse then you can imagine</strong>, she doesn&#39;t want to alarm you and invoke heavy action. <strong>She is a VICTIM</strong> in this scenario of the kind of life altering harassment. Kids are likely calling her names, some of her friends are likely betraying her, sex shaming her, plus the boys are likely eating her alive. Imagine being 14, romantic relationships are a thing and new, you have no idea what the fuck any of it is, new body hormones, your life is literally just an awkward state 24/7 of trying to figure things out, filled with awkward mistakes, existence sucks and is hard, you have all the suck with none of the fun. Kids are shitty and cliquey at this age anyway and its fucking hard to simply exist unnoticed at this age. Kids have to leave school to avoid bullying from things like pimples and body odors. The average maturity level your dealing with is a classroom that laughs when somebody says penis, where periods are gross and wtf, and boys are trying to pretend to be men, in all the worst ways.

YOU and your husband threw your own daughter under the bus when you \n\n1. Profess support of sex worker industry, while in reality keep it a dirty secret in your daughter\u2019s life.  \n\n2.  Covering up #1 with absurd logic that you\u2019re protecting SIL\u2019s privacy.  It\u2019s a joke and thank god no one here is buying it.  There is no privacy to protect.  It\u2019s called SHAME and YOU need to own it.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE- I\u2019m not saying sex work is bad- I\u2019M NOT.  - I\u2019m saying OP is ashamed is disguising their shame under the fake noble cause of \u201cprotecting SIL\u2019s privacy \u201c and it\u2019s bs. \n\n3. You\u2019re such a coward that you pretend to support sex industry, but don\u2019t tell your daughter about it, which is lying by omission, leaving your daughter to find out from others.  \n\nSo your daughter finds out her parents have no integrity, neither does her aunt, everyone lied to her except the kid at school.  \n\n4. Then all of a sudden you get big balls and ground your daughter????  \n\nYou\u2019re a coward and are taking your shortcomings out on your child.  Try some personal accountability.  \n\nDon\u2019t pretend for a second that you\u2019ve been preaching sex positive messages as part of your family value system when in reality it\u2019s quite the opposite- you\u2019ve been hiding it.  \n\nNow you expect your daughter to have more integrity than you? She already does.  At least she stands up for what she believes in and is consistent.  \n\nFor you to magnify your daughter saying a few bad words is even more embarrassing on your part.  Way to take the focus off yourself and blame your daughter.  \n\nOh here comes that bus again- get ready to push your daughter under it!",

YOU and your husband threw your own daughter under the bus when you </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Profess support of sex worker industry, while in reality keep it a dirty secret in your daughter\u2019s life.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Covering up #1 with absurd logic that you\u2019re protecting SIL\u2019s privacy.  It\u2019s a joke and thank god no one here is buying it.  There is no privacy to protect.  It\u2019s called SHAME and YOU need to own it.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>PLEASE NOTE- I\u2019m not saying sex work is bad- I\u2019M NOT.  - I\u2019m saying OP is ashamed is disguising their shame under the fake noble cause of \u201cprotecting SIL\u2019s privacy \u201c and it\u2019s bs. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You\u2019re such a coward that you pretend to support sex industry, but don\u2019t tell your daughter about it, which is lying by omission, leaving your daughter to find out from others.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So your daughter finds out her parents have no integrity, neither does her aunt, everyone lied to her except the kid at school.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Then all of a sudden you get big balls and ground your daughter????<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You\u2019re a coward and are taking your shortcomings out on your child.  Try some personal accountability.  </p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t pretend for a second that you\u2019ve been preaching sex positive messages as part of your family value system when in reality it\u2019s quite the opposite- you\u2019ve been hiding it.  </p>\n\n<p>Now you expect your daughter to have more integrity than you? She already does.  At least she stands up for what she believes in and is consistent.  </p>\n\n<p>For you to magnify your daughter saying a few bad words is even more embarrassing on your part.  Way to take the focus off yourself and blame your daughter.  </p>\n\n<p>Oh here comes that bus again- get ready to push your daughter under it!</p>\n</div>",

At a previous job I had working with 6th graders, I would be a stand in position as a witness between kids, parents, and a coordinator and some of the stuff parents would threaten their children with would kill me inside.\n\nI had one boy who was dealing with a lot of anger and expressing it negativity with name calling, non compliance, etc... We at the camp handled it with discussion, reflection, and he had a lot of positive improvement from that! However, at some point he did something that was a instant send home and we had to notify his parents that they would need to come pick him up. I was in the room while a supervisor was on the phone with the mom. When they finished talking, the lady handed the phone to the boy so his mom could talk to him.\n\nJust barely I could hear what she was saying, and this mom was threatening everything \"I swear to God I'm going to take away your skateboard, TV, internet, phone, you will never go outside, etc.. for the whole summer\" and I was just blown away. This poor kid seriously just needed support, love, and a caring environment. Instead, he just kept getting told how bad he was and it's his fault, and you could just see where a lot of his problems rooted from.\n\nParents like OP and future parents, please understand your kid is not some animal that needs to be \"trained\" to act in a certain way like a cat and a squirt bottle. They are their own complex selves with emotions, goals, problems, and soul. You can't just take away essentially their life and expect them to all of the sudden be perfect. You need to put in actual time into discussing issues that come up, finding appropriate methods for helping them grow, and most of all being flexible to help guide them in the right direction.\n\nDoes the child I mentioned above deserve some punishment? Of course. However, the extreme level it goes to (Look at it from his perspective, literally his life is gone) completely ignores the root problem, and that is that he needs professional help, guidance, and a loving support structure to safely make mistake and learn from the experience positively. Lazy parenting may give you 5 minutes of relief, but can easily spiral into long term problems and cause irreversible damage.",

That's 100% your fault for pushing her. She's having to deal with constant abuse from the kids at school and her only form of self release and comfort is in the form of escapism. What exactly do you expect her to do without the internet? Stare at the wall? Clearly social interaction between her peers is only going to cause her to feel further and further anxiety and aggression towards her aunt and those that harass her. You punished your daughter by taking away her only form of relief when she was being punished by all her peers for your aunts choices, because you disliked her 'hurting your aunts feelings' by not being around her. She can choose who to be around. How on earth did you expect it to end positively by trying to FORCE interaction with who is essentially the ammunition her peers use to hurt her with? Do you know anything about Associative behavior? Her mind knows the source of the insults and jeering is her aunt therefore her mind is going to automatically associate all those negative emotions to her aunt. While it isn't her aunt jeering her, her past behavior is the source of it. And you're essentially trying to get her to interact with the source of all the negativity that's being used against her. How on earth do you expect that to end positively? That's like forcing someone to face their trauma. Your SIL's a grown woman, not 14, she's not being bullied only ignored she needs to grow up and accept some people won't like or want to be around her. If you ACTUALLY cared for your daughter and wanted to help her and her mindset, you'd try to be a source of comfort for her, you'd be there as an ear and someone she can have social interaction with since she can't get it from her schoolmates instead of adding to her mental distress. And THEN you'd slowly try to explain over time in a caring manner how her aunt didn't try to directly hurt her and how kids are just assholes and will use anything to hurt someone while listening and trying to relate and sympathize with her and the problems she's facing. If you did this right you could have slowly diffused her from anxiety that she associates with her aunt and she would have been far more willing to return to interacting with her. But you really didn't care about her mental state you just felt bad because your SIL felt hurt. YTA.\n\nAnd 3 Months of no Internet? I'd call you a massive asshole for taking it away for 3 days. I'm seriously wondering what exactly you expect your daughter to do without her escapism when social interaction is obviously causing her alot of distress.",

An aspect of someone else's life that she has no influence, control, or even prior knowledge of, is RUINING her self-esteem. And a teen's self-esteem is a very fragile thing--not to mention its crucial to healthy social development.\n\nSo sure, a harsh lesson might have to be taught. But in this situation? When she's been caught up in a storm and has been given zero support so far? I mean, hell, calling her aunt a slut was awful, but it got OPs attention finally, didn't it?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Parenting means teaching tough lessons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yea, but the whole concern in this situation is that, while a tough lesson is being/should be taught, the daughter is receiving no support. An aspect of someone else&#39;s life that she has no influence, control, or even prior knowledge of, is RUINING her self-esteem. And a teen&#39;s self-esteem is a very fragile thing--not to mention its crucial to healthy social development.</p>\n\n<p>So sure, a harsh lesson might have to be taught. But in this situation? When she&#39;s been caught up in a storm and has been given zero support so far? I mean, hell, calling her aunt a slut was awful, but it got OPs attention finally, didn&#39;t it? It was a cry for help because her entire world is against her right now.
