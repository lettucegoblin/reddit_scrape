My friends mom could tell we were nervous about something and decided that reading her diary would give her the answers she needed. She said she was \"concerned about her daughter's behavior\". In it was something my friend and I did at school (we wrote all over the bathroom stalls. Which in my school were prestine). Her mom went to the school to have a talk about her daughter's behavior with the principal. The principal was confused as to how she knew what we did, because she swore to us to not tell our parents, provided we did the tasks set as punishment for a week, which we did. When she told the principal she read he daughter's diary and read about the shit we did, the principal flipped  her shit (all my friend's mom's words by the way). I remember my her saying \"I felt like a little kid being scolded for reading the diary and found herself scared as if she was a kid again and in Trouble\".\n\nMy friend and I already got punished and had to clean up the writing and stay late in school to help a teacher set up for the boarding school kids meals. The way they caught us was, they locked the bathroom the next day before students showed up and took exam books from every 7th-10th grader and compared the handwriting. My friend not being smart about it, used her handwriting instead of block writing like I did. A week later my friend was called out of class. These teachers were very dedicated to finding the culprits and we were left shitting bricks, knowing it was just a matter of time before we'd get busted. Kowing what it was about and not allowing my friend to get punished alone for something I was part in, I followed her into the principal's office. It actually is the reason we didn't get a harsher punishment. The fact that as friends we had each others backs like that. The principal was proud that I didn't let her take the fall on her own.\n\nThe principal was a  boss. She tore my friend's mom a new one for reading her diary and asked her if she would like her privacy invaded like that. She also told her mom that it's behavior like hers that cause girls our age not to ever trust our parents again when it comed to privacy. \n\nShe literally had my friends mom write a short essay on how her behavior could ruin the trust between her and her daughter and made her turn it in.\n\nMonths later, I remember, she told us about all of it and she said she was shocked that she found herself actually writing the essay and turning it in. It made her see her daughter's point of view very clearly and she never touched the diary again. \nShe apologized so profusely to my friend and I for snooping into something that the principal found helpful for girls to have. Somewhere to write down the things we don't want to share yet. Because diaries will eventually become public knowledge (in most cases). Once you grow up, it's not uncommon to tell your family \"oh man, I was re-reading my old diary and you won't believe the shit we did. We did \"X, Y, Z\".\nBut according to the principal,  it was up to my friend to share these stories once they were no longer needing to be a secret and not a tool for mom to find out what her daughter may be up to.\nI had the greatest respect for the principal after that. Not only did she flip her shit after hearing my friend's mom invaded her privacy, she also made her write an essay on the importance for girls our age to keep a diary and learn from the  mistakes we made, all while writing it down with the expectation that a diary is sacred and should never be read by anyone unless the owner of said diary wants to share a particular story or to use it as an outlet to rant and vent about people.  She then made the mom confess to my friend what she had done. \n\nI still remember the look of remorse on the mom's face when she fessed up.\n\nHilariously, friend's mom got a B- on her essay.  Hahaha.\n\nEdit: I had 2 brothers that would have had no remorse at all reading about my most private things so I never kept a diary\n My friend kept up her diary writing until she finishes school after 13th grade and got a job. She told me later that she never had to hide her diary again because she knew her mom would never dare to read it again.",

I was not concerned with my husband finding it (we have very good communication and he knew what I was dealing with, sometimes I'd let/make him read some of it when I couldn't say my feelings out loud) so it was put up but not hidden. \n\nMy poor kid at about 2-years-old was looking for paper to color and drug my journal out to the living room. Big problem was that we had guests at the time, including my meth-head BIL. He figured out from my reaction that it was private so he snatched it from my kid and started reading it out loud. His gf of the week looked *horrified* and walked out as soon as she realized what he was reading (I liked her but never saw her again lol). My husband hit his brother in the gut just hard enough to catch him off guard and grabbed my journal back and kicked him out, but honestly, the damage was done- I cried for days, burned my journal and haven't been able to start a new one since.\n\nOn the flip side I was cleaning up my bonus-daughter's stuff once, packing her a bag to go to her mom's (she was 14 but I had permission since she was at school) and I accidentally found her journal. Unfortunately, her mom was here when I found it and tried to take it from me and read it (\"it's *my* daughter so I have every right!) Luckily it was written in a spiral notebook that I happened to have another of in the same color. I made her mom believe it was the journal when I threw it in the fire we had going. I lost notes on about 15 different crochet projects and a few recipes, and it was totally worth it to save my kid from the same bs I went through.",

That was the day I sorted out my sock drawer and I did a pretty good job of it too. Although I got a couple of my white socks mixed up because when it came to putting them on, a couple had ribs that didn\u2019t quite match up. How embarrassing was that! Yes.
