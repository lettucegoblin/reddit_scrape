My father ended up marrying the woman that insulted me behind his back every chance she got. \"Just so you know, you look like Dora\" \"Hi Hagrid, bad hair day today?\" Were very common. My dad's wife made the same promises your fiance did, and that ended badly. Needless to say, it got to the point where she was so horrible with her comments that my dad \"couldn't possibly believe\" she was saying those things. I ended up cutting both of them out of my life. I was sick of being called a liar and standing up for myself all the time. I was sick of being let down by my father and not feeling heard or supported. Don't be my dad, and don't let this woman berate your daughter behind closed doors. NTA, but you will be if you think your fiance actually cares about Judy's feelings after all this.",

We're getting married soon, I've only met her family a couple of times. My daughter \"Judy\" F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time.\n\nJudy has a visible burns car on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and UT was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.\n\n\nWe got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending  y fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to \"photoshop\" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nothing. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said \"yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now\".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.\n\nObviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even \"saying goodbye\", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was teased for being a stereotypical,extremely awkward freckled redhead, with thick glasses topped off with ADHD and crippling shyness.  When people teased me I&#39;d completely shut down.  I&#39;m so very proud and touched by you and your daughter being able to communicate like this.  I didn&#39;t have that.  Based on my experiences with people like this I feel you should talk more to your daughter.  Is it possible that your fiance has hinted at this type of behavior and nothing was said to you? </p>\n\n<p>Please err on the side of keeping your daughter safe.  My family didn&#39;t and I&#39;m only now, in my 40s, starting to realize how much I ignored and internalized as a child to not rock the boat.</p>\n</div>",

She DID get mad at YOU for &quot;disrespecting&quot; her parents, victim blamed Judy, and then had the audacity to claim the whole thing was a joke (as if that makes it any better). </p>\n\n<p>If after several conversations, this is all you&#39;re getting\u2013no acknowledgment, no SINCERE apologies from your fiancee and her parents, no attempt to rectify the situation\u2013it seems like you have your answer. These are toxic people.</p>\n</div>",

Every interaction from now on will result in Judy feeling uncomfortable and hyper aware of what they think of her. As someone this used to happen to, it will really harm her self image, self esteem, and trust in you eventually as you are allowing her to still be around these horrible people. This was not a slip, this wasn\u2019t unexpected. Guaranteed your fianc\u00e9 and her mom have been gearing up to ask these things and it\u2019s easier for you to be mad at FMIL than fianc\u00e9. You have seen first hand that your fianc\u00e9 allowed this and justified the behavior, then gaslit you to believe you\u2019re at fault for what her family did to your CHILD. Not an adult. Not a friend of yours, your child. \nSecond, you\u2019ve done amazing as helping just to grown self awareness and an ability to express her feelings. I really commend you. But don\u2019t stifle this by staying with a woman that openly belittled her through her silence and her family\u2019s blatant remarks. This would be a deal breaker for me, at that, but then her behavior following would be the nail in the coffin. It is better to choose a new life with you and Judy than try and patch this because you will compromise your daughter in that process, even if you don\u2019t mean to. Choose your kid first, say goodbye to fianc\u00e9 citing foundational differences in respect, and don\u2019t marry this woman. If you leave, your daughter will always have respect for you and you will also teach her exactly what she can accept and reject from others in the future. It\u2019s going to hurt you for a bit and it\u2019s complicated, but as a fellow parent, I would leave someone in a heartbeat if this happened to my kid.",

You have seen first hand that your fianc\u00e9 allowed this and justified the behavior, then gaslit you to believe you\u2019re at fault for what her family did to your CHILD. Not an adult. Not a friend of yours, your child. \nSecond, you\u2019ve done amazing as helping just to grown self awareness and an ability to express her feelings. I really commend you. But don\u2019t stifle this by staying with a woman that openly belittled her through her silence and her family\u2019s blatant remarks. This would be a deal breaker for me, at that, but then her behavior following would be the nail in the coffin. It is better to choose a new life with you and Judy than try and patch this because you will compromise your daughter in that process, even if you don\u2019t mean to. Choose your kid first, say goodbye to fianc\u00e9 citing foundational differences in respect, and don\u2019t marry this woman. If you leave, your daughter will always have respect for you and you will also teach her exactly what she can accept and reject from others in the future. It\u2019s going to hurt you for a bit and it\u2019s complicated, but as a fellow parent, I would leave someone in a heartbeat if this happened to my kid.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Hey OP. I am 33F and have had my facial difference since I was 10 years old. First and foremost: 100% NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. Please talk to your fiancee about whether it would be best to even include MIL in your wedding day. Even at 33 I would have a hard time being around such a person (at least not without saying something cutting enough to completely humiliate them) - at 16 I would have found it impossible. Your daughter needs to feel that both you and her future stepmother are her biggest advocates and cheerleaders. \n\nI can completely relate to Judy's struggles as my facial difference started just before puberty and going through my teens with my face not looking like everyone else's was so hard.\n\nI'm not sure where you live but there are organizations for people with facial differences that may offer your daughter a sense of community and understanding - About Face out of Toronto, Ontario ([https://www.aboutface.ca/](https://www.aboutface.ca/)), Changing Faces in the UK ([https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/](https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/)), The Children's Craniofacial Association which I believe is US based ([https://ccakids.org/](https://ccakids.org/)), and Face Equality International ([https://faceequalityinternational.org/](https://faceequalityinternational.org/))\n\nThere are also several people on TikTok and Instagram (assuming your daughter uses either platform) that have facial differences and are using their platforms for advocacy and awareness. Off the top of my head there is TheHealingHeart1 on IG (goes by The Healing Heart on TT, I believe), ByBrittanyLeigh on IG, FaceItMama on IG/TT, and CarlyFindlay on IG.\n\nPlease feel free to DM me or respond to this comment here if there is anything else I can help with. Much love to you and your daughter.\n\n**Edited to add**: I read some more of OPs comments and re-read the post (I\"m v. tired today so some details got past me) - OP, I would strongly suggest you reconsider this relationship as a whole. As I said, your daughter needs to feel both you **and** her future stepmom are her biggest advocates. We with facial differences are already part of a society that rejects us *constantly* \\- we are not well-represented in media (we either aren't represented at all or are just represented as villains) and your daughter doesn't need to feel that shame, rejection, and discomfort in her own home with her own family. (It is also worth noting that having this type of difference is particularly difficult for girls and women because we are told from a young age that our value is directly tied to our appearance.) We are part of the disabled community and your fiancee's dismissive attitude of your daughter's difference is very much NOT okay. If she is unwilling to change then you need to make the best choice for your child.\n\n*I also want to thank everyone who has read this comment and upvoted and for everyone who gave me awards. It's truly so touching. Love ya'll.*",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey OP. I am 33F and have had my facial difference since I was 10 years old. First and foremost: 100% NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. Please talk to your fiancee about whether it would be best to even include MIL in your wedding day. Even at 33 I would have a hard time being around such a person (at least not without saying something cutting enough to completely humiliate them) - at 16 I would have found it impossible. Your daughter needs to feel that both you and her future stepmother are her biggest advocates and cheerleaders. </p>\n\n<p>I can completely relate to Judy&#39;s struggles as my facial difference started just before puberty and going through my teens with my face not looking like everyone else&#39;s was so hard.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure where you live but there are organizations for people with facial differences that may offer your daughter a sense of community and understanding - About Face out of Toronto, Ontario (<a href=\"https://www.aboutface.ca/\">https://www.aboutface.ca/</a>), Changing Faces in the UK (<a href=\"https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/\">https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/</a>), The Children&#39;s Craniofacial Association which I believe is US based (<a href=\"https://ccakids.org/\">https://ccakids.org/</a>), and Face Equality International (<a href=\"https://faceequalityinternational.org/\">https://faceequalityinternational.org/</a>)</p>\n\n<p>There are also several people on TikTok and Instagram (assuming your daughter uses either platform) that have facial differences and are using their platforms for advocacy and awareness. Off the top of my head there is TheHealingHeart1 on IG (goes by The Healing Heart on TT, I believe), ByBrittanyLeigh on IG, FaceItMama on IG/TT, and CarlyFindlay on IG.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to DM me or respond to this comment here if there is anything else I can help with. Much love to you and your daughter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited to add</strong>: I read some more of OPs comments and re-read the post (I&quot;m v. tired today so some details got past me) - OP, I would strongly suggest you reconsider this relationship as a whole. As I said, your daughter needs to feel both you <strong>and</strong> her future stepmom are her biggest advocates. We with facial differences are already part of a society that rejects us <em>constantly</em> - we are not well-represented in media (we either aren&#39;t represented at all or are just represented as villains) and your daughter doesn&#39;t need to feel that shame, rejection, and discomfort in her own home with her own family.
