As a matter of general principle, I would choose the wedding over the vacation 9 times out of 10, but this is the rare one time I wouldn't.\n\nI don't really care if your SIL has gotten \"closer\" with someone over the past year and wants to replace you with her. She made a commitment to you, and you made a commitment to her by buying the dress and making preparations to attend. From the fickleness with which she treats this whole situation, my bet is she won't be friends with her in a few years anyway, given how quickly she went from stranger to bridesmaid (granted, she's also family). To add insult to injury, she didn't want to let you return the dress, and asked you to give it to her new bridesmaid. I'm glad you stuck to your guns and got your money back, because it's entirely fair.\n\nBecause your brother is family and it'd still be nice to attend the wedding as a guest, despite the insults I might have still gone if nothing else conflicted. That said, if you go on this trip to Miami and they found out that's what you did instead of attending the wedding, do know that there will be some fallout from that. Whether justified or not, I'm guessing they won't be too happy, and your other family members will probably give you grief over it. It sounds like you're at a point where you're prepared to burn that familial bridge, but when your parents pass away and if there's some kind of estate to bicker over, you can bet this will be raised again. Sometimes it's necessary to bring a conflict to a head, and I expect that this will bring it closer to that point.",

And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "Seriously. It all screams that they were just using her. Reminds me of how I invited one specific brother and sister to my wedding (my brother I was super close with and my sister's children are around my age and we also grew up fairly close). My brother is literal the only person besides my daughter in our wedding party (my brother walked me down the aisle). Anyway, the day of my wedding was a 500 year flood. We went to the mountains and I just told anyone that only they could decide if it was safe for them to attend or not. \n\nMy nephew (aforementioned sister's son) and his wife called me multiple times to see if they should come or not - they lived about 35 min from our wedding location. I had been a huge supporter of their wedding and helped them a bit about 2 years prior when they had setup a business (I did a lot of tech work for free), but knew a lot of random bridges were unusable, so i wasn't upset or anything if some people couldn't get to the ceremony. They didn't make it. No biggie. \n\nAnyway... we married outside a casino town, and were planning on having dinner and fun after the wedding for some hours with some of our guests who were staying the weekend there. My sister invites my husband and I to a big dinner, and we are so excited to go (just goofing and loving running around in full gown/suits lol), and was completely shocked to see my nephew and his wife walk up to our celebration dinner. They act surprised we are there and said they left our gift and card at home. Didn't once apologize for constantly calling me while I was trying to get ready, nor for not showing up. I then overhear that they came simply to see my brother. I was livid. We had an amazing dinner and wedding and rest of the night, but I can't forgive him and his wife. It's been nearly a decade and it still upsets me. I'm close to my nephew's age, we spent many summers together, and he often told me of times he remembered me as a baby. I thought he loved me. I had thought I was important to him. Apparently, only my brother was though. That's what hurts most. I just cannot forgive that.",

There were bridesmaids, junior bridesmaids, flower girls, and junior flower girls.  The junior flower girls were really too young to be in a wedding party (age 2) and they got cranky and fell asleep during the ceremony.  I'm not even sure what was happening on the male side.    \n\n\nFast forward to when one of those \"junior bridesmaids\", my daughter, is getting married.  She and her fianc\u00e9 have small wedding parties.  The fiance has some men, some women, and one person who is not sure which gender, if any, they will show up as.  They can wear whatever they want, but purple is the groom's favorite color and the bride's side is a rather dusky rose.  There is one flower girl, age 5.  The ring is carried by the bride's cute little dog, being led by the bride's sister.    \n\n\nBut SIL is not happy.  Shouldn't my kids be in the bridal party, she asks me.  She even called me once, out of the blue, and asked, \"are you really sure your daughter doesn't want to include my kids in the bridal party?  I just want to be sure\".  Her kids are fine, but an awkward tween age where they probably don't want to parade around, although her son wanted to walk the ring bearer/dog.  Sorry!  We don't all want a small army and all the titles that go with it.",

The time comes she gets engaged and I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m MOH or bridesmaid, just excited for you.\u201d She was happy (sister was MOH, I would be bridesmaid, she had to figure out the rest) and then a few weeks later tells me that her husband-to-be has just one groomsman and he wants the sides to be even so I\u2019m not a bridesmaid officially but I could still fly out early and help her as if I was. Okay\u2026\n\nLater fianc\u00e9 decides he wants his brother too after all, and wants her other sister that **he\u2019s** pretty close with to even out the numbers because BIL (her husband) is officiating the wedding and family is just SO important to him. THEN he decides that his sisters are disappointed that his brother and her siblings are in the wedding, so NOW apparently it was fine that there are two groomsmen and four bridesmaids?? At this point I\u2019m annoyed but still planning on coming to the wedding because I know he\u2019s reeeeally close with his family.\n\nMeanwhile, bestie\u2019s lovely roommate is basically doing all the bridesmaid-type duties because bestie\u2019s MOH sister (and I) are still in another country, her other sister has two young kids, and fianc\u00e9\u2019s sisters are useless. Then a couple months before the wedding I find out that fianc\u00e9 has decided that since roomie was so very helpful throughout (and is now engaged to the best man!) she has been added to the wedding party which is now 2-5. And she is still expecting me to come early and help as if I was a bridesmaid but not actually be one. In the end I was like fuck it and told them \u201csorry, I can\u2019t afford it, I\u2019m not coming.\u201d He clearly disliked me and forced me out with excuses and she let him go along with it.
