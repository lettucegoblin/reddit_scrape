Lines like this are the reason I tend to avoid even leaving the house on Mother's Day. \n\n(Note to the general public: please stop asking strangers if they've wished their mom a happy mother's day. You never know for whom it might be a traumatic subject.)\n\nSomeone like your friend, who has been through her own abusive situation, should absolutely know better than to push someone to reconcile with an abuser- especially when you draw a hard boundary and tell them to drop it.\n\nAnd the mutual friends who are pulling the, \"Oh, she meant well and you should forgive her\" card? Are doing the *exact same thing* the friend was pushing you to do with your mother, just on a smaller scale.\n\n\"But they meant well\" isn't a Get Out Of Jail Free card.\n\nJust because she didn't mean to be cruel doesn't mean she was kind.\n\nThe mutual friends are also trying to give a half-assed apology on your friend's behalf so you'll stop being mad at her, and that shit doesn't fly with me... I'd tell them, \"If (friend) really meant well and feels bad about it, she can come and apologize to me herself- and tell me exactly why what she did was wrong. Until then, I don't want to hear any more about it from any of you... and if y'all can't find anything else to talk to me about, then I don't really want to talk to you lot either.\"\n\nGenerally, I don't accept apologies \"on behalf\" of someone, because that's not how they work. And the best apology is a combination of acknowledgement of wrongdoing *and* changed behavior.... so far, your friend has done neither.",

You never know for whom it might be a traumatic subject.)</p>\n\n<p>Someone like your friend, who has been through her own abusive situation, should absolutely know better than to push someone to reconcile with an abuser- especially when you draw a hard boundary and tell them to drop it.</p>\n\n<p>And the mutual friends who are pulling the, &quot;Oh, she meant well and you should forgive her&quot; card? Are doing the <em>exact same thing</em> the friend was pushing you to do with your mother, just on a smaller scale.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But they meant well&quot; isn&#39;t a Get Out Of Jail Free card.</p>\n\n<p>Just because she didn&#39;t mean to be cruel doesn&#39;t mean she was kind.</p>\n\n<p>The mutual friends are also trying to give a half-assed apology on your friend&#39;s behalf so you&#39;ll stop being mad at her, and that shit doesn&#39;t fly with me... I&#39;d tell them, &quot;If (friend) really meant well and feels bad about it, she can come and apologize to me herself- and tell me exactly why what she did was wrong. Until then, I don&#39;t want to hear any more about it from any of you... and if y&#39;all can&#39;t find anything else to talk to me about, then I don&#39;t really want to talk to you lot either.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Generally, I don&#39;t accept apologies &quot;on behalf&quot; of someone, because that&#39;s not how they work. And the best apology is a combination of acknowledgement of wrongdoing <em>and</em> changed behavior.... so far, your friend has done neither.</p>\n</div>",

I decided to reconcile a year ago, mainly because I felt such guilt for not having a relationship with her because, \u201cshe\u2019s my mom\u201d. I didn\u2019t miss her, I just felt morally obligated to have a relationship with her. Every time I speak with her on the phone (which is a couple of times a month) I am reminded of why I went no contact and it brings up some serious trauma. I often wish I didn\u2019t reconcile with her at all. \n\nI\u2019m still reeling from a conversation we had this morning. When we were getting off the phone she said, \u201cjust remember, I\u2019m the only one who hasn\u2019t left you\u201d. She truly did not see how it was hurtful or why I was upset (it\u2019s also untrue, thankfully I have an amazing support system of friends and family). Statements of that manipulative and cruel nature are commonplace for her, and I typically feel sick after speaking with her. Today, I actually broke out in hives. I think you are wise to not reconcile with them. \n\nMy heart goes out to you and your situation, it\u2019s so incredibly hard to be intentionally estranged from your family. While you no longer have to deal with their toxic and harmful behavior, you still bear the trauma of what made you go no contact. You\u2019re still healing, and it\u2019s SUCH a hard, long process. I hope you are beginning to find some semblance of peace and normalcy. \n\nI\u2019m sure you feel some sort of guilt surrounding all of it, which makes it an extremely touchy topic. It\u2019s a really heavy burden. Your friend was completely out of line for bringing it up so nonchalantly and furthermore, offering advice you didn\u2019t ask for. I understand why you lashed out and wanted to put an end to the conversation. \n\nThat being said, using her abusive situation against her was pretty harsh and borderline cruel. Your statement was warranted and likely made her understand the magnitude of your situation, so NTA, but you could have done it in a way that wasn\u2019t so triggering for her. \n\nI truly hope that you will be able to mend your friendship and become closer as a result. Your individual experiences are a common ground and shouldn\u2019t be weaponized or something that drives you apart.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This post resonates with me so much. I went no contact with my abusive mother for about 6 years. I decided to reconcile a year ago, mainly because I felt such guilt for not having a relationship with her because, \u201cshe\u2019s my mom\u201d. I didn\u2019t miss her, I just felt morally obligated to have a relationship with her. Every time I speak with her on the phone (which is a couple of times a month) I am reminded of why I went no contact and it brings up some serious trauma. I often wish I didn\u2019t reconcile with her at all. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m still reeling from a conversation we had this morning. When we were getting off the phone she said, \u201cjust remember, I\u2019m the only one who hasn\u2019t left you\u201d. She truly did not see how it was hurtful or why I was upset (it\u2019s also untrue, thankfully I have an amazing support system of friends and family). Statements of that manipulative and cruel nature are commonplace for her, and I typically feel sick after speaking with her. Today, I actually broke out in hives. I think you are wise to not reconcile with them. </p>\n\n<p>My heart goes out to you and your situation, it\u2019s so incredibly hard to be intentionally estranged from your family. While you no longer have to deal with their toxic and harmful behavior, you still bear the trauma of what made you go no contact. You\u2019re still healing, and it\u2019s SUCH a hard, long process. I hope you are beginning to find some semblance of peace and normalcy. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sure you feel some sort of guilt surrounding all of it, which makes it an extremely touchy topic. It\u2019s a really heavy burden. Your friend was completely out of line for bringing it up so nonchalantly and furthermore, offering advice you didn\u2019t ask for. I understand why you lashed out and wanted to put an end to the conversation. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, using her abusive situation against her was pretty harsh and borderline cruel. Your statement was warranted and likely made her understand the magnitude of your situation, so NTA, but you could have done it in a way that wasn\u2019t so triggering for her. </p>\n\n<p>I truly hope that you will be able to mend your friendship and become closer as a result. Your individual experiences are a common ground and shouldn\u2019t be weaponized or something that drives you apart.</p>\n</div>",

Every year I seem to collect lost and wayward souls who are often in the LGBTQ+ community and have been abused, abandoned, kicked out, etc. I talk to them, talk *with* them and listen. I send them numbers for assistance and helplines, teach them basic life skills in video chats (boiling eggs, ironing clothes, basic cooking on a shitty budget. And while the food may not be the best it\u2019ll be nutritious and keep you going. \n\nNot sure how it happened but I love all my \u2018kids\u2019 and I\u2019m so proud of them all. I love watching them blossom and thrive and just go from confused and scared to confident and secure. It\u2019s a lot of work but I couldn\u2019t do less. \n\nAt some point after years of abuse and bullshit at home I decided to be the adult *I* needed. And my \u2018kids\u2019 manage to find me. I\u2019ve been doing this for years now and it\u2019s amazing to see them all doing what I did. It\u2019s nice to see them taking up the banner and carrying it forward, helping one kid at a time.",
