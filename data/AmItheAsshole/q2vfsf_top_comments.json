Refuse all offers of \u201cclosure\u201d, and efforts to forgive and forget until you have succeeded in creating a new life.</p>\n\n<p>Hang tough girl.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Just wanted to add my support and say that you did the right thing, so stay strong! IMO your sister's betrayal was even worse than your ex's! No matter how much you want to \"forgive\" her, her selfishness will ALWAYS be between you. So will your parents' complete lack of emotional support. \n\nWhen you finally decide to let these people into your life again, they will all expect you to pretend that none of this ever happened (this is really all they can do tbh), but it's always going to be there in the back of your mind, even yrs later, so you're better off developing a support system other than them. \n\nYour sister doesn't deserve your forgiveness or sympathy for being with your ex! After all, your SISTER is a cheater too. She didn't make a \"mistake.\" She slept with your bf KNOWING that you were in love with him and LIED TO YOU EVERYDAY ABOUT IT. She even fucked your bf in YOUR bed (deep down, she probably WANTED you to find out this way, b/c she's \"in love\" and wanted you 2 broken up already!).\n\nEven worse than this? It sounds like she expected all to be forgiven and forgotten once you knew SHE was in love (and pregnant). This takes a narcissistic level of selfishness and self-absorption. I don't think she was crying on that bench because she cared about your feelings. She was crying because things weren't going the way she expected (she was probably hoping that now the news was out and you'd had your emotional breakdown you could all move on and get down to the business of celebrating her pregnancy).  \n\nAny relationship you could have with her, your ex, and your family would be toxic and unhealthy for you at this point.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Just wanted to add my support and say that you did the right thing, so stay strong! IMO your sister&#39;s betrayal was even worse than your ex&#39;s! No matter how much you want to &quot;forgive&quot; her, her selfishness will ALWAYS be between you. So will your parents&#39; complete lack of emotional support. </p>\n\n<p>When you finally decide to let these people into your life again, they will all expect you to pretend that none of this ever happened (this is really all they can do tbh), but it&#39;s always going to be there in the back of your mind, even yrs later, so you&#39;re better off developing a support system other than them. </p>\n\n<p>Your sister doesn&#39;t deserve your forgiveness or sympathy for being with your ex! After all, your SISTER is a cheater too. She didn&#39;t make a &quot;mistake.&quot; She slept with your bf KNOWING that you were in love with him and LIED TO YOU EVERYDAY ABOUT IT. She even fucked your bf in YOUR bed (deep down, she probably WANTED you to find out this way, b/c she&#39;s &quot;in love&quot; and wanted you 2 broken up already!).</p>\n\n<p>Even worse than this?

My mom just had surgery for her 4th time getting cancer and she doesn\u2019t suddenly believe fucking other people\u2019s boyfriends is okay and definitely not one of her sisters\u2019 boyfriends. Also I think she would be thoroughly insulted if we didn\u2019t designate some time to talk shit about said boyfriend & sister if that\u2019s okay but not too much info because she might show up to fight both of them herself when sister is no longer pregnant. Hope you\u2019re doing good & hope one day your family realize just how wild their actions were during this time.",

It took a lot of time, but I'm so much better off than I was.\n\nIt's going to be a long road ahead before you can truly recover from this. It's time to go out and live your own life and learn to become comfortable for your new-found freedom. On this journey, I believe you will find people who will love you no matter what and will always stick by you. It will be those kind of people who will be your real family. \n\nHere's to a new chapter in your life! May you find your true happiness along the way! Please let us know soon how you are doing. \u2764 And I hope you find someone to celebrate Thanksgiving with!",

Favouritism was core but very different dynamic.\n\nA couple of tips: it\u2019s ok to flip back and forth between feeling deep relief that the estrangement feels like the first certainty you have had with family in decades and freaking out that is forever and that feels massive. A big thing in dysfunctional families is that they know the buttons to press that return us to childhood because they installed them. So often we have moments of such adult clarity and total kid thinking like \u2018forever means permanent oh my god, that\u2019s so scary.\u2019 \n\nThis is normal and it is a part of the grieving for the childhood you did not have. As you adjust the two sides integrate more but it takes time and like any other grief don\u2019t set shoulds and arbitrary timeframes that peer pressure yourself. It will add stress you don\u2019t need.\n\nAlso you are already streets ahead of me knowing when and who to talk to about it. That was a big error I made thinking people would understand. Reader they did not. Including therapists\u2026so pick your tight circle of people who do not abuse the vulnerability you feel being on your own or \u2018but faaaaaamily\u2019 you. \n\nYou will probably find that a lot of the stuff you think will trip you up is easier (like the baby\u2019s birth) while the strangest things catch you unawares and break you. My brother\u2019s wedding I was not invited to that cemented that my family were actually happy I \u2018took myself away and stopped bugging them to behave\u2019 made me mildly irked and wish ugly cast iron on their registry. Going to the wedding of a dear friend (where I actually met my BF of 7 years) where her brother spoke so lovingly of her at the speeches and I saw a truly loving family? Broke down crying at the dinner table. Luckily being 35 and having come alone people assumed I just **really** got emosh at weddings but it was the moment for me I truly deeply finally felt the loss of all of what made estrangement needed. I could have howled at the moon with the depth of hurt at that moment and it was the surprise of when it came that made it stronger. I had girded my loins for holidays etc and it was a one line in joke at a wedding\u2026\n\nAnd the last one, changing your whole life means your whole life will change. You go in a bit \u2018oh I can still speak to grandma\u2019 and like first time parents you have to almost \u2018lie\u2019 to yourself that you can pick and choose what changes in order to do it. But the change will change and you will not control it. It will be awful at times and amazing at others. You will change and some people you love will not like the changed you as much. My best friend ghosted me about a year into my estrangement because I had changed and it brought up stuff for him about his family dynamic but also he liked me more when I was more of a doormat. It hurt like hell but 5 years on I am glad we aren\u2019t friends anymore. He did the right thing the wrong way but if we\u2019d continued I couldn\u2019t have resolved my grief and trauma. \n\nI have spent a lot of time working out which memories or tokens of people I want to keep. Emotional Marie Kondo-ing. It will take lots of steps to get to a point where you can miss someone, enjoy a memory and be relieved you never need go back. It varies person to person and there is no rush.\n\nEstranging even if you ever go back, changes your outlook on them forever and you have your whole life to process it and meet yourself. It\u2019s wonderful and terrifying.\n\nPlease DM if you would like a list of books that are helpful reading or want to swap a few tips on coping strategies. My first Mother\u2019s Day? Ordered pizza in bed and browsed the staggering number of Joan Crawford Etsy cards and did no \u2018journalling\u2019 or therapist suggested healthy behaviours but ate pizza and felt better learning how many other people have families who hurt them. A LOT of advice on estrangement is almost emotionless but I like bringing some humanity into it as if you don\u2019t laugh as well as cry you end up doing stupid stuff like dating someone who re-enacts the dynamic. I also like to imagine pithy or petty things I would do to them and then never do it but let my imagination be a place I use as an outlet. Maybe a Google search for yellow cast iron as a late wedding gift but otherwise I have never responded to them in any way for 8 years.\n\nGood luck!",

My best friend ghosted me about a year into my estrangement because I had changed and it brought up stuff for him about his family dynamic but also he liked me more when I was more of a doormat. It hurt like hell but 5 years on I am glad we aren\u2019t friends anymore. He did the right thing the wrong way but if we\u2019d continued I couldn\u2019t have resolved my grief and trauma. </p>\n\n<p>I have spent a lot of time working out which memories or tokens of people I want to keep. Emotional Marie Kondo-ing. It will take lots of steps to get to a point where you can miss someone, enjoy a memory and be relieved you never need go back. It varies person to person and there is no rush.</p>\n\n<p>Estranging even if you ever go back, changes your outlook on them forever and you have your whole life to process it and meet yourself. It\u2019s wonderful and terrifying.</p>\n\n<p>Please DM if you would like a list of books that are helpful reading or want to swap a few tips on coping strategies. My first Mother\u2019s Day? Ordered pizza in bed and browsed the staggering number of Joan Crawford Etsy cards and did no \u2018journalling\u2019 or therapist suggested healthy behaviours but ate pizza and felt better learning how many other people have families who hurt them. A LOT of advice on estrangement is almost emotionless but I like bringing some humanity into it as if you don\u2019t laugh as well as cry you end up doing stupid stuff like dating someone who re-enacts the dynamic. I also like to imagine pithy or petty things I would do to them and then never do it but let my imagination be a place I use as an outlet. Maybe a Google search for yellow cast iron as a late wedding gift but otherwise I have never responded to them in any way for 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n</div>",
