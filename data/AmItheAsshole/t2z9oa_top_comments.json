They obviously can\u2019t do right by their own children. My kids wouldn\u2019t dare even think of this because they know I would let them sit in jail! Lana has issues-the words/phrases \u201cstalker\u201d, \u201cpsychological issues\u201d, \u201cpoor judgment\u201d, inability to control her temper\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d come to mind. Yes, I said \u201cdangerous\u201d. Not all abusers are men. If anything, your son has been mentally abused and manipulated by this young woman. Yes, they will be buying your son a car-it\u2019s called a CIVIL suit. Lana definitely needs therapy and that can be part of a court ordered CRIMINAL punishment. Also, your son should get a restraining order. Sue for the damages, and make her parents pay up for the car, but ALSO let the courts handle the criminal matter and continue with pressing charges. Lana needs to learn there are actions to her consequences. You can ask the prosecutor and/or Judge to have Lana enter court ordered counseling as part of her punishment. I wouldn\u2019t trust her parents to do it on their own.</p>\n</div>",

We called the cops but they didn\u2019t want our CCTV footage and basically said they\u2019d try to ride by and catch \u2018people\u2019 in the act. \nMind you- we tried to wait out the harassment. It continued for nearly 2 years. The last time it happened- I confronted the \u2018people\u2019 via FB Messenger and told the \u2018people\u2019 that they better make sure that they tell all their friends if it ever happens again I would be pursuing legal action with a vengeance. I\u2019m still angry about the fact that \u2018people\u2019 got away with this despite the fact that it has stopped, we hope. It hasn\u2019t happened for a year but I still feel on edge that it could begin again any time \u2018people\u2019 get bored because clearly they think this activity is funny. Or whatever they think, at the very least they think it\u2019s acceptable. \nI really feel like we tried to take the higher road and I guess it\u2019s done but- after all this time I really wish that we had pursued legal action much more diligently and I wish that there had been consequences. It feels unfinished, to me. \nAlthough no real damage was done, I have to say it was pretty scarring. The \u2018what if\u2019 still plays in my head. What if \u2018people\u2019 find my kid\u2019s car in a parking lot somewhere and feel like they won\u2019t be caught. What if the new love interest gets told a different story than what it was and finds my kid alone somewhere. If there had been legal consequences, I feel like at least I would have a reasonable expectation that my kid, my property, my kid\u2019s car would not continue to be at risk ever again. And the worst \u2018what if\u2019? What if this happens to someone else who isn\u2019t as capable of handling the turmoil. The sleeplessness. The harassment. The fear that it might be escalated. \nIf it was just a once or twice thing and it didn\u2019t continue for as long as it did. If \u2018people\u2019 hadn\u2019t involved up to six other individuals. Then maybe I\u2019d feel different today. \nI applaud your decision. \nI agree with your actions.\nI am actually incredibly happy that you declined the parents offer to make good on behalf of their daughter. You can\u2019t just let parents buy solutions for their kids when they do terrible stuff. That\u2019s ridiculous. \nIt may feel like a big thing to her parents now, and it should, but they\u2019ll pay to get it expunged or whatever later and that will be that anyway. Just like it never happened. Meanwhile - I highly doubt that she\u2019ll ever be your problem again. So good for you, dammit. I\u2019m quite proud of you for being good parents and good citizens. People that go to all that trouble to be terrible humans are likely to repeat those behaviors and I hope you caused her to think twice about doing anything of the kind ever again. \nThis was almost cathartic! \ud83d\ude02 Thank you for posting!",
