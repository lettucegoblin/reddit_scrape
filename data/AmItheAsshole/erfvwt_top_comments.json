The dress was \\*your\\* property, you paid for it solo, and you're entitled to do whatever you want with it. You could've donated it or sold it on ebay to recoup some money, it's none of her business. You didn't owe her a dress. Would your sister listen if you explained your reasoning? I'm assuming there is/was at least some closeness there before for her to ask you about the dress. Tell her you didn't realise she was serious and ask if she'd have done the same if positions were switched. Could you write to her if she won't listen - if she still refuses, then don't feel bad, you're not in the wrong here anyway. \n\nIf you want to soothe things you could offer some alternatives - shop with her for second hand/only worn once dresses if she'd consider that. Another alternative is - and this is entirely up to you either making a dress for her yourself, or getting another one and altering it to make it look how she wants. It depends on if she's ameable to mending fences really, it's not all on you, she has to behave like a rational adult and if she can't, well, that's on her\n\nWhat would she had done if you didn't have a wedding dress to hand? She can't just expect people to give her free/cheap things and can't be totally opposed to a second hand dress if she wanted yours! Did she say why she wanted your dress - was it simply about convenience and cost or was it style etc. If you can, explain to her why you did it, and ask why she wanted the dress. Another issue for her getting so arsey with you could also be embarrassment on her part. If she doesn't have any money for whatever reason, so might find this humiliating that she can't afford a 'good' dress - I'm not exusing her behaviour, but it could be a reason. Also perhaps it's the instrgam culture and she has to have the picture perfect wedding and the dress is central to that we are conditioned that weddings should cost tens of thousands, be picture perfect and if it's not, we're somehow a 'loser' so part of her behaviour \\*might\\* mask embarrassment - she thought she was going to get a beautiful, expensive looking dress that people could admire and that's gone and her dress will now have to be more in line with her actual budget, is she someone who appearance is everything? Maybe she told people about this amazing dress and now she doesn't have it? again, no excuse to fall out with you though. \n\nI'm also really sorry about your heart being broken and being cheated on.

I've learned from the very few posts that I've had on here that most of these people are dicks. I even deleted my posts bc people were being so mean. I know it's hard to not take it personal but try not to, they are just bored, miserable people that want to make other people miserable.

I can't even imagine the pain of losing a child.  \n\nI would like to explain my perspective, if you're willing to hear it.  \n\nLosing my siblings has been a part of my life that has affected me deeply.  I was 6 when my sister was stillborn, and 7 for my brother.  \n\nMy parents dealt with their grief as well as they could - my mother developed postpartum depression, which devastated her for years, and my father threw himself into his work.  They both basically disappeared from their children's lives for a long time, leaving us to the care of a nanny who was bullying and aloof.  \n\nNo-one explained anything to me, or even talked about what was going on.  I had to wade my way through my own grief without any guidance, and without telling anyone about my pain, because I didn't want to become a further burden on my already-suffering parents.  \n\nI began having constant, recurring nightmares about dead children, sometimes I would be trapped in a fire, choking on the cremated ashes of my little brother.  \n\nMy brother who died had a twin who survived, and I would sit beside him for hours in the middle of the night, just to make sure he was still breathing, because I was terrified that he would die like our other siblings if I wasn't there.  \n\nThe idea of seeing our lost brother or sister laid out in ceremonial dress just horrified me on some deep, visceral level.  Seeing that as a child would have just destroyed me, and I can't even say why.  \n\nMaybe because it would seem like trying to cover up the true horror of the death of a child, by making it \"pretty\"?  \n\nI hope that I have explained things well enough, again, I meant no insensitivity to the pain of a parent, and I'm sorry for that.  I was reacting with the pain of a child experiencing loss.",
