There is not doubt that she and your BIL had EXTENSIVE conversations about you being there and how you could fuck things up. 6 months is something to be proud of, but in the real world that is not enough time for your family members to trust you 100%. \n\nYour BIL was most likely acting on behalf of your sister to make sure her special day didn't have a \"situation\" they had to deal with.

Its his wedding, not yours, and im sure he just wants it to go off without issue. But its not about his mistakes, its about yours. If you wanna stay sober i suggest taking a look at the incident from the perspective of \"how did i fuck up here\" and maybe you truly didnt, but id expect some amends are in order for causing a scene. I get it tho man ive been clean and sober for 4 and a half years now and my parents still keep their belongings in a safe despite them living in FL and me in TX. My mother still calls me every once in a while on a wild hair because shes worried i might use. But thats all because of my own actions. The AITA game is a dangerous game to play for a person in recovery because whatever outsiders may say theres almost always a little bit of YTA, and thats the shit that we gotta deal with. Talk to your sponsor, or whoever your support group is and take the necessary steps to clean your side up at least.

        "body": "Late to the party, but I hope you read this:\nI\u2019ve got an older half sister and half brother who are both alcoholics and the brother is a crack addict. When we merge as a family he will willingly tell us he\u2019s 24 hours sober for the event. And I applaud him for that. My half sister has never admitted to the addiction to alcohol, though it has been seen and well documented. \n\nThey have shown such abandon to the family due to the addictions. They have made our father openly cry. They have ruined blessed events in their own lives and in the lives of all my family members. They have inappropriately acted in private and public towards all of my family. \n\nFor the rest of my life I will accept them as my family, but I will not allow them into my life. If I get married, they will not be there. There were at our brothers wedding, and it went fine. I wouldn\u2019t risk it. I refuse to allow them into my life, and I have my reasons and they are my own and will not change. I love them as much as I can, but I draw a line at involving them in my life. \n\nYour sister still had you at her wedding. I wouldn\u2019t, in her shoes. And if my addict siblings showed up at my wedding, I would be beyond suspicions that they were somehow inebriated before arriving. I wouldn\u2019t allow them in, now would I accept them with the rest of family. \n\nYou are lucky that you have a sister and BIL who think enough of you to have you in their lives. Because I wouldn\u2019t. You are lucky that they know who you are, who you were, and sadly but honestly who you will likely be again. Truthfully, if you don\u2019t relapse, you are better than most. And those statistics are more honest than a recovering addict. \n\nI hope, more than words can say, that you go from recovering to recovered. I hope you stay clean. I hope your family loves you and allows you into their lives. I hope you can be there, straight, to see nieces and nephews. I hope you can see birthdays and anniversaries without any issue. \n\nBut dude, these wounds take time. And someone being pragmatic, even if he went too far in your eyes, isn\u2019t something to be mad about. Your BIL did what he felt was right for his life, which now includes the life of your sister. It wasn\u2019t the nicest thing, but think about it: have you been guilty of doing not the nicest thing? And do you deserve forgiveness and another chance?\n\nYou do. And so does he. And again, I hope you both lucky enough to get that chance. Because I will not give that chance any more to my siblings. They\u2019ve lost all credibility, chances, benefits-of-the-doubt, etc. with me. And they can\u2019t earn it back. \n\nYou still might be able to. \n\nYou are the asshole. \n\nAccept it. Apologize for it. Move on from it. Let this be the moment you realize that you don\u2019t just get let back in but have to earn it. And spend your life earning it so that you become the beacon of hope for others who appear hopeless. You deserved that treatment from your BIL, and now you can show him that such treatment will never have to happen again.  Show him that the moment meant something to you. Show him that you grew into a better person because of it. \n\nIf you don\u2019t; if you harbor anger and hatred towards him; if you bring it up to shame him in the future; if you use it as an excuse to be a shitty person in the future; if you can\u2019t forgive someone for a transgression while simultaneously asking for forgiveness for your own transgressions - then you\u2019ve prove that he was right in his actions. \n\nBest of luck in your recovery. Be better than who you were yesterday, every day.",

When we merge as a family he will willingly tell us he\u2019s 24 hours sober for the event. And I applaud him for that. My half sister has never admitted to the addiction to alcohol, though it has been seen and well documented. </p>\n\n<p>They have shown such abandon to the family due to the addictions. They have made our father openly cry. They have ruined blessed events in their own lives and in the lives of all my family members. They have inappropriately acted in private and public towards all of my family. </p>\n\n<p>For the rest of my life I will accept them as my family, but I will not allow them into my life. If I get married, they will not be there. There were at our brothers wedding, and it went fine. I wouldn\u2019t risk it. I refuse to allow them into my life, and I have my reasons and they are my own and will not change. I love them as much as I can, but I draw a line at involving them in my life. </p>\n\n<p>Your sister still had you at her wedding. I wouldn\u2019t, in her shoes. And if my addict siblings showed up at my wedding, I would be beyond suspicions that they were somehow inebriated before arriving. I wouldn\u2019t allow them in, now would I accept them with the rest of family. </p>\n\n<p>You are lucky that you have a sister and BIL who think enough of you to have you in their lives. Because I wouldn\u2019t. You are lucky that they know who you are, who you were, and sadly but honestly who you will likely be again. Truthfully, if you don\u2019t relapse, you are better than most. And those statistics are more honest than a recovering addict. </p>\n\n<p>I hope, more than words can say, that you go from recovering to recovered. I hope you stay clean. I hope your family loves you and allows you into their lives. I hope you can be there, straight, to see nieces and nephews. I hope you can see birthdays and anniversaries without any issue. </p>\n\n<p>But dude, these wounds take time. And someone being pragmatic, even if he went too far in your eyes, isn\u2019t something to be mad about. Your BIL did what he felt was right for his life, which now includes the life of your sister. It wasn\u2019t the nicest thing, but think about it: have you been guilty of doing not the nicest thing? And do you deserve forgiveness and another chance?</p>\n\n<p>You do. And so does he. And again, I hope you both lucky enough to get that chance. Because I will not give that chance any more to my siblings. They\u2019ve lost all credibility, chances, benefits-of-the-doubt, etc. with me. And they can\u2019t earn it back. </p>\n\n<p>You still might be able to. </p>\n\n<p>You are the asshole. </p>\n\n<p>Accept it. Apologize for it. Move on from it. Let this be the moment you realize that you don\u2019t just get let back in but have to earn it. And spend your life earning it so that you become the beacon of hope for others who appear hopeless. You deserved that treatment from your BIL, and now you can show him that such treatment will never have to happen again.  Show him that the moment meant something to you. Show him that you grew into a better person because of it. </p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t; if you harbor anger and hatred towards him; if you bring it up to shame him in the future; if you use it as an excuse to be a shitty person in the future; if you can\u2019t forgive someone for a transgression while simultaneously asking for forgiveness for your own transgressions - then you\u2019ve prove that he was right in his actions. </p>\n\n<p>Best of luck in your recovery. Be better than who you were yesterday, every day.</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019m glad to hear you are getting clean but while you\u2019ve known when you can and can\u2019t trust yourself, the ones you love haven\u2019t had that luxury. As much as I\u2019m sure you are clean now (and congratulations on that), I feel like it\u2019s happened before that you\u2019ve lied about being clean in the past.\n\nWeddings involving immediate family are a big deal for anyone. You\u2019re seeing family members you don\u2019t always see. I could totally see that being a trigger or a stressor. He doesn\u2019t know how you\u2019ve coped with that type of thing before. Or maybe he has heard past excuses for relapses and such, idk. I can\u2019t imagine the conversation about you being invited to the wedding was an easy one for them.\n\nWhat he did wasn\u2019t necessarily right. You didn\u2019t necessarily deserve it.

They probably should have told you if he planned on doing this but I\u2019m thinking he did this without talking to your sister about it?\n\nBeing a recovering addict doesn\u2019t make you a terrible person. It just means that you\u2019ve had to start at or below ground zero on earning people\u2019s trust. That sucks, but you made an ass of yourself and humiliated yourself when you were using. At least this type of humiliation is going towards building something worthwhile. It\u2019s not fair to expect people to just suddenly trust you 100%. That\u2019s going to take years of hard work and staying clean, not to mention some embarrassing encounters.\n\nRather than being frustrated about it, I\u2019d consider these things additional milestones. \u201cThis person didn\u2019t think I was capable of attending my sisters wedding without a fix.

We don\u2019t know how bad your addiction was other than needing to be bailed out. We don\u2019t know your history with the couple.

        "body": "YTA, just your whole attitude says it all. Congratulations on trying to keep clean, I really mean that. But let's be real... 6 months is not that long, and for a former junkie, a wedding? Come on, that's asking for a relapse. I'm betting they were expecting a relapse because you've done it before, Christmas, Thanksgiving maybe? I'm guessing (based on personal experience) that you've been clean before, or said you were, and a family event happens, you're invited. Everything is good for a bit, then you dissapear for a while (for some bullshit reason) all of the sudden, you're fucked up, Mom's crying, and everyone's like here we go again. You see, in my experience, when dealing with an addict, they fuck up or stain every family event for years because of their selfishness. Now your Sister is getting married, it's her day, HER DAY. Her future husband has seen you fuck up things for years, he wants to protect her, so you get a pat down, too bad, deal with it, act like a big boy. You were big enough to make your own choices and you chose drugs, be big enough to accept the consequences... But No, you acted like the selfish person you have shown yourself to be, by causing a scene and yelling at your sisters wedding, at the fucking Groome. My brother has been a heroin addict for ten years, fucked up 3 siblings weddings and countless family events, all when he had significant time clean, or so we thought. The good news for you is people love a redemption story, so get yourself right, stop thinking about yourself only and show people you're different. Good Luck.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA, just your whole attitude says it all. Congratulations on trying to keep clean, I really mean that. But let&#39;s be real... 6 months is not that long, and for a former junkie, a wedding? Come on, that&#39;s asking for a relapse. I&#39;m betting they were expecting a relapse because you&#39;ve done it before, Christmas, Thanksgiving maybe? I&#39;m guessing (based on personal experience) that you&#39;ve been clean before, or said you were, and a family event happens, you&#39;re invited. Everything is good for a bit, then you dissapear for a while (for some bullshit reason) all of the sudden, you&#39;re fucked up, Mom&#39;s crying, and everyone&#39;s like here we go again. You see, in my experience, when dealing with an addict, they fuck up or stain every family event for years because of their selfishness. Now your Sister is getting married, it&#39;s her day, HER DAY. Her future husband has seen you fuck up things for years, he wants to protect her, so you get a pat down, too bad, deal with it, act like a big boy. You were big enough to make your own choices and you chose drugs, be big enough to accept the consequences... But No, you acted like the selfish person you have shown yourself to be, by causing a scene and yelling at your sisters wedding, at the fucking Groome. My brother has been a heroin addict for ten years, fucked up 3 siblings weddings and countless family events, all when he had significant time clean, or so we thought. The good news for you is people love a redemption story, so get yourself right, stop thinking about yourself only and show people you&#39;re different. Good Luck.</p>\n</div>",

You omitted all sorts of necessary info in an effort to try to look like the innocent party. I\u2019ve seen performances like this from addicts in my life, and every single time - EVERY SINGLE TIME - they were not accepting accountability. \n\nIf you\u2019re a friend of Bill (or whatever the drug equivalent of that is), you\u2019re failing steps 4 & 10. If you\u2019re in a different sort of addiction program, you still should know that this sort of behavior is red flag city, and whoever is supporting you should know that you\u2019re having trouble controlling your behaviors and accepting consequences of your years of addiction and what you did during that time. \n\nYeah, your BIL could\u2019ve handled it better. But there\u2019s so much dissembling and trickle-truthing and self-justifying that it\u2019s hard for me to know if your explanation of the situation is 80% true, 50% true, 20% true, or 2% true. I don\u2019t even know you, but your post set off my addict lie detector (which I sure as shit wish I hadn\u2019t had to develop). \n\nDon\u2019t let this derail you. Double down on the things that have helped you stay clean for 6 months (and again, I\u2019d like to say again that 6 months is excellent, and you should be proud of that). Talk with your sponsor and/or your peers, and acknowledge that you\u2019re having trouble with the truth. This is common in recovering addicts - the addiction is such that lies become increasingly common, and many addicts get more adept at telling them. So talk to sponsor & peers, and get guidance on reestablishing a healthy relationship with the truth. \n\nThe whole situation is an unfortunate mess, and I certainly wish your BIL had approached this differently. That having been said, part of accepting accountability is acknowledging that people are going to treat you differently because of your behaviors while addicted. Apologize to both of them. Keep on the right path. Keep doing the things that are working. \n\nBut don\u2019t let yourself get derailed because someone treats you in a way you don\u2019t like, because of your history. That\u2019s a tough thing to avoid, so you need strategies to handle it. Sponsor & peers can help you. \n\nGood luck, and for for your sake & the sake of your family, I hope you stay clean and go on to build a good life. I hope one day you & BIL can be genuine friends, and that this will be part of an unfortunate past but will have no more effect on the future.",

Just say \u201cyou know what, I get it....here, if you need to check my bag, or pockets or whatever, just do it.\u201d It will be a surprise to them and it will quicken the healing process between you and whoever is acting suspicious/mistrustful.  </p>\n\n<p>It sucks to feel like you were singled out, but you weren\u2019t targeted because he hates you, you were picked because you have a specific history and he didn\u2019t want you to be high on your sisters wedding day.</p>\n</div>",

You glossed over a lot of background - that maybe doesn't justify the public nature of this - but could mitigate his actions. My cousin was an addict and relasped a ton. Especially within a year of being clean. She came to all the family events because we loved her and wanted to support her - but she was shady. Brought drugs. Was high. Had dealers meet her in the parking lot. And the very worst - Stole everything. Literally everything she could get her hands on she stole. Jewelry, heirlooms, money, coupons, etc.  Act tough? I guarantee you your invitation was an absolute drama filled discussion beforehand. I disagree with his public nature, but if you are like most addicts I know you put  your sister and family thru hell.

You glossed over a lot of background - that maybe doesn&#39;t justify the public nature of this - but could mitigate his actions. My cousin was an addict and relasped a ton. Especially within a year of being clean. She came to all the family events because we loved her and wanted to support her - but she was shady. Brought drugs. Was high. Had dealers meet her in the parking lot. And the very worst - Stole everything. Literally everything she could get her hands on she stole. Jewelry, heirlooms, money, coupons, etc.  Act tough? I guarantee you your invitation was an absolute drama filled discussion beforehand. I disagree with his public nature, but if you are like most addicts I know you put  your sister and family thru hell. Like, I wish we patted my cousin down because she stole so many important things I  am getting upset even thinking about it.</p>\n</div>",

But I don&#39;t think you were in the right to begin with so that makes it even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Also unfortunately the internets opinion of what happened is completely irrelevant as are friends and family. The only 2 people whose opinion matters are your sister and your BIL. Your BIL certainly isn&#39;t happy about your reaction, and your sister is either neutral, or also not happy. I&#39;m struggling to find a scenario in this world where your reaction was the right one.. I think the person you hurt most with your reaction is yourself and your sister, not your BIL.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s my 2c.</p>\n</div>",

I say this as the spouse of someone with a recovering addict brother, and myself having a recovering addict brother and a dead by overdose sister (one year ago today). The whole situation sucks, but the one atoning for sins can't be offended without drawing suspicion. It says a lot that the nobody in the family came to the defense, just kept the peace preventing the occasion from becoming a shit show. These are people who know the situation far better than we do on reddit only hearing one side of the story. Op, if you want to earn back the trust of the family, it's going to be a long road. Getting upset that you're not trusted after six months does not go towards earning back that trust. Sure, six months feels like an eternity of sobriety, but to the family members wronged, it's ***only*** six months. Brother in law didn't handle it the right way, but as someone who's had to hear their sibling barely made it through another overdose while deployed to Iraq, I've seen too much of this. Ok, that's enough of my soap box.\n\nOn a sad note, I miss my big sister like nothing else; on a good note, my brother and my wife's brother are both doing great. Part of why they're doing great is they've been sober for YEARS  now and have gone through the arduous process of earning back trust while being understanding of the damage they caused. \n\nOp, you deserve an apology from brother in law (eventually), but you probably have a lot more apologizing to do yourself. The long six month road you've been on feels like a short 180 days for the rest of the family. Remember, you're going to be super oversensitive, especially to criticism and questions about addiction. Unless they've been through it themselves, they can't fully grasp how out of your hands addiction has been for you, how little control you actually had. This road isn't easy, but I can say you can eventually regain an amount of trust you will be happy with. If you rush the process, while you may not be the asshole every time, you're just going to frustrate and upset the (family) recovery process. Be patient. This is the emotional capital you lost while you were actively addicted. I'm sorry you're going through that, and I wish you the best. Hang in there, even if you slip up, you family obviously loves you, and are sticking around for the long haul. Most of all, at least you aren't in a tiny urn around your siblings neck like my sisters ashes are. I was the last to hear from her.",

I don't know a single opiate addict who hasn't done something stupid/rude/selfish/disrespectful. Opiates quickly erode your moral compass and ability to think rationally. \n\nIf one person is on heroin, everyone they know and love are basically on heroin too. What I mean is that opiate addicts bring the same drama, chaos, and pain into the lives of everyone around them, and for those who don't do drugs, they just can't understand it. They can't cope with or comprehend how a person they knew so well and loved so much can become a selfish, sick, hollow shell of who they once were. They look at the pale, thin person who just got caught stealing their checkbook (again) and have a hard time believing that it's their sibling or child who used to be so compassionate, funny, and warm.\nThere isn't really such a thing as an opiate addict is only hurting themselves. \n\nWas the brother in law a dick? Probably. However, it's one of those times where he did the wrong thing but it's also totally understandable and forgivable. What opiate addicts put their loved ones through makes those loved ones jaded and untrusting toward the addict. Most likely the brother in law was thinking \"well, there's a chance that he brought dope to this wedding and if he's using then my wedding is gonna end up being all about him, one way or another. He'll make sure of that.\"\n\n\nOP, this isn't to bash you. As I mentioned I'm also in recovery. But you're gonna have to give people more time. They need to see clean time and genuine change before they can make themselves vulnerable to you again. And if you're serious about making amends then suck it up and accept a little bit of scepticism on their part. Shrug your shoulders for a year or so and just say, \"Yeah, that's probably fair.\"",

They look at the pale, thin person who just got caught stealing their checkbook (again) and have a hard time believing that it&#39;s their sibling or child who used to be so compassionate, funny, and warm.\nThere isn&#39;t really such a thing as an opiate addict is only hurting themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Was the brother in law a dick? Probably. However, it&#39;s one of those times where he did the wrong thing but it&#39;s also totally understandable and forgivable. What opiate addicts put their loved ones through makes those loved ones jaded and untrusting toward the addict. Most likely the brother in law was thinking &quot;well, there&#39;s a chance that he brought dope to this wedding and if he&#39;s using then my wedding is gonna end up being all about him, one way or another. He&#39;ll make sure of that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>OP, this isn&#39;t to bash you. As I mentioned I&#39;m also in recovery. But you&#39;re gonna have to give people more time. They need to see clean time and genuine change before they can make themselves vulnerable to you again. And if you&#39;re serious about making amends then suck it up and accept a little bit of scepticism on their part. Shrug your shoulders for a year or so and just say, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s probably fair.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

When someone hurts you that badly, for that long, I can say with experience, olive branches start to come with conditions.  Dealing with an addict isn't just, \"Oh well, I guess so-and-so is using again.\"  It's years of heartbreak, constant stress, and often financial damage - all for the sake of someone who sees you only as someone to manipulate for personal gain.  I'd say BIL was justified in wanting to search OP, though he was out of line to do it without notice.  For most of the time he's known OP, OP has been a liar and the source of what might have been the worst pain the love of his life has ever had to go through.  We also *now* know, thanks to OP's addition of some relevant information, that OP also constituted a physical threat to BIL at points in the time they knew each other.  Neither are those things a person just forgets nor are they things that can't start again.  \n \n\nRegardless of OP's intentions, BIL was well within his rights to make sure that OP wouldn't ruin their special day, based on the greater body of knowledge he had about OP.  He shouldn't have sprung a search of any kind of OP like that, but OP was wrong in how he handled it.  That OP, rather than leaving or requesting a private search, chose to get high and mighty and tried to continue into the wedding space, showed that he was either ignoring or didn't understand the magnitude of harm he did to BIL.  \n\nIf you harm someone like that for that long, you have to accept that you give up certain dignities with them, and that's fair.   OP seems serious about living a productive life, and his family should help him along that way and praise him where applicable, he doesn't get to expect that everyone will just treat him like a trustworthy member of the family.
