He was/is an alcoholic (and in retrospect, a very sad, broken and angry man).\n\nAnyway, our mother treated us as accessories. She also used us as a shield placed between her and my father. She chose to divorce him, and as a result my brothers and I all have severe mental health issues that manifested throughout our lives. \n\nI used to beg her not to have to go visit my father. She\u2019d say either \u2018you have to - he\u2019ll get angry at me,\u2019 or \u2018sure, call him and tell him why you don\u2019t want to see him.\u2019 I used to sit beneath the phone, 9 years old, staring at it trying to will the courage to call and say I didn\u2019t want to see him. It wasn\u2019t because I thought he\u2019d get mad, it was because I didn\u2019t want to hurt him.\n\nMy mother feared him, so she sent us off to appease him. Can you imagine making a choice to not be with someone you feared, but telling your children they would have to see/deal with him?\n\nI believe in the original post, the girls were said to have come home and gone straight to their rooms for an hour after a visit... my brother and I would return home nearly mute and low functioning. I can\u2019t really describe how oppressive, nauseating, frightening and world shattering the visits were.\n\nBoth parents would denigrate the other to us. Both parents would claim I was exactly like the other in moments of poor behaviour and conflict. \n\nAs a child and adolescent, I had behavioural issues - and many of my friends were also from divorced homes. Every one of my divorced friends fell off the success path before 25 (most due to drug addiction). In college very few friends were from divorced families, and once I found myself in a high-functioning profession, there were no divorced friends left anywhere: just me.\n\nDivorce can ruin children - and it will haunt them for the rest of their lives. But it doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nI would (with all my biases) describe the mother in OP\u2019s situation as an evil narcissist. She chose another man even if it meant destroying the stability and development of her three children. It disgusts me.\n\nOp, if you read this, you\u2019re a good father, but your kids need protection from their mother. When they ask for it (and the request may be subtle or cryptic) protect them. Supervised visits, good. But if they decide they don\u2019t want to visit anymore, bear the burden of that negotiation - don\u2019t make them parse that with their mother themselves (y\u2019know, unless they\u2019re 18 or something). And also, never denigrate their mother in front of them. You\u2019re a great father, but yelling at their mom in front of them is a giant mistake. It hurts your children in ways you might not understand (or maybe you do). \n\nAnd when she saw her children behind you, crying due to your conflict, her reaction was to smirk... plus cheating, plus denigrating you, plus choosing another man over her children, and putting the idea of abuse in their heads.... evil narcissist.",

Lots of young ladies would have less shame and embarrassment about their cycles if they\u2019d had a dad explain and do what you did. Hearing it from a mom is prob best, but hearing it from a dad achieves the same outcome AND instills in them that men ARE aware and knowledgeable about these matters and that nothing is wrong with it. It also solidified your daughters trust in you and that she can come to you to talk about embarrassing things and while you may not know every single thing, you\u2019ll do your best to help her. Telling her the truth about the cheating at this age is the right thing. You kept your mouth shut until SHE came to you about it. You didn\u2019t badmouth mom her whole life like so many parents do. You let her come to her own conclusions and then just answered truthfully. That\u2019s exactly what you should have done. You\u2019re doing a good job. I hope you know that.

Once we were sunk almost saddlehorn deep and I couldn't pull my legs out of the suck to enlighten my dear mare, I had to leave it to her to save us both. I will never forget how I felt her thinking and pulling all her parts together under me to risk a \"suck and jump\" to the next spot, inches forward, and how she did it several times until she felt an edge of ground under her feet, stretched herself like a cat and saved us both. Then we both stood on solid ground until we stopped shaking enough to move forward, and she refused to take a step until I remounted. Getting us home was HER job. No leading, no wandering. \n\nOnce we got home and I removed the tack, I saw the mud line, about three inches from her withers on both sides.\n\nMy advice is to back wayyyyy up and use every option to fight back. If for no other reason, in memory of a mare named Gypsy. \n\nI bet your daughters totally understand why you yelled. Back up, take a deep breath and go mama grizzly plus fighting for reality in my dear Gypsy's memory. Keep shedding the FOG and getting more sensible and rational and enraged at the right things as needed. Your gut is your best guide. Tell us what your gut says.

I grew up constantly wishing they would get back together, but I realize now that it was more a matter of longing for family stability and emotional security.

It was hard to be caught in the middle of my dad and mom\u2019s fights, and he didn\u2019t have the same emotional tools to deal with the situation as you seem to have.\n\nSo, thank you for being a great dad to your girls.

If I talk to my dad, she will always find out what I said, because she\u2019ll act sweet just long enough for him to feel like he can talk as parent to parent, before realizing his mistake when he hears her yelling at me a few minutes later (if she doesn\u2019t try to hide it from him first, so I look crazy when I tell him).

My mom did some shitty stuff, and was never around when I needed her, the first time I got my period I cried in the bathroom like a toddler, so embarrassed I would have to ask my dad to buy me pads because I had it instilled in my head from a young age that men should never ever know about women and their reproductive organs unless they are your boyfriend/husband (not by my parents, but by society, my dad worked a ton and when he was home he would spend as much time as he could making up for being at work, while my mom was just a lazy drug addicted mooch)\n\nYou did the right thing, you handled the situation perfectly and you helped your daughter understand that it's okay to talk to you about what's going on with her body, my dad did the same with me and if it wasn't for him I'd probably still be in the same mindset of shaming myself for a man knowing I was on my period. You made her comfortable, you acknowledge her feelings, and you gave her someone to speak to when she truly needed it and for that you will be rewarded with her trust, whilst she will feel more open to talking to you about things that are bothering her. My dad made a lot of smart steps as a single father of a daughter, I didn't have to have much of a rebellious stage as he treated me like an equal when I needed to be treated like one, instead of a clueless child. You're an amazing man, not just for being a dad, but for stepping up when your child needed you, for treating her like she was equal and letting her know her emotions were valid, for giving her an open, non judgmental space to explain what she was going through. You and your daughters are going to do just fine, it's hard when they're young, I know it was for me too, I never wanted to accept that it was over, we weren't the same \"happy\" family anymore, and my mom would spew toxicity over my dad any chance she got, but I grew up, I realized who was at fault, I made my decisions and I cut my mother out of my life.

She waited until I was older to tell me that he cheated on her (which he still denies) because she wanted me to have the best relationship I could with him through my childhood. However, sometimes even little kids can work out that their parent is abusive and toxic - I ended up developing severe anxiety about going to see him and stopped overnights when I was 8. \n\nI recently met up with him for the first time in a year of cutting off contact, and I must say I can look back at my childhood and say I never enjoyed being around him - just like what your 12 year old is saying now. \n\nI strongly suggest offering therapy for your daughter if you can, these types of things are often good to talk about with a person outside of the situation. Therapy has helped me realise how awful my dad was and how much my mum has helped me, which has meant that me and my mum have a really special bond and I love being around her still. \n\nGood luck in the future, you sound like a great dad and your girls are lucky to have you \ud83d\udc95",

However, sometimes even little kids can work out that their parent is abusive and toxic - I ended up developing severe anxiety about going to see him and stopped overnights when I was 8. </p>\n\n<p>I recently met up with him for the first time in a year of cutting off contact, and I must say I can look back at my childhood and say I never enjoyed being around him - just like what your 12 year old is saying now. </p>\n\n<p>I strongly suggest offering therapy for your daughter if you can, these types of things are often good to talk about with a person outside of the situation. Therapy has helped me realise how awful my dad was and how much my mum has helped me, which has meant that me and my mum have a really special bond and I love being around her still. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck in the future, you sound like a great dad and your girls are lucky to have you \ud83d\udc95</p>\n</div>",

It sounds like OP is fully aware of the weight on his daughter\u2019s shoulders that the concept grew into and the tone of this post makes me feel like he is probably going to work on making sure he takes that weight off of her as well as making sure it never grows to that point again.",

When he started instilling that in her I can\u2019t imagine he ever anticipated that she would have to look out for them with their own mother. I agree that it should have been a focus for all of them to have been taught to try and look out for their siblings (or anyone that they love really) 100%. It sounds like OP is fully aware of the weight on his daughter\u2019s shoulders that the concept grew into and the tone of this post makes me feel like he is probably going to work on making sure he takes that weight off of her as well as making sure it never grows to that point again.</p>\n</div>",

That was fine when we were kids/teenagers and a 7 year age gap meant something but as adults you have to mature emotionally beyond childhood roles. Unfortunately she can't and it's one of the reasons I'm low contact with her. Can't be dealing with that shit in my 30's!",
