He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. \n\nWe always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. \n\nWe were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. \n\nWe decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. \n\nTurns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. \n\nI\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset.

There was no further commitment at the time. What your ex did may have been hurtful, but he did what he did to heal and the one that supported him was your sister as wrong as that sounds. He never cheated on you or broke a promise in that action, regardless it&#39;s understandable how that hurts, yet what you did was a breach in trust as you went through his phone without his permission, and you&#39;ve even admitted he cut it off when going back with you, again never breaking his commitment to you in this manner. In your pain crashing their wedding is an extremely inappropriate and childish response, basically saying &quot;if I can&#39;t be happy they can&#39;t either.&quot; That&#39;s an asshole move regardless of how hurt you are. However, some of the words exchanged by other people were also asshole things to say, but what you did was so wrong that I can&#39;t give an e t a as the specific question is regarding your reaction and they were assholes in response to what you did, not prior. These n t a redditors can&#39;t seem to understand real life, this is exactly what the top meta post in this sub is talking about.</p>\n</div>",

Glad you&#39;re going NC and really sorry they&#39;re such garbage people. And your parents are ok with it all?! I can&#39;t wrap my head around the total lack of basic empathy and social norms. </p>\n\n<p>Hope therapy helps you recover from what must have been a crappy childhood.

It&#39;s going to take a long, long time, but eventually it&#39;ll just be an occasional dull background ache that pops up when something reminds you of them. Grieving changes you - you will be a different person at the end. But you will be a person who can move forward in life without such vile people.</p>\n\n<p>The child you lost is a terrible tragedy and can never be anything else, but it&#39;s likely that the relationships you lost are better being lost. You&#39;re young and have a lot of time to grieve, to heal, to move forward and build a new and better life for yourself. Learning the harsh, painful lessons of who these people are at 45 would ultimately be a much worse outcome for you and your life.</p>\n\n<p>I know that&#39;s little comfort now. I know that you still have the same difficult process ahead of you and that things might feel bleak. I urge you to continue with therapy, develop new friendships, and find a path forward in life. Things can and will get better, it&#39;s just going to take time.</p>\n</div>",

I guess she must have always been insanely jealous of your relationship with him to actually marry your sloppy seconds. I feel for you OP and I\u2019m sorry you have such a craptastic family. Here is wishing you such a happy future and a new love and beautiful family. I will also pick a few awards for you because damn you deserve them.  Sell the freaking ring and take a vacation. I wouldn\u2019t waste a dime on therapy over any of that or any one of them. Celebrate the universe for revealing the people they truly were and you have a doozy of a story to tell.\n\nEdit:  thank you all for the awards. I am glad so many agree that OP deserves the best future and to leave this mess and these crazy people in the dust!",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Holy cow. What your sister said about why your baby died is the most insensitive selfish delusional narcissistic shit I have heard in a while. Burn the ship and do not look back. I guess she must have always been insanely jealous of your relationship with him to actually marry your sloppy seconds. I feel for you OP and I\u2019m sorry you have such a craptastic family. Here is wishing you such a happy future and a new love and beautiful family. I will also pick a few awards for you because damn you deserve them.  Sell the freaking ring and take a vacation. I wouldn\u2019t waste a dime on therapy over any of that or any one of them. Celebrate the universe for revealing the people they truly were and you have a doozy of a story to tell.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  thank you all for the awards.

Click in there and you can block either by person, or by date.   I don't know how thorough it is, so if someone tagged in your memory reshares it I think you'll see it again.\n\nAnother helpful low contact family trick: set up a custom group for anyone that you're LC with, and then set your default post sharing to friends except the LC group.   Combine that with an unfollow or three and you're low contact on Facebook without the drama of unfriending them.",
