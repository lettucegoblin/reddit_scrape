If it would mean a lot to you to have your sister give you away, then she should be the one to do that and your fianc\u00e9 should be supportive and understand that connection. \n\nAlso, traditionally speaking it makes literally no sense for your father-in-law-to-be walk you down the aisle. He can\u2019t metaphorically give you away given that\u2019s he\u2019s the grooms dad and not yours. Traditionally the role is performed by the father of the bride because of past family roles but it\u2019s core is someone who raised the bride and was a guardian to her.

Its not just his wedding, it's your wedding. TRADITIONALLY, it's the brides wedding entirely. Men pretty much stay out of it. If they want to play the \"traditional\" card, they can back TF down.   \n\n\nI'm so sorry, but this might not be the right long term relationship for you. I know that you love him, but this says so much about him and his values. Does he think that he's buying you as an object who will have no will and no say about your life? Does he think that he gets to define what is right and wrong with no input from you? Does his family support this abusive idea that your input doesn't count?  \n\n\nAs a kiddo who went through as much as you went through, you are vulnerable. Abusive men love that because its easier to isolate you. I don't know if this guy is working this angle, but it sure sounds like his family is.   \n\n\nIt's absolutely outrageous to think that your father in law would walk you down the aisle.  I guess it would be cool if he was involved in your childhood somehow, like being a friend of the family, but NO, FILs do not walk brides down the aisle and \"EW!\" at the idea that this is traditional.

If your SO doesn\u2019t understand that, then I\u2019d very strongly suggest you two to see a counsellor BEFORE you marry. </p>\n\n<p>Make sure that you and him on the same side about a bunch of things like finances, parental care and leave should you have kids, expectations from said kids if they\u2019re girls and boys (eg if they\u2019re so traditional, are they going to expect girls to be super pink frilly dress wearing little girlie-girls or will it be okay if a girl is a tomboy and refuses anything that isn\u2019t trousers?) It sounds silly, but I feel a lot of the times \u201ctraditional\u201d is a label to hide \u201cmisogynistic and fixed in gender roles and expectations\u201d.</p>\n</div>",
