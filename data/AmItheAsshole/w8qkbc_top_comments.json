When I tell you that this profoundly affected my life,  it affected me in so many ways I could write a 32 chapter BOOK about it... everything from my feelings on sex, self-worth, relationships, and so on.... it was ALL affected by the fact that I felt like I was never good enough for my father's love. \n\nTurns out, it wasn't even about me. My dad had the issues (He was a Vietnam Vet who  was on the front lines as a platoon leader - PTSD ruled his behaviors for many years) but that didn't make it any easier or less painful for me.   I ended up divorced twice, addicted to heroin, and completely and utterly emotionally damaged. \n\nYour post brought me right back to how I felt in 1987 - no matter how hard I worked, no matter how many things I did right,  my dad was ALWAYS on my shit about some perceived transgression.

I don't dwell on emotions and I don't let things get to me...and even with all the mental toughness in the world, I was so desperately damaged.\n\nPlease - your husband needs to explore this. He has some unresolved issues that are creating a need for complete control and obedience that is unattainable.  There is a cycle at work here that needs to be ended. \n\nI NEVER get on Reddit and spout away with the armchair psychology.  If you read my history, I definitely lean on the \"suck it up, Buttercup - life is hard, deal with it\" side.  I am not one to spout off like this arbitrarily.  I had an absolute visceral reaction to your post due to the familiarity of my experience.  It is never too late to fix these things. \n\nI am now 51 and my dad is 75. He has worked hard to overcome and manage his PTSD. I have gone through years of counseling and periods of no-contact to deal with the scars of the past.

He has never called her names, made her feel unworthy, or hurt her heart in any way. My dad did the best he could with the tools he had at the time - which unfortunately, were very few when I was young. By the time my daughter was born 27 years ago, he was in a different place. \n\nSeeing his love and respect for me through his relationship with my child was the thing that finally healed my heart..  You don't want to wait that long for your child. I promise you, something much deeper is at play here. \n\nGood luck to you\n\nAnd obviously NTA",

You did the right thing. You stuck up for your daughter. I understand the concern when it comes to abuse.

It is not anyones place to hypothesize what you should do with your marriage. We clearly don\u2019t know everything about the situation here, but what I think people aren\u2019t thinking about is that, in most situations, mistreatment isn\u2019t solidified for just one person.

Again, not my place to insert my opinion, but my recommendation if you are trying to \u2018save\u2019 your family, would be family therapy, and possibly consider talking to your daughter about her mental health, and asking her if she needs support. These little steps could truly make all the difference, I know it would have for me. Please proceed with caution, as these type of things are extremely difficult to navigate.",

I grew up with a father that had radicalized views espoused on the internet. I know what it is like to be a teenage girl in this scenario. I was actually a lot like how you have described your daughter; a homebody that just wanted to stay home and read, and was overall a responsible teenager. \n\nI don\u2019t speak to my father anymore. I have not spoken to him since I moved out about 8 years ago. My father is a monster. There was the dismissive bullying to start with. That kids had it so easy, millennials were ruining everything, we don\u2019t know how to work, we are all too liberal. All the conservative rhetoric that makes even conservatives look bad. I was bullied and mocked constantly for anything I enjoyed that my father deemed stupid. I was told to stop making friends and having fun because school wasn\u2019t for friends it was only for learning (which is categorically untrue, social skills learned in highschool are important for your future adult relationships, and I was also a straight A student), I was even told I didn\u2019t have rights as a minor extending even to bodily autonomy. My father would mock break outs that I had and would grab my face to rub his fingers across my acne, and if I dared to jerk away I was told that I wasn\u2019t allowed to because it was disrespectful and as my father he could touch me if he wanted to. I was mocked for my body, while also being constantly objectified, and developed an eating disorder, and still struggle to have a healthy body image and with being comfortable in clothing that I was told made me a slut and a whore (just basic things like tank tops and shorts). I was told I lived in a benevolent dictatorship. If he wanted my opinion he would tell me what it was. I was told that women are raped because we are emotionally manipulative and psychologically cruel to men and when a man is cruelly rejected by women too many times he snaps out of desperation. I was told women also exaggerate how often we are sexually harassed and assaulted and frequently lie about it because we regret one night stands etc. that was some of the more damaging viewpoints he attempted to indoctrinate his teenage daughters with. My father had no respect for women in general, and even less for his children. We were taught about how LGBTQIA+ identities are mental illnesses and should be treated in what was basically conversion therapy. And that any representation of those identities was liberal indoctrination. \n\nWhat starts off as just a couple viewpoints that are a \u2018little\u2019 toxic and a \u2018tad\u2019 extreme becomes an entire identity based in anger and hatred. It is poison to children. Every single one of my fathers children struggles with mental health issues, depression, CPTSD, self harm, and even suicidal ideation. It caused untold damage to my psyche because I knew my father did not respect me simply as a human being, but beyond that, he caused active harm as a means to exert control. \n\nEventually this radicalization became so complete that my father had an entirely delusional world view. He literally saw his daily reality vastly different than everyone around him. He was abusive. He was emotionally and psychologically abusive, and while he never directly hit us, he put so many holes in the walls in anger and broke so many things \u2018because of us\u2019 that we were constantly terrified he would. And when he was confronted about his abuse he said he wasn\u2019t abusive, we, his children the oldest of which was MAYBE 14, were actually abusing him, because we would forget to do our chores sometimes. Which just further contributed to his intricate web that he designed to gaslight us into submission. \n\nKeeping your daughter around him is dangerous. He WILL damage her mental health in the long run. I will never fully recover from the damage my father did to me. Your daughter knows how her father feels, she is old enough to know how he is treating her, she knows enough about what is happening to be DEEPLY impacted by it.\n\nProtect your daughter. Get your daughter away from him. If you want to then go to marriage counseling with him to work on his issues, and possibly reunite your family if he accepts his faults and works to change them, by all means do so. It sounds like this is new enough behavior that it may still be reversible. But do not force your daughter back around him until SHE is comfortable with the progress he has made. Abusers can and do go to therapy to \u2018win\u2019 and can successfully manipulate you into believing he was right or that he has changed and he hasn\u2019t. If you want to give your marriage a chance that is a totally valid choice to make, but your priority needs to be protecting your daughter. Get her as far away from him as possible, and do not make her go back until she feels safe and ready.",

It makes you view yourself as a warped an awful thing that doesn\u2019t deserve goodness in life. </p>\n\n<p>Ask your husband straight out if he loves his daughter. If he scoffs and says \u201cof course I do,\u201d ask him how he is showing it and how that type of \u201clove\u201d would work on him. If he\u2019s horrified and says \u201cof course i do! How could you think otherwise?!\u201d then tell him he needs to find a way to show it that isn\u2019t harmful.</p>\n\n<p>Any other answer\u2026leave.</p>\n</div>",

I'd be concerned that your husband has been brainwashed, perhaps inadvertently, into thinking your daughter is no good because her entire generation is no good, because he's been told so repeatedly and has come to believe it.\n\nSo much of recent modern thinking is driven by media (social media, alt media and main stream media) creating 'in-groups' and 'out-groups' and swaying people's thoughts to identify as part of one in-group and dislike/disparage the out-groups.\n\nThat might mean raging against 'the gays', 'carnivores and planet-killers', 'the hispanics', 'the boomers', or 'gen z', but it's really cleverly done to cause dopamine hits and entrench opinion so that people continue to consume the same media (with a side of voting for a particular party, or not voting at all).\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not aware of any good deprogramming techniques, other than some research which has shown that having people watch the TV of 'the other side' (Fox vs CNN IIRC) for a month or 2 brings people back to the centre and lets them see others from different walks of life as people rather than dehumanised objects to fight against.\n\nGood luck, however you need to handle this, you're a good parent.",

        "body": "My dad went down this path in 2020. He had become brainwashed and was no longer the man who raised me. My mother divorced him and he completely broke down.\n\nIt was only at his lowest point that he was able to understand what he had allowed himself to become. He did a lot of introspection that I helped him with. We watched some documentaries and I had him read some books on brainwashing, the corruption of religion as a social engineering tool, Fox News, as well as books about diverse experiences of life. He really changed again. He converted and became Buddhist and is a happier and more educated person. \n\nBrainwashing can actually change the structure of your brain by enhancing the pathways that are beneficial to the ideology used to gain support. Love, fear, disgust, and rage are usually the emotions driving the ideology. Right wing media uses mostly rage and fear to manipulate, and repeated exposure to constant new information using this manipulation tactic activates the same pathways in the brain over and over. This makes those pathways larger and creates a loop of endorphins and dopamine when a worldview-affirming information activates that pathway. Since so much of the information is rage/fear based (the two emotions are very similar) the brain associates being mad and/or scared with these boosts of endorphins and dopamine. People become addicted to being mad at or afraid of some enemy. People\u2019s enlarged neural lobes cause them to become progressively angrier, dissatisfied, and paranoid people over time. These changes affect people\u2019s personalities. These pathways and emotional feedback loops have to be broken down in order to return the brain to \u201cnormal\u201d. \n\nAnyway,\n\nMy parents remarried after my mom realized that I DIY de-programmed him and it wasn\u2019t an act. \n\nI offer this story, OP, to say that you shouldn\u2019t assume that he is a lost cause. He needs to be broken down emotionally to the point where he is able to accept the fact that he has been wrong about everything, especially the way he has been treating your daughter. Feeling wrong causes actual pain, so that\u2019s why he is unlikely to be able to listen to you until the pain of feeling wrong is less than the pain of his current life. Divorce. Don\u2019t make it ugly. Have him spend time with people that he trusts who will offer to help explain to him why he is in the situation. Have information about right wing cults at the ready. Make him go to therapy if he wants to see you again. Many conservative people have trauma that they lack the skills to cope with in a healthy way. He needs help.\n\nYour daughter needs the most help though. You should prioritize her recovery from trauma. She needs therapy too. Your husband may grow to resent her more after divorce and his mind may not be recoverable. You need to help her though. Her father has been programmed to loathe young people by right wing media. To get to this point there would already be a lack of quality time spent with your daughter, so there is something wrong regardless. However, if he is able to be deprogrammed with your daughters health as top priority, it think this would be the best option. A reformed asshole dad is better than no dad.\n\nGood luck",

I just thought all these alt-right, ultra conservatives had found a voice with a certain political leader which had allowed them to freely display all the prejudices they had kept buried for so many years. \n\nI have a friend, actually  an ex high school BF, who contacted me after some 35 years of not seeing one another.  He had always been a really sweet guy with a very sunny disposition and got along with everyone in my family.  Unfortunately,  I came to realize my sunny, sweet friend had undergone a 360 personality change. He was very argumentative, pushy, and aggressive. He told me he had joined this religious group of around 500 members,  no name and they believed that come Judgment  Day that only those who were members of their religion would be spared, everyone else would go to hell. I laughed thinking he was joking but apparently was not. He was quite aggressive in insisting I join; I did not.  On top of that, he had become a very conservative alt right who worshipped the orange one and watched Fox News incessantly...everything else was *fake news*.\n\nI tried to talk to him, reason with him but he had drunk triple portions of the Kool-aid.  I said Let's just talk about the other zillion topics and not discuss religion nor politics.  He agreed. Then almost immediately started sending me videos of these alt rights trying to convince one of a bevy of mistruths. Some of it was so offensive,  I couldn't believe he could believe that crap. Oh, and he firmly believed the world was 2,000  years old, no dinosaurs, no fossils could convince him otherwise ...all fake. I received endless religious stuff but it managed to cross over to offensive as well because it was just more Alt right bull dressed up in a religious format. I begged him to stop sending me that crap and he would promise not to but 3 days later..there was another one. It was always Just watch this with an open mind, what this guy/woman says is really true!! More offensive crap. Finally after pleading, threatening I had to go NC. He still tried sending me stuff but I'd delete without looking (why ruin my day?) And I didn't reply. I'm tempted to send him what you wrote but I believe he is in it way too deep. The political convictions, the religious beliefs are so extreme and now make up so much of his identity that I don\u2019t see him ever coming out of it. But now I don't know....is it possible for someone that entwined with the alt-right to come out and it and turn him back into my old friend??",
