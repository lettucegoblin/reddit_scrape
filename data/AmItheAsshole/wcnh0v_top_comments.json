I mean yes that&#39;s understandable -- she&#39;s nine and still learning the skills around regulating emotions.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly does your wife want to &quot;punish&quot; your son for?  The thing that you both -- his parents -- not only gave him permission to do but provided him with money to bring things back for his sister?  If this is a correct reading of the situation the cruelty your wife is wishing on her son is *really* shocking.  If I were him I would think my family doesn&#39;t love me anymore because I went to Disneyworld.  That&#39;s effed, my friend.</p>\n</div>",

My parents didn't keep me from taking the role, instead they celebrated with me separately and took some time to sit with my sister and her feelings and explain what tons of strangers here have told you, that sometimes older kids get to do stuff first because they're older, but my sister would have lots of opportunities to do things I never did because I had aged out of it.\n\nSure enough, because I was a senior in high school at the time and she was just a freshman, I moved on to college and she had a multi-year career with that community theater, both on stage and off working on sets and scenery. She would never have had the opportunity to do a ton of amazing shows if my parents had kept me from being in that production because it upset her.\n\nLife will certainly even things out. Especially considering that these kids are in elementary school, this is a great time to teach a lesson.

Just keep an eye out for opportunities that your daughter has that your son never did, and allow her to enjoy them if she chooses to partake. Do not exclude your son from opportunities and things that the whole family gets to enjoy, or he will feel excluded and it really won't be fair.",

I was definitely upset at the time because it felt very unfair.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that isn&#39;t wasn&#39;t very fair to me, but it would have been more unfair to my sister if she hadn&#39;t been allowed to go. It was just one of those things and this post triggered the memory for me, it&#39;s not something I dwel on. I&#39;m sure my sister would have been very bitter for a long time if she was the only one in her class not allowed to go.</p>\n</div>",

Some you may not even see coming; my brother got to visit Ireland in grade 11, go to prom, tour his university, make friends on campus, etc. I had been looking forward to doing the same for years, but then COVID happened and trips shut down. I was excited for prom and it was cancelled for the same reason. I never got to tour my university, or even be on campus at all. Our lives turned out differently and there was nothing my mother could've done to make up for it. It's just something you learn to live with.\n\nAll this to say, NTA.

This is totally normal, and mom should be helping her daughter manage her disappointment and understand, rather than enabling her daughter's tantrum & punishing her son (talk about being unfair!!!) over being invited to something fun for him. And who's to say that the daughter won't be asked to go to Europe with a friend when she's 13, or on a ski trip, or to Hawaii? I'd be willing to bet that mom isn't going to suggest she stay home just because her older brother won't get to go. \n\nOP, NTA. Tell your wife that your daughter will have chances to go places with friends when she's older, and that you promise to not suggest even once that your daughter not go because her older brother will be missing out. Or that your daughter should be left out of a FAMILY vacation because of it. \n\nIf your wife just doesn't get it, I'd suggest some couples counseling to discuss it in a safe place with a professional. Because she's being not only unreasonable to an extreme extent here, but it's turning into being cruel to your son, and that's a huge problem. It sounds like this isn't just about the Disney trip, and a good marriage counselor may be able to help you navigate to the bottom of it and work through the real issue(s).",

Growing up, my 20 year old cousin would get the same gift as the 10 year old on Christmas. We all have matching pajamas, purses, etc regardless of our personality. \n\nFor clarity: the oldest is my husbands bio son from a previous marriage, and our youngest is my bio son from my previous marriage. \n\nMy husband took our teen on a road trip earlier this year when the youngest was with his bio dad. I planned a trip to the beach with the youngest after his summer with his dad ended\n\nMy husband decided to do a second road trip with the oldest before school starts. I feel like a dumbass now, but I was frustrated that the teen got 2 trips while the little got one. He literally had to explain to me that they weren\u2019t comparable and helped me break down why what my family did was odd. \n\nOP is NTA. OP\u2019s wife has a broken normal meter. What makes her an AH here isn\u2019t the misunderstanding of how the world works. She\u2019s icing our her husband instead of having a conversation with him like an adult. She\u2019s not allowing him to understand her POV and she\u2019s not open to understanding his. That\u2019s not how conflict works in a marriage.\n\nEdit: thanks for all of the awards. I did not expect anyone to care about my nestled comment.  I tried to catch responses, but it got hard to keep up. I\u2019m sorry if I missed you.",

We all have matching pajamas, purses, etc regardless of our personality. </p>\n\n<p>For clarity: the oldest is my husbands bio son from a previous marriage, and our youngest is my bio son from my previous marriage. </p>\n\n<p>My husband took our teen on a road trip earlier this year when the youngest was with his bio dad. I planned a trip to the beach with the youngest after his summer with his dad ended</p>\n\n<p>My husband decided to do a second road trip with the oldest before school starts. I feel like a dumbass now, but I was frustrated that the teen got 2 trips while the little got one. He literally had to explain to me that they weren\u2019t comparable and helped me break down why what my family did was odd. </p>\n\n<p>OP is NTA. OP\u2019s wife has a broken normal meter. What makes her an AH here isn\u2019t the misunderstanding of how the world works. She\u2019s icing our her husband instead of having a conversation with him like an adult. She\u2019s not allowing him to understand her POV and she\u2019s not open to understanding his. That\u2019s not how conflict works in a marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thanks for all of the awards. I did not expect anyone to care about my nestled comment.  I tried to catch responses, but it got hard to keep up. I\u2019m sorry if I missed you.</p>\n</div>",

It would prepare her in the future where not everything is fair. For the daughter to immediately burst into tears as soon as she saw her brother with souvenirs, sounds like the mother painted the son badly towards the daughter, as if the she was purposely excluded from the trip.\n\nThe fact that the mother would purposely exclude her own son from a family trip to \"even then score\" is...

OP I doubt you&#39;ll answer but in the 1 percent chance you do, how did your wife treat your son and daughter BEFORE the trip? Because it sounds like she may have potentially held him back from stuff simply because sis wasn&#39;t allowed herself.</p>\n</div>",

I remember I once started to hit my head on the wall so she would stop crying and start laughing so I wouldn't get punished because she hurt herself while we were playing. It worked too. \n\nWe were both good in school, but she is more outgoing and extroverted while I enjoy being by myself and reading books. We also never got in trouble and while we were growing up we were actually treated fairly equally. But somehow I always got blamed if something was wrong and it was very unfair that later she never had bedtime and curfew while at her age I did. \n\nOf course she's the one with the right middle school and a college degree and no (diagnosed) mental problems. She is also the one that still lives at home, is driving mom crazy and is working a job unrelated to her degree that has three shifts and pays only slightly better than my one shift.

I remember I once started to hit my head on the wall so she would stop crying and start laughing so I wouldn&#39;t get punished because she hurt herself while we were playing. It worked too. </p>\n\n<p>We were both good in school, but she is more outgoing and extroverted while I enjoy being by myself and reading books. We also never got in trouble and while we were growing up we were actually treated fairly equally. But somehow I always got blamed if something was wrong and it was very unfair that later she never had bedtime and curfew while at her age I did. </p>\n\n<p>Of course she&#39;s the one with the right middle school and a college degree and no (diagnosed) mental problems. She is also the one that still lives at home, is driving mom crazy and is working a job unrelated to her degree that has three shifts and pays only slightly better than my one shift.
