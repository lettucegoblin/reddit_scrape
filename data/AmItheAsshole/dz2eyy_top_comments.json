A lot of people have said \"how can you survive in 2019 without a cell\" which although to us as the younger generations dont understand, my grandmother uses a landline for every non face to face conversation she has and loves the nostalgia of a cuppa and a phone call on a rainy day. That said, shes an avid Walker and takes my dads old 3310 on her walks and I'm pretty certain she hasn't added credit in the past 2 years because its explicitly for emergencies. That's where your parents are in the wrong.\n\nIf we take this to a daily event scenario, 15 minutes late without an update is fine. However, if one of them were injured for any reason in the crash, then they wouldnt have shown up at all and wouldve genuinely ruined your day for not attending with no contact.\n\n**However**\n\nYou *really* suck. They're your damn parents and they showed up to your wedding day regardless of their excuse for being late. That's considerably more than what most people get on their wedding day and you should grow up and have some appreciation for the ones that love you so much that they're only 15 minutes late to your wedding, despite getting rear-ended, talking to the police, and swapping insurance info. You even said they left early, dont twist the truth and say that they didnt do enough when you know damn well they did.\n\nSummary - It must really suck to not have your parents present when you said your I do's. But life happens. They still were present on your wedding day and they still got to see you and your husband have the time of your lives at the reception (assuming you had one). Dont tarnish that memory with something negative. You have every right to be upset, but you also have to be reasonable and recognise that they did their best to get there early and had some shit luck but still got to the venue.\n\nI hope you dont fall out with your parents over something childish, and I hope your parents join the modern age and get a bloody mobile phone, even if they just keep it charged and in the glove box for when they leave the house. Doesnt matter if you're a technophobe, there are more dangers outside the house now then there was before mobiles existed. They're useful for a reason.",
