What I was trying to convey here is that in this particular situation, I don\u2019t think that the punishment fits the crime. My food allergy allegory wasn\u2019t meant to downplay her dietary concerns, it was meant as a way to somewhat relate to the situation. Luckily for myself, the one time I had my food legitimately tampered with (spiked with an allergen because they thought that my allergies would just give me the shits), I wound up just using an epi pen and being all right. In that situation, I didn\u2019t press charges. I had a rational conversation with the person about why what they did was stupid as fuck, had them pay for my new epi pen, cut them out of my life, and left it at that.\n\nHad I been legitimately damaged by that incident, I likely would have felt very differently about the situation. At the end of the day, I wasn\u2019t- much like OP in this situation.\n\nRestaurants tampering with food IS and SHOULD BE a crime. People tampering with food (adding an ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be there) is also a crime. But the punishment should fit the crime- which I don\u2019t really believe fit here. This was a group of wasted friends who in incredibly poor taste fed their friend something that they knew wouldn\u2019t ultimately damage her, even if it was an awful thing hurt her psychologically. I don\u2019t think that the possible punishment from a police report being filed fits that, hence my ESH ruling.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a stranger (chef or otherwise) deliberately tampering food with intent to harm. This is a group of \u201cfriends\u201d trying to pull a really, really, REALLY fucked up and morally wrong prank.\n\nIf the maximum possible punishment for this was, say, a fine, then absolutely not the asshole.

I know how fucked up it is if someone fucks with my food on the grounds of not believing me or not caring because it has caused me issues in the past. \n\nThe thing is, your dietary concern is a preference. It\u2019s really shitty your \u201cfriends\u201d violated your trust like that, but outside of maybe a rough shit the next morning it didn\u2019t cause you any harm. Food tampering charges are a *felony* in quite a few states. That seems like a massive overreaction to what at the end of the day was just a prank in very, very poor taste.\n\nThese friends deserve to be cut out of your life. What they did is absolutely inexcusable. But as someone who has also had issues with tampered food in the past that actually caused health problems, possibly subjecting someone to a felony for something that at the end of the day was meant to be a joke (no matter how shitty of a joke it was), is a pretty big overreaction.",

Did they think it was really a harmless prank? Why did they think this was going to be funny? Why would they do this to you? Do they show remorse or just... do they show any capability of understanding that it was wrong? Did they apologise? \n\nMeh, I feel bad for you.

It&#39;s so disrespectful and evil and wrong in ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL aspects. I&#39;d never trust them and literally walk the fuck away.  But I&#39;d first confront them and fucking make sure they know they are shitty humans for doing this, I&#39;d probably break them down lol I&#39;m sorry but this would infuriate me, and I&#39;d feel so betrayed that I wouldn&#39;t be able to control myself.</p>\n\n<p>However, I wouldn&#39;t go the police. I think that&#39;s taking it a bit too far. I don&#39;t know much about &#39;food tampering&#39;, but wikipedia tells me that the food is altered in a way that can be harmful to you. Although you haven&#39;t had meat in forever, eating the nuggets is not really putting you in danger. If it was something you were allergic to, this would be a whole other story of course. </p>\n\n<p>Your friends say you are overreacting. Have they come with an explanation at least? Did they think it was really a harmless prank? Why did they think this was going to be funny? Why would they do this to you? Do they show remorse or just... do they show any capability of understanding that it was wrong? Did they apologise? </p>\n\n<p>Meh, I feel bad for you. I wouldn&#39;t go as far as going to the police, but my friends would really not get away with this easily. I&#39;d take care of the situation myself tho, I would turn into the hulk in this situation lol</p>\n</div>",

When the roulette Doritos came out, I was munching away, and my husband reached over and grabbed a chip thinking I was eating regular spicy doritos since the bag color was the same. \n\nOh, the poor dear. He did not get a regular nacho. He did not win roulette. Had to pour him a glass of milk to stop him from dying. \n\nHis best friend runs a food blog, and we went over to help him with a video opening and trying a Japan box. I brought over a pack of Samyang spicy noodles (the ones everyone was doing as a challenge). I eat them on the regular, and while I think they are spicy, they're not THAT bad. They taste amazing. However, his best friend has a sensitivity to spicy foods. He likes it, but his tongue will get all torn up from the acidity. BUT he knew what I was bringing, and he agreed to the challenge. I made the noodles while we tried stuff in the box, and at the end it came time to try it. My husband tried one bite and noped out and drank some of my sake (which he hates) in order to calm his mouth. I sit there chowing down as usual. His best friend starts eating it, and he likes the flavor- but his damn tongue was on the verge of BLEEDING. Like it looked like his tongue was attacked by a cat. \n\nNow when something we try says \"spicy\" in a box, I try it first and give the okay if it isn't actually spicy or it is more of a sweet heat. \n\nOn a side note, those chocolates are disgusting. But I also don't like chocolate. I've had a ghost pepper gummy before and it was just....weird. Spicy and cherry is just an odd combination. \n\nAlso, I don't know if they sell it elsewhere, but pepper jelly is really good. The tiniest bit of spice, but since most people serve it on top of cream cheese, it's pretty much cancelled out. You should try it. It may just be a Louisiana thing, though, because I had never heard of it before moving here. We just eat it on crackers. It is DEFINITELY way more sweet than it is 'spicy'. I would say it has the same level of sweetness vs. Spice as like....oh! The purple doritos. The sweet spicy chili I think is what they are called.",
