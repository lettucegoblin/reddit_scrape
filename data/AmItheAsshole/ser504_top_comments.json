But unless everyone else is planning on dressing for the circus, she might want to keep the plushies in her craft closet for now.  It's fully reasonable for you to assure her that her dress idea is fun, creative, and ENTIRELY inappropriate.\n\nBut beyond how bafflingly  attention-demanding such a garment would be, there's one potentially even bigger issue: I guarantee there will be family and friends in attendance who DO NOT GET THE JOKE, at which point your gf would just be wearing a wedding dress that implies the wedding couple are a couple of nasty sewer rats whose marriage is worthy of ridicule.\n\nI assure you, even if not everyone, SOMEONE will be extremely uncomfortable in a comically avoidable way. Likely several people.It is well within your rights to refuse to bring her along (You didn't say \"our\" friend) If she refuses to dress in a way that you're certain the groom and groom will be comfortable with.

So using the meme at all is going to fall completely flat.\n\nIn context, it's about a gay marriage on the kids show \"Arthur\", in which a male rat character (all the characters are animals) gets married to... I guess another male rat? I don't remember if Mr. Ratburn's husband was a different species or what.  Anyway, this caused real-world controversy amongst conservatives, with some places, like in Alabama, refusing to air the episode.  \n\nSo \"I support gay rat marriage\" was a reference to supporting this show for kids having the marriage within the show, as a feature of an episode, and opposing the conservative freak-out over it.  (And in particular, it's about supporting the idea of showing LGBTQ+ characters and themes in kids shows, to help normalize the idea for kids and to support kids as they grow up and perhaps begin to explore queer identities themselves.)\n\nWithout knowing that context, though, people are left to interpret what the hell this meme is supposed to mean.  Most people at that wedding won't know the background, or get it. Especially not like 2 years after that incident, but moreso because it's unlikely most of them are part of the communities in which that meme originally spread.\n\nIf the grooms had been super active spreading that meme at the time, if they were fond of the show \"Arthur\" and happy about that episode / character development, it MIGHT be different.  Her wearing such a dress might be a happy reminder to them of something they like.\n\nThe key point is -- it's not.  The grooms don't sound like they care about all of that.  OP says they don't like the \"creative\" way the gf dresses anyway.  \n\nOP's gf sounds like one of those people who has never really learned a bunch of basic social lessons.  The first being: not every event is about you showing off your fabulous creativity; sometimes the focus belongs on someone else, and you are upstaging them, not adding to their fun.  The second being: it's actually kind of rude to bring in in-jokes that come from a community that nobody else there really belongs to.  It sounds like she has never learned about judging context, and why lack of context can cause things to fall flat, or be misinterpreted. \n\nLike, yeah, fine, within her online social group, there are likely still positive memories of this gay-marriage-supporting meme.  Outside that community, though, it has no meaning.  She's making the common nerd mistake of thinking that what has meaning within the community will be correctly interpreted outside the community, or, that it doesn't matter if people outside the community can't interpret your meaning, you want to express it anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear, I think that's fine if you're talking about, like, riding public transportation in cosplay, or a nerd-themed t-shirt, or like this, a dress made out of nerd-themed fabric.  Go for it!  Let your freak flag fly.  I've been there.\n\nBut that is extremely NOT APPROPRIATE for someone else's wedding, where you aren't tight with them.  Even if you WERE tight with the grooms, they might say \"we'd prefer you not wear that, because our families won't know what it's about, and we don't want them confused or to have to keep explaining\".  (Here, it kind of sounds like the grooms haven't yet been given a heads up that she wants to do this.)\n\nAgain, it's about NOT taking attention away from the grooms.  You do NOT want your weird dress to be what people remember about this wedding.\n\nOP, you are NTA.\n\nIf you can't get through to her that it's inappropriate for her to be drawing attention to herself at someone else's wedding, I'd go so far as to warn the grooms about it.  And if they decide to un-invite her, that would be their right.\n\n(Future AITA: \"I was uninvited to my bf's friend's gay wedding, just because I wanted to wear a dress that showed my support for gay marriage!
