Clearly,  him putting you in last place behind his friends and watching sport, isn't something that his family was aware of. Your husband is incredibly selfish. How horrible of you to have the nerve to go into labor and give birth, while there was a game on ! How rude of you to inconvenience him with the expectation of him taking you to the hospital, supporting you through labor and being present  for your child's birth. Don't you know by now that you and your needs arent as important, as him being with his friends and watching sports ? I wouldn't have let him near my room at the hospital - he couldn't be bothered to be there for you -  in any way, shape or form - he didn't deserve to meet his child until you went home. And I most certainly wouldn't have gone straight home - i would have gone and stayed with family for a bit. This actually would be a 'last straw' for me - I'm sorry, but intentionally putting off your wife who's in labor, then missing the birth, all because 'the boys' were watching the game and it was all more important than ME - NOPE. I'd be DONE. In my book, this is unforgivable. You can't come back from that. I couldn't continue to be with someone who very clearly doesn't care. \n\n\nYou have a real problem  - not only did he ditch you when you needed him, he lied to his parents  to come off as the caring, helpful, hero of a husband, then has the nerve to get mad at YOU ??? HE'S to blame for being embarrassed. Maybe if he wasn't such a selfish asshole, his parents wouldn't be embarrased, disgusted and disappointed  - HE did this to himself. Why on earth does he think he gets to lie to make himself look good  - and the simple fact that he lied at all, just shows you that he *knew* it was wrong, he just didn't care. And I see that this is something that he does regularly  - puts you & the kids behind his friends, sports,  and whatever else his selfish wants. \n\n\nYour husband has no right being mad at you. And I'd make sure to let his parents know how he treated you & what he said,  after you left them. Keep calling him out on his shit !! He needs to act like the husband and father that he is - he's not a teenager , where all that matters is your social life. He needs to grow up and do better ! Your husband is the massive, inconsiderate, selfish, asshole.",

I went through exhausting period while I was nearing my due date. I was experiencing discomfort and wanted my husband by my side when I go into labor but he'd go out every night to hang out at his friend's place and watch football games. I suggested that he play video games at home just in case but he was having none of it and said he had to attend game night at his brother's place along with his buddies. He said they had certain rituals when watching a game and he can't enjoy doing it at home or anywhere else.\n\nThe night of our son's birth my water broke while my husband was at his buddies place watching a game. I called him and told him too get home and take me to the hospital he said he was coming but he didn't. I ended up calling my sister and she took me too the hospital. My husband showed up 2hrs later after he kept calling asking if I was still in labor and that he was almost done watching the game.\n\nHe was able to make it on time for our son's birth but I was furious with him, mad and disappointed. He apologized profoundly and has been working on regaining my trust and respect for him after what he's done. He's otherwise very supportive and involved in our son's care.\n\nLast night I was at my in-laws house for dinner and we were talking about my son's birth date. My husband suddenly started \"recalling\" what happened that night and basically started lying about driving me to the hospital, waiting and feeling stressed out. I was confused I said no none of this was true none or this happened in fact, he was watching a game when I went into labor and wanted him to drive me to the hospital and didn't show upon til 2 hours later. My mother in law lost it on him yelling asking him if that was true and he kept quiet. He started berating him telling him to sit down and shut up when he stood up to argue then told him to stand up when he was sitting arguing. Everyone was laughing at how she basically treated him as if he was a boy in trouble She kept saying \"Shame shame shame on you, this is not how's I raised my children to treat their wives, Jordan you are a disgrace and I'm disappointed because of what I heard about you\". He literally swallowed every but of his mother's berating and didn't say anything til we got home where he went nuts saying I made him look neglectful a bad husband and father by telling the family about where he was and said I shouldn't have said anything but I argued it wasn't okay for him to lie and play hero in front of his parents. He said I just caused a rift between him and family and asked if I was happy now.\n\naita? Should I have not said anything?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He waited until it was convenient for HIM to come to the hospital while you were in labor, presumably scared, and in pain. His mother berating him is exactly what he deserves in this situation, and so so so much more. He knew you were in labor, he chose to sit and watch the game anyway. \nYour MIL didn\u2019t raise him like that and I\u2019d be pissed too! If he\u2019s doing anything less than giving you back massages, foot rubs, catering to everything you need, and apologizing constantly, it\u2019s not enough! You pushed a BABY out of your body and he showed up at the last minute and now he has the AUDACITY to play hero?? Over a GAME?? \nHis priorities are so messed up and if I could yell at him the way your MIL did I would. Don\u2019t feel bad for \u201cmaking him look bad\u201d, HE was raised to not act like that and made himself look bad. He never should have acted that way, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019d have outed his actions over nothing. He went as far as to lie and play the poor, stressed out hero for sympathy.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. He prioritized watching the game over your son being born, full stop. He waited until it was convenient for HIM to come to the hospital while you were in labor, presumably scared, and in pain. His mother berating him is exactly what he deserves in this situation, and so so so much more. He knew you were in labor, he chose to sit and watch the game anyway. \nYour MIL didn\u2019t raise him like that and I\u2019d be pissed too! If he\u2019s doing anything less than giving you back massages, foot rubs, catering to everything you need, and apologizing constantly, it\u2019s not enough! You pushed a BABY out of your body and he showed up at the last minute and now he has the AUDACITY to play hero??

He deserved every bit of embarrassment and yelling.</p>\n</div>",
