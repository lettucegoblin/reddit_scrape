You reacted appropriately when you found out.\n\nYour husband doesn't feel his decisions should be challenged, which is why he became cold. He saw the necklace at the time as *his* property to do with as he saw fit. The necklace was a way to give his other daughter a nice gift without spending any money. He never saw any of his wife's possessions as property of his daughter or something she had any right to, so he sees his daughter's emotional response as controlling and childish. He believes his decision being respected is more important than his child's feelings. He believes that now the decision has been made, his daughter has to get over it because he can't do anything else and neither can she.\n\nBecause of this authoritarian view of his role in the family, he operates on the belief he did everything he could to help his daughter. Yes, he got her therapy, but she returned from therapy to gaslighting by her dad and constant reminders that her feelings and perspective don't matter. This also allows him to believe that she ruined his marriage (there are missing facts there, too) and that it is her responsibility to fix their relationship. He gets emotional validation being a victim.\n\nHe also doesn't think you have a right to challenge his decisions or to feel the way you do about his past actions. He expects you to validate his feelings regardless of what he actually did, which is why he never gave you details about the specific conflict. The fact that you didn't support his view of the situation after finding out was considered by him as a betrayal, and he will use this against you. He does not have healthy ways of dealing with negative feelings.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA - Your husband left out key details about the demise of his relationship with his daughter. You reacted appropriately when you found out.</p>\n\n<p>Your husband doesn&#39;t feel his decisions should be challenged, which is why he became cold. He saw the necklace at the time as <em>his</em> property to do with as he saw fit. The necklace was a way to give his other daughter a nice gift without spending any money. He never saw any of his wife&#39;s possessions as property of his daughter or something she had any right to, so he sees his daughter&#39;s emotional response as controlling and childish. He believes his decision being respected is more important than his child&#39;s feelings. He believes that now the decision has been made, his daughter has to get over it because he can&#39;t do anything else and neither can she.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this authoritarian view of his role in the family, he operates on the belief he did everything he could to help his daughter. Yes, he got her therapy, but she returned from therapy to gaslighting by her dad and constant reminders that her feelings and perspective don&#39;t matter. This also allows him to believe that she ruined his marriage (there are missing facts there, too) and that it is her responsibility to fix their relationship. He gets emotional validation being a victim.</p>\n\n<p>He also doesn&#39;t think you have a right to challenge his decisions or to feel the way you do about his past actions. He expects you to validate his feelings regardless of what he actually did, which is why he never gave you details about the specific conflict. The fact that you didn&#39;t support his view of the situation after finding out was considered by him as a betrayal, and he will use this against you. He does not have healthy ways of dealing with negative feelings.</p>\n</div>",

So let's give Annie a pessimistic two years with all living parents, and let's give the husband and ex a generous year of dating before having a kid (but let's be real, it was probably longer unless Amy was an accident).  Okay, so that means, if accurate, that Annie would have been six or seven when the whole death thing happened and, oof, at around seven when the dating started.  Not great.",

No wonder she\u2019s kept it this long and refuses to part with it. And no wonder she\u2019s let it go to crap. Because she doesn\u2019t actually care about the necklace itself, but that she got someone to steal something very important from someone else and then give it to her. So maybe it\u2019s not a treasure to her. It\u2019s just a trophy.\n\nIt\u2019s her trophy for being instrumental in stomping on the pieces of Annie\u2019s already-broken heart.\n\nEdit: Is there no way to take it back for Annie somehow? Because this would be a dealbreaker for me, but I wouldn\u2019t leave before trying to get it back to its rightful owner. Please try to get it back. If any of the thieves gets upset, you can just tell them to GET OVER IT\n\nEdited again bc I mistakenly wrote that the girls are bio and stepdaughter and not first- and second-born half-sisters.\n\nAnd I almost feel like them being bio sisters makes it worse. Like, if Amy were a step, then it could have been Amy and her mom trying to erase the earlier family and doing what they could to pretend it hadn\u2019t existed (except for Annie). But as a bio family, it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re acknowledging that Annie and her mother did exist, but that Amy and her mother are more important and always will be. And to prove it, here is something important of her mother\u2019s that Annie desperately wants, so Amy will keep it and treat it like shit, as she should.
