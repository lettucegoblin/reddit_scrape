The aunt and uncle and kids are getting kicked out. They are going to have emotions about this, and probably not good ones. Sure, we hope they will take this moment to look inward and self reflect on their homophobic ways, and suddenly have a revelation and become accepting toward queer people. But do we think that is really going to happen? Or is it more likely the family will double down on their bigotry and take it out on other people, other LGBTQ+ people they meet because of this perceived injustice? Does this create greater divisiveness as a more long term result? \n\nMy issue here is how we handle situations, and how we develop empathy. We are so insistent on people being empathetic to us and our needs, sometimes we forget to put ourselves in other people's shoes and be empathetic towards them. In this way, we not only become assholes ourselves, but we also don't actually make things better in bigger picture when we nearsightedly behave in vindictive and punishing ways. Sometimes (many times), we might miss the forest for the trees, and we become nearsighted in our own (very justifiable) hurt and pain, and then we wield whatever power we have to punish others.\n\nThis is probably going to be buried, but I'd be curious to hear other thoughts. \n\nAnd, if it is relevant at all, I'm queer myself and have experience being rejected by family and by family friends, and have been doing LGBTQ+ activism, scholarship, and community work for almost 15 years. These are things I constantly think about, and I really don't have a good answer to this.",

Sure, we hope they will take this moment to look inward and self reflect on their homophobic ways, and suddenly have a revelation and become accepting toward queer people. But do we think that is really going to happen? Or is it more likely the family will double down on their bigotry and take it out on other people, other LGBTQ+ people they meet because of this perceived injustice? Does this create greater divisiveness as a more long term result? </p>\n\n<p>My issue here is how we handle situations, and how we develop empathy. We are so insistent on people being empathetic to us and our needs, sometimes we forget to put ourselves in other people&#39;s shoes and be empathetic towards them. In this way, we not only become assholes ourselves, but we also don&#39;t actually make things better in bigger picture when we nearsightedly behave in vindictive and punishing ways. Sometimes (many times), we might miss the forest for the trees, and we become nearsighted in our own (very justifiable) hurt and pain, and then we wield whatever power we have to punish others.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably going to be buried, but I&#39;d be curious to hear other thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>And, if it is relevant at all, I&#39;m queer myself and have experience being rejected by family and by family friends, and have been doing LGBTQ+ activism, scholarship, and community work for almost 15 years. These are things I constantly think about, and I really don&#39;t have a good answer to this.</p>\n</div>",

He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it\u2019s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.\n\nMy whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. \nIn college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. \n\nDuring visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren\u2019t married we weren\u2019t allowed to share a bed. We didn\u2019t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.\n\nDuring Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.\n\nThe 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. \n\nThey snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband\u2019s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That\u2019s when I saw red. \n\nI started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn\u2019t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house \u2014 that was still in my parents\u2019 name.\n\nMy bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in \u201ctheir\u201d house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn\u2019t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.\n\nThe kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.\n\nI told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.\n\nI want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No. Ownership isn\u2019t really the point of what is considered to be one\u2019s home, though. Rent is enough. \n\nFor the record, I love your dad.

They then take off and get pregnant by dad.\n\nThis part: \u201cincluding a lovely scene of the girl crawling on her hands and knees to the door of their home, begging to be let in\u201d comes from the story of the Levite\u2019s concubine (Judges 19-21). A second story that is very similar to that of Lot and the Angels where a town comes under condemnation by threatening to have sex with someone under the protection of hospitality. \n\nIn that a Levite and his concubine traveled through Gibeah and stayed the night. A completely different group of men surrounded the house and demand to have sex with the Levite. The host offers his daughter and his guest\u2019s concubine to the men\u2026 they the men r*p*ed the concubine to death and when he got up in the morning she was found clinging to the door of the house. So he took her home and chopped her into 12 parts and sent her parts on a tour across Israel. Everyone was so pissed that the Levite had been mistreated they promptly went to war and killed most the men and either killed or enslaved all the Benjaminite women. \n\nThen when they realized the tribe of Benjamin was about to die out they sacked an entirely different city to enslave their women to give them to the tribe who had r*p*ed the Levite\u2019s concubine in the first place to be their slaves/wives *and* allowed the Benjaminites to kidnap other women as \u201cwives,\u201d because apparently the cure for a heinous act of r*p*e is a whole bunch more r*p*e.",
