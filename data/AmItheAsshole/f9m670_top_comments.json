        "body": "YTA. Your daughter has to interact with these girls on a day to day basis. You just made her life at school a living hell. Going into highschool? That's rough. She has a target on her back now. Better get the therapists ready for the amount of bullying that's about to ensue. Kids (especially teenagers) are dumb. They don't understand the effect they're actions have emotionally on eachother. Yes she's a brat, she's also your daughter's friend. Just because you don't like her doesn't mean your daughter doesn't (weather you like it or not). 14? I doubt they're this coniving yet, but, for all you know your daughter is trying to keep peace for herself in highschool(friends close enemies closer thing). Your job is to let your daughter confront the bully, and deal with the situation, and support her doing it HER way first. Not confront them for her.

And be there for her when it doesn't work they way she thinks. Personally, I think you should have pulled SB's mom over at pick up the next day, explain what had happened, and that your not comfortable with the behaviour, it's bullying, and it will not continue, of it does, that you will address it with SB and a school staff, and your daughter together if it continues and her mother won't speak with her.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>YTA. Your daughter has to interact with these girls on a day to day basis. You just made her life at school a living hell. Going into highschool? That&#39;s rough. She has a target on her back now. Better get the therapists ready for the amount of bullying that&#39;s about to ensue. Kids (especially teenagers) are dumb. They don&#39;t understand the effect they&#39;re actions have emotionally on eachother. Yes she&#39;s a brat, she&#39;s also your daughter&#39;s friend. Just because you don&#39;t like her doesn&#39;t mean your daughter doesn&#39;t (weather you like it or not). 14? I doubt they&#39;re this coniving yet, but, for all you know your daughter is trying to keep peace for herself in highschool(friends close enemies closer thing). Your job is to let your daughter confront the bully, and deal with the situation, and support her doing it HER way first. Not confront them for her. She will never learn how to fight for herself if you defend her, let her take a shot at protecting herself, give her the advice, let her make her own choices and choose the course of action she wants to take.

When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.\n\nThe whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a \"super duper cool girl\".\n\nAnyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)\n\nThe final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.\n\nthe SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.\n\nMy daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying \"why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??\". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.\n\nMy daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:\n\nD \"hey its me\"\n\nSB \"thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha\"\n\nD \"what\"\n\nSB: \"arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts\"\n\nSB \"slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool\"\n\nD \"u dont like the party..?\"\n\nSB \"I jus wish i could go home looool\"\n\n\\~end\n\nIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).\n\nI took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said \"because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go.\" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.\n\nI talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said \"its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.\"\n\nI thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.\n\nMy wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her.

        "body": "NTA We threw a huge Halloween party for my 14yo a couple years ago.  There were 40 kids running around, playing games, taking pictures, sitting by the fire.  There were 2 girls who I have known since pre-school sitting out of the activities.  I though maybe they had been excluded but when I checked in I got a ton of snark about how there was NOTHING to do and this was SO lame.  Listening to the raucous shouts, laughter and watching the other party goers whizz by it was totally clear that their disaffection was 100% intentional.  I should have sent them home.  A great party by all other accounts was really tarnished by these 2 going to school and telling everyone they had a bad time.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA We threw a huge Halloween party for my 14yo a couple years ago.  There were 40 kids running around, playing games, taking pictures, sitting by the fire.  There were 2 girls who I have known since pre-school sitting out of the activities.  I though maybe they had been excluded but when I checked in I got a ton of snark about how there was NOTHING to do and this was SO lame.

Newsflash OP, this is textbook teenager behavior.\n\n2. OP didnt like teenager from the minute she walked I'm his door because she didnt kiss his ass? Like yeah she could have said hi and greeted them but again, teenagers. It's a phase.\n\n3. He didnt get mad about his daughter being upset, he didnt get mad until teenager trashed his gift. Trust me in know phones are expensive and they did a good job with her gift but someone was bound to make a comment about it because teens are snarky, this girl just did it first. He threw out a 14 year old because she laughed at the gift. Again, she wasnt even bullying the daughter like OP is making it out to be. Snarky is not bullying.\n\n4. At this age teens NEED to learn conflict resolution, but daughter and the teen would have gotten over it and talked about it or just moved on. Because....they're 14. But he robbed his kid and the teen of this learning opportunity that they should have worked out on their own. Again, it would be different if the girl was bullying his daughter, but she wasnt. \n\n5. He tried to justify his actions by saying the girls were laughing ang giggling after the other girl left. So hes leading us to believe that they weren't laughing and having a good time before he threw the teen out? I dont believe this at all.\n\n6. He made the decision all on his own, didnt even talk to his SPOUSE about this! Who the fuck makes decisions like this without informing their spouse or asking their daughter about that they want? This behavior is concerning, if he makes decisions like this about someone making fun of his gift and blames it on what is actual normal teen girl interaction then that's very concerning and controlling. OP isn't being a good parent, hes controlling the situation but for all the wrong reasons. \n\nIm not understanding how no one else is seeing this. I usually agree with most of these AITA rulings, but this one is just feeding into people's justice boners and they arent really looking into all aspects of the situation.\n\nEdit to add: there is a very serious epidemic with bullying, it has become so prevalent and dangerous that more action needs to be taken when it occurs. But catty remarks about a gift and calling a party lame ARE not bullying and throwing around an insinuation that this behavior is bullying is worrying and fanning fuel to a fire that doesnt exist in this situation. I am assuming that OP is implying it because he knows that it will garner sympathy to him and stroke his ego, which redditors are falling for.\n\nEdit again: OP justified his behavior by saying the girl was making the party all about her but there is no evidence that he provides that proves that, the other responses are calling the girl a bully which is why I mention it so much.",

Be prepared to have more meetings in school with both these girls and the other girl&#39;s mother, OP, because this ain&#39;t over.</p>\n</div>",

OP did the right thing by being aware of what was going on at the party between the daughter and her friends and acting on it, not just letting legitimate bullying go as a way to not embarrass her daughter. My mom has kicked friends out of my room and house because they were being disrespectful or alienating me and although young me was worried about hurting my friends feelings and the aftermath, my mom also explained that she won\u2019t stand by and let shit happen to me and that it\u2019s her job to make sure that I at least feel safe and protected at home.\n\nEDIT: NTA obviously\n\nEdit 2: to be clear, I\u2019m extremely aware that 14 year olds deal with social issues that cause them to be have issues later on in life. The point I\u2019m making is that a 14 year olds social standing at school does not compare to their parent defending them in situations where they feel belittled. If there was a scenario where I felt my child was being bullied at school, let alone in my own house, I will address it by removing the person who is causing it. Now, if this causes any further issues afterwards at school, as a parent you should be ready to deal with that. This girl needs to know that she has an advocate for her. \n\nLastly, it\u2019s OPs house, not the daughter\u2019s house. They may tell anyone to leave at any time if someone is not adhering to the rules of the house or making anyone feel inferior. I would feel the same way if there was a completely different girl at the sleepover being belittled at the party by the spoiled brat and OP stepped in and told the brat to go home. He\u2019s protecting the children currently under his care.",

Trust me I tried that and it made things exponentially worse. \n\nYou cannot control the other kids, you cannot make them include your child, you cannot control the things they will say to your child when there are no adults around, you cannot make them be nice to her. You can go to the principal, teachers, and parents all you want but nothing said or done will force them to include or be friends with her. In fact the more the parent gets involved the worse it gets, the more ammunition they get and the more embarrassing for the child. \n\nI tried when me daughter was being bullied and the most that happened was animosity between the adults involved, be the time it was done the principal hated my face and even started taking it out on my daughter. By the end he refused to even listen when they did things to her and even started laying the blame on her for being bullying in the first place. I ended up just having to transfer schools.

Classism should be discouraged, and kids do need guidance and lessons.\n\nBut let's not pretend this guy is some kind of hero for snooping, making a teenager cry, and kicking her out at 1 AM over some text messages. He's an asshole, a way bigger asshole than her. What exactly is the lesson here? Make decisions based on emotions in the heat of the moment? Being a huge asshole is okay as long as you felt justified? There's no such thing as privacy? There is no lesson here. This was only about OP wanting to make a power play after getting his feelings hurt. He didn't consider his daughter's feelings at all, as he said in other comments it was the heat of the moment and he immediately went up after reading the messages.\n\nThe girl who got kicked out isn't going to look back at this and go \"maybe I should critically examine my own entitlement\". She's gonna remember that her friend's crazy dad read her private messages, dramatically and ominously confronted her in front of everyone at 1AM, made her cry, and kicked her out of the house. OP thinks that because the girls were laughing afterwards that this is all over and done with and that he's done his daughter a service by protecting her from the big mean classist spoiled brat.

Classism should be discouraged, and kids do need guidance and lessons.</p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s not pretend this guy is some kind of hero for snooping, making a teenager cry, and kicking her out at 1 AM over some text messages. He&#39;s an asshole, a way bigger asshole than her. What exactly is the lesson here? Make decisions based on emotions in the heat of the moment? Being a huge asshole is okay as long as you felt justified? There&#39;s no such thing as privacy? There is no lesson here. This was only about OP wanting to make a power play after getting his feelings hurt. He didn&#39;t consider his daughter&#39;s feelings at all, as he said in other comments it was the heat of the moment and he immediately went up after reading the messages.</p>\n\n<p>The girl who got kicked out isn&#39;t going to look back at this and go &quot;maybe I should critically examine my own entitlement&quot;. She&#39;s gonna remember that her friend&#39;s crazy dad read her private messages, dramatically and ominously confronted her in front of everyone at 1AM, made her cry, and kicked her out of the house. OP thinks that because the girls were laughing afterwards that this is all over and done with and that he&#39;s done his daughter a service by protecting her from the big mean classist spoiled brat. But really he just embarrassed his daughter, taught her that she can&#39;t expect any privacy on her phone, and probably made her social life much more difficult moving forwards.</p>\n</div>",

Even the mere example of what being assertive looks like I think will benefit her so much in the long run. NTA, not in the least.</p>\n</div>",

Sometimes having your parents just come in and make decisions for you like that is really damaging as well, it's treating you like you're not a real person with your own agency to manage your own life. Parents need to create a safe space for their kids to make these kinds of decisions, give them advice and back them up and be there for them.

After that, a parent can propose a good course of action and still leave room for the teen's input. \n\nMy ideal would be something like this (in private, of course):\n\n\"Hey honey. SB's been bullying you ever since you started opening your gifts. She's doing it low-key for deniability, but she keeps putting you down, and your friends, and your family. Well, you're worthy of respect, and you deserve to be treated like it. \n\n\"I heard that she wishes she could go home. Well, so do I. I don't welcome a guest who treats people like crap. So if it's OK with you, I'm going to make a vague excuse to pull her out, and tell her to call her mom and go. OK?\"\n\nSome feedback and discussion might follow. The daughter may be hesitant, either because she's not sure she's worth the trouble or because of potential social blowback. Dad may be able to help with these by modestly asserting his personal objections to the girl's behavior and personal right to disinvite her from his home.

So when I heard you wished you could go home, I thought it was a pretty good idea. Call your mom.\"\n\nThat might be more educational, and it's less vulnerable to the rationalization that \"He took this *one thing* I said and blew it *totally* out of proportion!\"\n\nNow, I had to write both of these pretty carefully to skirt around the whole \"I looked through my daughter's phone\" thing. That could be a breach of trust or not, it really depends on the family's norms. It's one thing if locking your phone *and* keeping it with you are typical, and the daughter quite exceptionally left hers on the coffee table, unlocked, with the message app open, facing her parents. It's another thing if leaving your phone around unlocked is normal and the burden of privacy is borne mostly by a super strict hands-off convention. And it's another thing still if there isn't a norm either way because she never had a phone before.\n\nMy current household norm is that I'm responsible for not actively looking through your device, and if I do happen to see one of your messages, I'm responsible for being unselfish and smart about it; you're responsible for making it unlikely that I *will* happen across anything sensitive.
