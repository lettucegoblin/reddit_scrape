Post partum, watching your child lose the fight for his life, planning his <em>FUNERAL</em>, and you were supposed to go above and beyond to try and get thru the roadblocks they threw in your way. </p>\n\n<p>Nope, NTA in any world. And if sis thought you should have tried harder, why didn\u2019t she go knock on their door? Blessings for healing, block the lot of them in every way possible. And change those locks, if you haven\u2019t already.</p>\n</div>",

But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please, don&#39;t think you have anything to apologise for or explain. Block everything they contact you on, move into your new flat as soon as possible, and please do keep seeing your therapist and seeking support from those who love and support you. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself</p>\n</div>",

Were you supposed to go out of your way (and pocket) to send a frigging registered letter to let them know?\n\nYOU were abandoned by the father of your child mid-pregnancy. YOU had to track him down to even know if he was safe. YOU had to go through the rest of your pregnancy alone. YOU had to go through a traumatic birth experience and then go through the horrific experience of losing your child. No help from your ex, his mother, his family or friends.\n\nYou tried more than you had to, as did your parents. Then your ex let's himself into your home to see his child, no heads up? Like what, \"honey, I'm home\"??? Apparently didn't unblock you to even know if you'd delivered, just decided \"this would be about the time there would be baby, so I'll go over and see baby even though I haven't spoken to OP for anything.\"\n\nI'm FUMING on your behalf. Just absolutely livid. At him and his side for sure, but also at your sister. I don't know wth her issue is, but I'd advise LC at the least. Are they friends or something? If so, she probably could've told him after all your attempts failed \n\nI'm so enraged on your behalf. But I'm so, so sad for you. You don't need any of this BS on top of grieving. Focus on healing, block these people trying to add to any already big pile of trauma. I'm glad you've got the support of your parents and are going to therapy. \n\nOne thing I want to say is that someone is going to try and make you feel bad about not wanting a child at the time that you learned about your pregnancy. It's terrible that they would do so, but it's inevitable. Someone horrible might also say that it's your fault this happened because of that. PLEASE listen to me - it's NOT your fault. And just because you had that initial feeling doesn't mean that you wanted any of this to happen. You figured your stuff out when abandoned by your ex and were ready to be a single mom. You were (and are) strong and loving and lovable. NONE of this is on you. \n\nNTA and I wish you well. I'm sure that this will be a long and difficult road to be \"okay\".

YOU had to go through a traumatic birth experience and then go through the horrific experience of losing your child. No help from your ex, his mother, his family or friends.</p>\n\n<p>You tried more than you had to, as did your parents. Then your ex let&#39;s himself into your home to see his child, no heads up? Like what, &quot;honey, I&#39;m home&quot;??? Apparently didn&#39;t unblock you to even know if you&#39;d delivered, just decided &quot;this would be about the time there would be baby, so I&#39;ll go over and see baby even though I haven&#39;t spoken to OP for anything.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m FUMING on your behalf. Just absolutely livid. At him and his side for sure, but also at your sister. I don&#39;t know wth her issue is, but I&#39;d advise LC at the least. Are they friends or something? If so, she probably could&#39;ve told him after all your attempts failed </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m so enraged on your behalf. But I&#39;m so, so sad for you. You don&#39;t need any of this BS on top of grieving. Focus on healing, block these people trying to add to any already big pile of trauma. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got the support of your parents and are going to therapy. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I want to say is that someone is going to try and make you feel bad about not wanting a child at the time that you learned about your pregnancy. It&#39;s terrible that they would do so, but it&#39;s inevitable. Someone horrible might also say that it&#39;s your fault this happened because of that. PLEASE listen to me - it&#39;s NOT your fault. And just because you had that initial feeling doesn&#39;t mean that you wanted any of this to happen. You figured your stuff out when abandoned by your ex and were ready to be a single mom. You were (and are) strong and loving and lovable. NONE of this is on you. </p>\n\n<p>NTA and I wish you well. I&#39;m sure that this will be a long and difficult road to be &quot;okay&quot;. All the good thoughts in the world to you. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s just not worth it, don&#39;t believe them. You are beyond NTA.</p>\n</div>",

He had no sympathy from me.<br/>\n3) OP was and is stressed, yet did everything they could within reason to inform this guy,  while dealing with the funerary arrangements and grief of not only losing said child but the loss of the relationship too. </p>\n\n<p>If this guy finds this, I how he reads all the comments against him and his family. </p>\n\n<p>Every attempt was made.  You just made yourself especially unavailable to receive it, so you&#39;re the AH here.  You are a coward.  You ran away.  You rejected all communication.  You have no right to be angry or upset at the turn of events. Your ex had every right to be angry, sad, disappointed and then some with your slimy behavior. May you never receive the blessing of what you just threw away again - a loving partner,  children, etc.   </p>\n\n<p>As for your sister... &quot;tbf&quot;, your sister did reach out. Continously. It makes you a really shitty person to try and play devils advocate for the slime ball who ran away from his responsibilities and then blocked all forms of communication.  What was your sister suppose to do? Send a certified letter from a lawyer? A carrier pigeon? A sign from the almighty? He was contacted and never responded.  He only turned up when he was finally ready to face his responsibility,  and when he realized his fuck up,  he blamed your sister for his failings.</p>\n</div>",

He left because he was overwhelmed by your pregnancy so you had to go through the pregnancy, birth and death of your son without your child's other parent there to support you.

He and his family were no-shows for this major life event because they were totally unaware of  your attempt to get in touch after they blocked you and before they blocked you, they ignored you.
