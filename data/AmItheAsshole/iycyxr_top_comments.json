You come across like one of those people who threatens their significant other whenever they don't obey you. I think you should be in counseling regardless because you really come across as mentally unwell.\n\nThat being said, MIL is clearly the asshole for violating your wishes. The fact is that if she violates these wishes, what other wishes will she violate? But, she also violated these wishes because she truly believes that her grandchild's soul is at risk. The thing about true believers is that they honestly believe the shit they're saying. They believe that Jesus died for their sins and they believe that the world flooded and two of every animal were carried onto a boat and they believe that we're all the products of one family tree. It's fucking bonkers what religious people believe but they believe it.\n\nThat being said, you're the asshole too for your reaction. Your behavior is ridiculous. You don't tell your wife, you ask and discuss and come to an agreement. You are so desperate for control and power that you're willing to burn down your entire marriage to get it. That's mental. Do you have any idea how mental it is? You could have said that she only has supervised visits for a year. You could have said her mother has to go to counseling with you both. You could have started somewhere reasonable but you immediately jumped to the most extreme option and then demanded compliance. It's mental man.\n\nLet's look at your relative reasons for divorce:\n\n- If your wife decides to divorce you it'll be because you became furious over a baptism and made decisions without her, attempted to limit contact with her family, refused to compromise, and gave ultimatums.\n\n- If you decided to divorce your wife over this it would be because you became furious over a baptism and she refused to obey you.\n\nHow could you not realize that you're an asshole here? How could you possibly feel justified in behaving like such a child? Over a baptism? It's literally a sprinkle of water. I really think that this has nothing to do with the baptism and has everything to do with power and control and wanting complete obedience and being willing to threaten and emotionally abuse your spouse to get it. And your responses in this thread definitely come across that way man. \n\nSeriously, even if you don't end up in couple's counseling, get some personal counseling for your control issues because it is not this normal to become so hostile you're willing to divorce over something like this.",

If so, is it possible you are being unusually harsh and trying to punish MIL and FIL for other things? Healthy boundaries are important, but if your method of dealing with things is to freeze people out with the silent treatment, it will be hard to reach that goal.

Your style of handling this so far does not seem particularly mature. I hope this is the worst thing you ever go through, but I can pretty well promise you this pales in comparison to what is ahead of you if you don't get your act together. You may be so angry now (even though A MONTH has gone by) that you talk big about being divorced from your spouse, and see divorce as a possibility because of your MIL's action.  That is nuts!

        "body": "ESH (Except your wife).  The thing about religion is that people truly believe in it.  Your mother in law believes with all her heart that her beloved grandchild would be tortured for all of time if he didn't get baptized.  So just as a responsible parent would sneak a child out to get vaccines if the other parent was a rabid anti-vaxer, she snuck him out to save his soul.\n\nThis was still a major beach of your trust, and you guys should absolutely discuss boundaries and lay down some hard lines, but depriving your son of a relationship with his grandparents is not the appropriate action here, especially if this the only boundary she's crossed.  And you absolutely need counseling if her touching your son with water so enraged you that you could barely restrain yourself from screaming at her and then your wife.  Plus, what would you have done if your wife changed her stance and wanted to baptise you guys' son in a year or so?  Would you freak out on her and forbid her from seeing her child without you present?\n\nI'm completely with your wife on this. \n Ultimately, what does it matter that your son got touched with the magic water?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>ESH (Except your wife).  The thing about religion is that people truly believe in it.  Your mother in law believes with all her heart that her beloved grandchild would be tortured for all of time if he didn&#39;t get baptized.  So just as a responsible parent would sneak a child out to get vaccines if the other parent was a rabid anti-vaxer, she snuck him out to save his soul.</p>\n\n<p>This was still a major beach of your trust, and you guys should absolutely discuss boundaries and lay down some hard lines, but depriving your son of a relationship with his grandparents is not the appropriate action here, especially if this the only boundary she&#39;s crossed.  And you absolutely need counseling if her touching your son with water so enraged you that you could barely restrain yourself from screaming at her and then your wife.  Plus, what would you have done if your wife changed her stance and wanted to baptise you guys&#39; son in a year or so?  Would you freak out on her and forbid her from seeing her child without you present?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m completely with your wife on this. \n Ultimately, what does it matter that your son got touched with the magic water?

One parent being primarily in charge of finding child care, and the other parent delegating those domestic tasks to them, is something OP should also consider when a <em>finding an alternative solution.</em></p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m speculating but I\u2019m guessing if OP\u2019s wife was raised Catholic, she\u2019s probably internalized a lot of sexist and misogynistic false beliefs about herself as a woman and a mother, and may feel like she\u2019s failed either her son and husband, or her mother when she hasn\u2019t actually failed anyone yet. She might just need some help. Be kind to her. Don\u2019t blame her for the sins of her mother.</p>\n</div>",

I mean, you kind of go off about OP's unilateral decision and then quickly sidestep the unilateral decision the grandparents made, literally give them a pass on it... I get it, it's \"just water\" and it's really easy to brush off, hit submit, and move on. But there's too much else to discuss that I'm disappointed to not see mentioned here at all.\n\nTo start, what they did caused a major breakdown in trust between OP and them. **He has his own faith**, which I highlight because some of you keep ignoring that, like his faith doesn't matter, which is exactly what his in-laws indicated, intentionally or not, by doing what they did behind his back. Religion is often passed down through families. There's a reason it's so location/culture-based. There's a reason you almost never see, say, a family of 5 in which dad is Jewish, mom is Catholic, kid 1 is Buddhist, kid 2 is Atheist, and kid 3 is Catholic. You just don't see a lot of mixing within families, because religion is taught. When you do see someone break away, it can cause anger and pain. When my MiL, who grew up Catholic, became an Independent Baptist, they poked fun at her until she broke down in tears - they still poke fun of each others' traditions and behaviors. My husband's departure from the church caused a years-long fight, a year of no speaking, and an eventual reconciliation when they gave up on bullying him back into the church. One of my husband's cousins decided he was Atheist and they talk about him like he's injecting heroin into his eyeballs. Religions very rarely mix well within families. So when OP and his wife decided to wait, to respect each other's faith, that was a fair call on their part. When her parents decided to piss on that, it immediately put him on the defensive. This is the consequence of being dishonest and shady, people begin to see you as dishonest and shady, and they respond to you accordingly. He simply cannot trust that the baptism was the first and last act of religious indoctrination his kid will be subjected to, *that's* the problem, not the baptism alone.\n\nNow, he definitely needs to talk to his wife because \"putting your foot down\", so to speak, is never going to yield a productive result. He really needs to ask his wife how certain she feels that this was a one-time thing, that they understand what they did wrong, that they won't do it again. *He needs, and deserves, to feel assured.* It's a shame that you don't really feel for him at all in this case when religion is obviously pretty much straight up emotion, that's how you get these kinds of conflicts in the first place. A bad behavior was met with a bad behavior and handled by bad behavior ad nauseam. Pretty clear ESH to me.",

        "body": "Yeah, this was my reaction, too. The family commits the child to Catholicism when they're too young to make a decision themselves *purely* to save the kid's soul from purgatory in case they die young. The kid then has two further opportunities to commit *themselves* to the church: first communion at \"the age of reason,\" which is 7 years old, and then confirmation at their coming of age, which is 12 or 13. I personally think both of those ages are too young, since kids at those ages are still under the thumbs of their families, but that's beside the point. The church doesn't consider baptism the *child's* personal commitment to the church, and gives the child two further opportunities to decide.\n\nThe only way a baptism by itself is a problem is if OP lives in the seventeenth century and genuinely believes that the wrong take on Christianity will doom his child to hell. Otherwise, all it is is his MIL overstepping; i.e. something that has no meaning to the child himself.\n\nLikewise, the only way the baptism as a symbol is a problem is if the MIL is always overstepping and this is just the most blatant and disrespectful example among many. If this is the first and only time MIL has gone against the parents' wishes, I think OP is TA. So there's a whole backstory here that needs to be clarified.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, this was my reaction, too. The family commits the child to Catholicism when they&#39;re too young to make a decision themselves <em>purely</em> to save the kid&#39;s soul from purgatory in case they die young. The kid then has two further opportunities to commit <em>themselves</em> to the church: first communion at &quot;the age of reason,&quot; which is 7 years old, and then confirmation at their coming of age, which is 12 or 13.
