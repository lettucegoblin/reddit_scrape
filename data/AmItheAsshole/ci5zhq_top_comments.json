While those memories can provide good inspiration for your path through fatherhood, they are currently acting to impair your good judgment and may make you sacrifice all you hold dear in the name of reliving or mimicking those memories. </p>\n\n<p>You need to sell it, grovel, apologize, get a second job, replace the money with interest, make up with your in-laws, commit to consensus on any decisions of this magnitude going forward, and get some intensive counseling. You might consider writing a letter, after the counseling, to your future daughter to help her understand the impact of parent relationships and what they can do to your judgment. No sense in leaving her with more daddy issues than you are already actively creating. </p>\n\n<p>To those saying this is the single cause for a divorce, I am glad to see there are so many beings of perfection here. Maybe the first recommendation should be to get counseling and try to let the imperfect human learn from their mistakes, make amends/reparations, and keep the family together. Obviously, if this is a consistent pattern of behavior it likely won\u2019t be altered and something more extreme is appropriate. However, I think this guy is blinded by grief he didn\u2019t know existed and should get a chance to resolve it and make things right.</p>\n</div>",

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nSo how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area.

He traded in his paid off sedan, and got a loan for the remaining $50,000.  When I sat him down and took him through our finances, and showed him there was no way we could pay for it, he said he would take it back.  He didn\u2019t. He hid the car from both me and his family until the (I think) 5 day return policy had passed.  He refused to take responsibility for it,  he blamed me because apparently I should have somehow hunted him down and stopped him from buying it. This was before cell phone gps, and I still don\u2019t understand how he thinks I would have tracked him down.  I would NEVER have thought he was capable of being this person.  But over the next 3 years, the person I married was replaced by a selfish, controlling, irresponsible person.  We ended up having to sell the car, which lost tons of value, for 23,000.  Which meant we were down one car, and owed 27,000 on a loan with nothing to show for it.  I ended up having to go back to work less then 2 months after our daughter was born. \n\nI hope OP\u2019s wife is smarter than me and leaves him now instead of staying for 3 more years like I did.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My ex-husband did this, except worse.  Our daughter was 2 weeks old, and he came home after being MIA for 6 hours with a brand new, all the bells and whistles, camero.  He traded in his paid off sedan, and got a loan for the remaining $50,000.  When I sat him down and took him through our finances, and showed him there was no way we could pay for it, he said he would take it back.  He didn\u2019t. He hid the car from both me and his family until the (I think) 5 day return policy had passed.  He refused to take responsibility for it,  he blamed me because apparently I should have somehow hunted him down and stopped him from buying it. This was before cell phone gps, and I still don\u2019t understand how he thinks I would have tracked him down.  I would NEVER have thought he was capable of being this person.  But over the next 3 years, the person I married was replaced by a selfish, controlling, irresponsible person.  We ended up having to sell the car, which lost tons of value, for 23,000.  Which meant we were down one car, and owed 27,000 on a loan with nothing to show for it.  I ended up having to go back to work less then 2 months after our daughter was born. </p>\n\n<p>I hope OP\u2019s wife is smarter than me and leaves him now instead of staying for 3 more years like I did.</p>\n</div>",
