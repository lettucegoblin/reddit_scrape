Including calling my husband as he helped me deliver our dead child and demanding he leave the hospital to come get our son because she needed our parents and we (husband and I) were being selfish.  This was on a voice mail.  When she didn\u2019t get her way she went on a tantrum where she told everyone on the book of faces that I needed to \u201cget over it\u201d (three days later) and that she had a miscarriage at 5 weeks and didn\u2019t need to spend three days in the hospital (I had a perforated uterus and infection so was in the hospital longer).

For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. \n\nTen years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. \n\nSo here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. \n\nSo recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can't only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't.

Tell them that ten years of extended grief about a single event probably does require therapy. Tell them that if you&#39;re wrong and she&#39;s not doing it for attention, then she needs to see a professional. Frame it as concern if you think it&#39;ll get anywhere. With luck, your sister will have her have forced and she&#39;ll have to admit that she is lying about it or she&#39;ll go to therapy, which she clearly needs for a couple of reasons.</p>\n</div>",

Losing ones parents is also common, but would you say \u201coh, this happens to everyone\u201d to a friend who is mourning the loss of their parent? \n\nAnd everyone responds to loss differently. I miscarried twice before my son was conceived. I remember it was devastating to me. Though, I will say, I had an earlier miscarriage at 7 wks and a later miscarriage at 12.5 wks. The later miscarriage was worse on me emotionally. And for me, personally, a lot of the pain was centered around feeling inept at having a child. Mourning miscarriages, for me, was less about mourning the loss of something I had and more about mourning the loss of what could have been. I know the first miscarriage was a non-viable pregnancy from the start. But the second one wasn\u2019t. I sometimes wonder what my son or daughter would have been like if they had been born. The sadness is tempered by the realization that I wouldn\u2019t have my son if I hadn\u2019t miscarried. But it still exists. \n\nI do think it\u2019s possible that the sister, 10 years later and having carried successful pregnancies, could genuinely still mourn her miscarriage. Especially if it was a later miscarriage, where she\u2019d had time to bond with the pregnancy. And later miscarriages are substantially more physically painful too. Even at just shy of 13 weeks my miscarriage physically felt closer to delivery than a period. My experience around that was a nightmare too. I went to the hospital and they basically did an ultrasound and said, you miscarried, go home. I remember having excruciating contractions, losing a ton of blood and tissue, I passed out every time I tried to sit up and I couldn\u2019t keep anything in my stomach. I remember thinking I was going to die. Looking back on it I still feel lucky that I didn\u2019t. \n\nI agree that it seems sus that OPs sister seems to be sad about the miscarriage only when OP is spending time with their mom, but it\u2019s also possible the sister has these episodes too when mom and OP aren\u2019t together, and OP just doesn\u2019t know about it because she\u2019s not there. I think the most concerning part is the mom having to leave a vacation early to go back to the sister, because 10 years should be a long enough time to develop coping mechanisms for your grief sufficient to allow you to manage. Especially when the sister has at least a husband/partner that she can lean on for support too.",

She holds these emotions over her family and there is no room for anyone else to feel because she feels something. Everything is a slight, even when it is people trying to help her. She is petty and cruel. She was jealous that my kids choose my sister for special person's day at their preschool, so she concocted a fake FBI investigation, telling my sister it had to do with the people who had custody of her foster child and that she was getting the child back. She even claimed the two year old was sexually abused! None of it was real. There was also the second surprise funeral for my oldest daughter (she died of trisomy 18 at six days old) because I had the funeral by my home and not hers and my mil helped me plan it when she wanted to do it. These people exist. And when I finally had enough, I was the bad guy. My family hates me because I, in their words, broke my poor mother's heart. Nope. I literally woke up to police at my door Saturday morning because my parents knew they couldn't come on my property without being arrested (I had to have a no trespassing order because they were stalking us) and they just wanted to give us presets for Christmas for our kids. They even cried for the officer. As soon as we mentioned the abuse the officer told us to lock the door and call if my parents showed up. \n\nSorry to unload. It has been a stressful few days. My point is that these people do exist. They likely have some kind of personality disorder, but it is impossible to know for sure with just a snap shot of what this person is like.",

She was jealous that my kids choose my sister for special person&#39;s day at their preschool, so she concocted a fake FBI investigation, telling my sister it had to do with the people who had custody of her foster child and that she was getting the child back. She even claimed the two year old was sexually abused! None of it was real. There was also the second surprise funeral for my oldest daughter (she died of trisomy 18 at six days old) because I had the funeral by my home and not hers and my mil helped me plan it when she wanted to do it. These people exist. And when I finally had enough, I was the bad guy. My family hates me because I, in their words, broke my poor mother&#39;s heart. Nope. I literally woke up to police at my door Saturday morning because my parents knew they couldn&#39;t come on my property without being arrested (I had to have a no trespassing order because they were stalking us) and they just wanted to give us presets for Christmas for our kids. They even cried for the officer. As soon as we mentioned the abuse the officer told us to lock the door and call if my parents showed up. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry to unload. It has been a stressful few days. My point is that these people do exist. They likely have some kind of personality disorder, but it is impossible to know for sure with just a snap shot of what this person is like.</p>\n</div>",
