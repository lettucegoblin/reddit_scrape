All my family members were/are involved in the church and have church based jobs. When they met my wife they loved her and embraced her as their own. We dated for 2yrs and discovered she was pregnant after we got engaged. Invitations were already given at the time and we decided to still have the wedding on date when my wife was 5 months. \n\nMy family were furious when they found out my wife was pregnant. They asked if we *even still* considered having a wedding. I said why not but they were very upset especially mom and dad who said they've always been known for their decency and good christian values and weren't willing to let this \"stain\" their reputation. as in my wife and I getting married while preg. They officially dropped out and refused to negotiate saying it was done and I have only myself to blame for this outcome and should move the wedding out of town. I was hurt I tried to change their minds and checked with other members but;\n\nMy brother said he had no intentions to look like a joke infront of his fellow church members and dropped out, My aunt pretended to be sick and said she may not be able to make it, She's 100% healthy, My cousin said he had business trip and stopped his wife and kids attend and My uncle cussed me out, torn the invitation and kicked me out.\n\n\n\nI felt terrible with no family members of my own to support me and share my joy at my wedding. I even broke down crying after the ceremony. I haven't spoken to them for months and then got busy with my 4 weeks old daughter.\nMy cousin reached out to hand me gifts and well wishes for the birth of my daughter sent from my family. I returned everything. He sat with me on behalf of the family saying I shouldn't have returned gifts that were from my family who want to see and hopefully be involved in my daughter's life. He said mom',s longing to meet her grand baby and everyone else is wanting to visit soon to celebrate my daughter's life. I asked him this question, I said wasn't my daughter the reason why the entire lot of them abandoned my wedding?. He just stared grudgingly as I went on about how they treated my daughter as something to be ashamed of and hide. He replied saying he *guaranteed* I got it all wrong and nomatter what goes down between us I can never deny that my daughter is their granddaughter/niece/etc and they're her family. He asked that I arrange for them to visit but I refused. He kept pressing the idea but I shut him down.

My parents had divorced 7yrs before this and I was living with my dad. Until some things happened and my siblings and I ended up with my dads girlfriends parents. They were very devout and finding out I was pregnant was just before I turned 18 and I wasn\u2019t married was terrible. They denied me basic things I needed. They ran the church we were going to at the time (at this point I didn\u2019t like going to church anymore due to other issues. Mainly people in this congregation weren\u2019t great. There were a few good ones, but that\u2019s it). I was forced into going and they happened to be discussing the whole sex/pregnancy before marriage is a sin and you\u2019ll go to hell thing. In front of everyone I wen to school with (it was the teenage class). They judged me so much I ended up depressed and ended up sick because I didn\u2019t eat much.

But if they are somehow able to make you feel true forgiveness, that would be nice. Note however that Feeling guilt for not forgiving (what your Cousin tried to Bring you to feel) is not forgiveness and trying that on you actually creates further required ammends.\n\nLastly there is the issue about whats best for your daughter. To put it simply, she wont miss Family she never got to know. So there is no damage in refusing contact.\nThough she might miss out on some good stuff and maybe some Bad stuff. Depends on your family. In any case you are Not TA to her.",

I would even Understand if you go full NC. Maybe you can give them a Chance to make ammends. Though I Understand that this might not be possible since the damage is done.

Note however that Feeling guilt for not forgiving (what your Cousin tried to Bring you to feel) is not forgiveness and trying that on you actually creates further required ammends.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly there is the issue about whats best for your daughter.

In 20 years, if your daughter were to be pregnant, would you abandon her, let her walk down the aisle by herself, with only her husband to be\u2019s family there to share in her joy? Of course not!\nWhen you love someone more than yourself, you are always there for them in good times and in bad. Your parents most of all, loved themselves and their standing in the community more than they loved you. That was hard for me to say, because I, an old lady on the internet, don\u2019t want you to hurt.\nYour family\u2019s selfishness is taking away some of the happiness you and your wife should be enjoying, with being newly married and being first time parents.\nIn my 60+ years, I have learned a few things. One of them is to forgive, but forgiveness is realizing that you have no control over the people who hurt you, and that it\u2019s not your place to cleanse them of their sin, that job belongs to the Almighty. You know how they are, and you let them explain their behavior to God. Let them explain that going to your wedding and sharing in your joy, would have besmirched their reputations.\nWhile you let God deal with them, you must still never forget, and never give them the opportunity to hurt you or yours again. A truly decent, loving family doesn\u2019t do what your family did. The Golden Rule says \u201c treat others as you would want to be treated\u201d, they didn\u2019t do that. Jesus said \u201c Love one another as I Love You\u201d, they didn\u2019t do that either. They are using religion as a shield and claiming to be living by the word of God, but again, they aren\u2019t.\nYour family hurt you, your wife and your child, when they turned their back on you, and I am so sorry that you had to endure that. As you stood in church and exchanged vows with your wife, it was in your head that your family wasn\u2019t there, and that thought robbed you and your wife of the complete joy that should have been yours. You can never trust your parents, siblings and extended family with your happiness again and your happiness is your wife and daughter. You can never be sure that they won\u2019t look at or treat your daughter different or even say hurtful things to her. And if you think you heard the last of getting married while pregnant, think again. You and your wife will have that thrown in your faces for a long time.\nIf a dog bites you once, you keep your distance from it from now on. Congratulations and Best Wishes on your marriage and Every Blessing on your beautiful baby girl!\nBig grandma hugs to all 3 of you",

On the other hand, they are snakes in the grass, attempting to lure you back into a version of what they call \u201cChrist-like behavior\u201d, and have you carry water as a fellow participant in their adherence to false prophecy.\n\nYou are a Christian, and I\u2019m sure there are Pastors in your life who would sympathize with your situation.

Your family needs to crack open that show-Bible they been carrying around, and seek counsel from the Word.\n3. Ask your new Mom for help with this, and ask her to protect you from your mean Mom. Let your new family know what\u2019s going on and how much their love is getting you through you right now. Foster a strong relationship with her grandmother and other relatives. Cradle that child with unconditional love every moment. Lean on the teachings, not on the preachings\u2014 let none of the \u201cexpectations\u201d of society touch your faith. Be with your new family and be secure. Then have a cookout. Everybody watch baby run to Grandma. Everybody watch OP living his best life.

If in time you feel you are willing to allow baby steps for them to rebuild trust and slowly become part of your lives, that\u2019s ok.

Even a mass murderer can be a legitimate Christian and it's nobody's place (even Christians) to tell someone else they're not really Christian because nobody has any way to prove someone does not believe something. It's a kind of gatekeeping, especially silly when you're not Christian and are gatekeeping a religion you don't even belong to.
