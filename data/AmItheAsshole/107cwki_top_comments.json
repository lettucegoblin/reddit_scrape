He has a mild heart attack and the hospital decided to use contrast dye for some tests WITHOUT first giving him a treatment to protect his kidneys. They knew he still had some kidney function left but figured it wasn't worth saving. He just let them do this.\n\nMom goes to every appointment with him now, just in case the Dr has a thoughtless idea and needs to be strong armed into not doing it.\n\nIf that were the case with op and husband I'd say n t a and the husband was being irresponsible, but the post would also obviously be way different from what we got.\n\nOP is YTA for doing this and proving that she can't be trusted with husband's medical health",
