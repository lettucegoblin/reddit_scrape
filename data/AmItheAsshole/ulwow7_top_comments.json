Even if the person offers it, I decline. That she has a life threatening allergy and both her and her father think it is OK to steal food and eat it without being aware of what's in it is ridiculous! It is extremely dangerous!\n\nYou did not label your food because it was YOUR food. It was not meant for her. If her allergy were so bad that just smelling it (as can happen for some) would cause a reaction, then the office would have most likely told everyone not to bring anything containing nuts into the office. If they did not do so, you are within your rights to bring whatever you like.  It is HER allergy and she is responsible for her own safety.  Has she done this before? It seems impossible that she thinks it's ok to do this when she's risking death. You are not at fault for her thievery!  She needs to reevaluate her priorities and make better choices. \n\nIn short, I don't see the YOU sent her into anaphylactic shock - unless you told her it was safe and she could eat it, which you did not. She did it to herself. She needs to grow up and be a responsible adult. If your boss starts arguing with you, mention, how unsafe that practice is because she doesn't know what kitchen it was prepared in or what is kept in the kitchen and unintentional cross contamination can and does occur. Ask how she protects herself from that when she takes random food from others. Suggest she bring allergy safe food if she is that allergic. Reiterate that he cannot hold you liable for his daughter's  bills unless he can prove in a court of law that you knowingly harmed her. You had no reasonable expectation she would eat that food. (Truthfully, you don't technically KNOW that the peanuts caused the reaction. Peanuts and tree nuts are quite different. I can have peanuts, for example, but not tree nuts. You didn't see a medical report stating it was the peanuts or any tree nut. You don't know. You are just being told. What if she went outside after eating and got stung by a bee and that caused it. Wild I know but the point is you don't know with 100% certainty that your lunch had anything to do with her allergy. And it was YOUR lunch, for YOU, not hers.) Definitely NOT TA.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA, it\u2019s not your responsibility to be aware of <em>someone else\u2019s</em> food allergy. That\u2019s their job. And you said it smells nutty, so unless she\u2019s got a stuffy nose, she should\u2019ve smelled the peanuts. Furthermore, I agree with everyone else on here and take this harassment to HR. Explain that you brought your lunch in a Tupperware from home and the entire box was missing. The shows that you didn\u2019t give her the food, but that she stole it. You not labeling your food because it\u2019s <em>YOUR FOOD</em> is a moot point because it\u2019s still not your responsibility to make sure who you would share it with, can actually eat it. You are 100% correct that you are fully in the clear but don\u2019t let her dad bully you. That is not okay and it needs to be stopped yesterday. Good luck and if you choose to work with your friend, I hope it goes a lot better than those clowns at your day job!</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not the OP but I&#39;m a bit crazy about peanut sauce myself.</p>\n\n<p>The basic recipe is equal parts <strong>Sesame Oil</strong> and <strong>Soy Sauce</strong>. Add in about 1/2 the amount in <strong>Peanut Butter</strong> (though I double that because fuckit!)</p>\n\n<p>Best part is you don&#39;t have to prepare it in advance - if you used a pot already to boil something, just give it a quick rinse and reuse it. It only takes like thirty seconds for the sauce to be ready, it&#39;s super quick.

If I'm not going to take one of my son's fries from his McDonald's meal because I can't be sure the fryer is dedicated to fries only, I'm SURE AS FUCK not going to steal someone's  food. \n\nJesus Christ the cognitive dissonance is strong with this young woman!!
