Especially since his own mother was offended on his behalf? What did he think saying that would accomplish, other than to belittle and demean you? The comment about FSIL\u2019s chest also makes me uncomfortable. What he said was NOT out of support or encouragement. It was intended to make you feel badly about yourself and it succeeded! Also, his family did not shun him. He left. And the response from his family would probably not have been as harsh if he hadn\u2019t hid it from them for 6 months. I also wonder what he said/did to get fired from his job\u2026. his reaction to this occurrence makes me think that he was most likely at fault and unreasonable about that too. Because his response to your comment was not reasonable IMO.",

Please update us when you leave him. NTA</p>\n</div>",
