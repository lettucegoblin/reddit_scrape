I don\u2019t like being pushed to the wire anymore than anyone else, and I can see why this delay would particularly stress out the bride. BUT, I have repeatedly, REPEATEDLY asked for the color of the dress and have not been given an answer. As it has gotten closer, I have been chewed out by multiple people for not having a dress yet, but I still haven\u2019t been given a color. I don\u2019t know what you want me to do without suddenly developing telepathy. I am waiting for the color because I don\u2019t want to disrupt the bride\u2019s vision for her wedding if I guess incorrectly, and frankly, I assume that I will also get chewed out if I guess and show up and in the wrong color. I would really appreciate it if someone would use a single cell of common sense and tell me the color of the dress you want me to buy, so I can be there for this wedding like I have wanted from the beginning. I\u2019m trying my best here, and while I am sure there is frustration on the bride/groom\u2019s part, it is almost unfathomably frustrating to be yelled at for not doing something while consistently being denied the information to accomplish that very thing. Help me help you, or if it is too much, I don\u2019t have to go. Let me know the color within the next 24 hours or I\u2019ll step down so you can find someone else, although I do want to be part of your wedding. Let me know.\u201d\n\nNTA sweet CHRIST that was frustrating to just read, I can imagine you\u2019re about to lose it right now.\n\nEDIT: screw it, I read your other comments; if she doesn\u2019t send you a straight-up screenshot of one of the dresses so you can color-match within the next few hours they can pound sand because this is batshit fuckin crazy. The only reason I\u2019m rooting for you going to this wedding is because lavender was part of my wedding color scheme and I think everyone looks fabulous in it and I\u2019m also self-involved.\n\nEdit 2: guys I rationally know not everyone looks good in lavender due to hair color/skin tone, etc. but like I said I\u2019m self-involved have lavender-tinted glasses and just think everyone looks amazing in my wedding color; I\u2019m not delusional just selfish, I promise!\n\nEdit 3: Now I\u2019ve read your edit OP. Go scorched earth with these people. Stop communicating. They\u2019re being shady jerks on purpose for whatever reason and are treating you like garbage. Screw that long ass group text I suggested. Just say this: \u201cYou all can suck a fart straight out of my butthole, that\u2019s your wedding gift; don\u2019t bother letting me know how it tastes because I\u2019m not talking to any of you anymore\u201d and then block them. Go on vacation the day of the wedding. Get one of those thread braids in your hair. Post so many pictures people start wondering if you\u2019re okay. But you are, because you\u2019ll be sipping a pina colada on the beach instead of suffering through what amounts to a ceremonious soul-sucking from actual goddamn dementors. These people could make a panda have a stress-induced heart attack. Also thank you all so much for the awards, but I would probably not give me the wholesome award anymore because my tone has now completely changed and I\u2019m not feeling very wholesome on OP\u2019s behalf. I just told them to tell their family to eat their farts, so clearly this has got me worked up past a wholesome or helpful place.",

I would really appreciate it if someone would use a single cell of common sense and tell me the color of the dress you want me to buy, so I can be there for this wedding like I have wanted from the beginning. I\u2019m trying my best here, and while I am sure there is frustration on the bride/groom\u2019s part, it is almost unfathomably frustrating to be yelled at for not doing something while consistently being denied the information to accomplish that very thing. Help me help you, or if it is too much, I don\u2019t have to go. Let me know the color within the next 24 hours or I\u2019ll step down so you can find someone else, although I do want to be part of your wedding. Let me know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>NTA sweet CHRIST that was frustrating to just read, I can imagine you\u2019re about to lose it right now.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: screw it, I read your other comments; if she doesn\u2019t send you a straight-up screenshot of one of the dresses so you can color-match within the next few hours they can pound sand because this is batshit fuckin crazy. The only reason I\u2019m rooting for you going to this wedding is because lavender was part of my wedding color scheme and I think everyone looks fabulous in it and I\u2019m also self-involved.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: guys I rationally know not everyone looks good in lavender due to hair color/skin tone, etc. but like I said I\u2019m self-involved have lavender-tinted glasses and just think everyone looks amazing in my wedding color; I\u2019m not delusional just selfish, I promise!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: Now I\u2019ve read your edit OP. Go scorched earth with these people. Stop communicating. They\u2019re being shady jerks on purpose for whatever reason and are treating you like garbage. Screw that long ass group text I suggested. Just say this: \u201cYou all can suck a fart straight out of my butthole, that\u2019s your wedding gift; don\u2019t bother letting me know how it tastes because I\u2019m not talking to any of you anymore\u201d and then block them. Go on vacation the day of the wedding. Get one of those thread braids in your hair. Post so many pictures people start wondering if you\u2019re okay. But you are, because you\u2019ll be sipping a pina colada on the beach instead of suffering through what amounts to a ceremonious soul-sucking from actual goddamn dementors. These people could make a panda have a stress-induced heart attack. Also thank you all so much for the awards, but I would probably not give me the wholesome award anymore because my tone has now completely changed and I\u2019m not feeling very wholesome on OP\u2019s behalf. I just told them to tell their family to eat their farts, so clearly this has got me worked up past a wholesome or helpful place.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "OP\n\nNTA\n\nYou are under enough stress as it is, to be dealing with this teenage highschool BS drama that the bride is doing.  it is a trap.  I am a man, a stranger on the internet and can see it is a trap.  Think about it, she wants you and all of the family to be involved.  But does not tell you the colors of the weddings, does not tell you what color of dress.  You have asked and told nothing, silence.  Yet here is the trap in itself.  If you get the wrong color of dress, chances are she will blame you for that and standing out, and any and all things going wrong on that day, will all be your fault.\n\nSo what to do.  First is stop dealing with these people.  The bride, she be a bridezilla who hates you already so there is that.  You have way too much stress in your life from your studies to be dealing with her antics to try to derail you.  So you have several choices.\n\n1)  Don't go.  Do not even bother to respond.  Tell your instructors you changed your mind and that these tests are way too important for you to miss and you will be there.  Just do not respond at all.  \n\n2)  Take a chance, choose something, and then go from there.  I would say black slinky and not from what they picked out.  If you are going to pay for it, choose and wear what you want, not what the bride chooses, \n\n3)  Now I am petty and I can tell you, after reading that, me, my sister, my brother, my father, his father, his brother, the cousins and all of that, lets just say the door once open, we do not go through, we exploit and make it where we play the long game and really have a good time with it.  The bride wants to play this game, no one can answer your questions, putting pressure on you to show up, even asking you if you hate the bride, oh baby, gold mine to help break your stress up, have a laugh and some fun.  (Think Venga Bus, play that, and lets have some fun.)  When the ask if you hate the bride, since she is doing this say Yes I hate the bride.  Never tell them why, just say yes I do.  And wait till a month before the wedding and then tell them you are thinking about not showing up.  You know all of the finals and all.  \n\nIf they bug you about the dress, tell them you ordered one, nice all snow white dress, looks lovely.  Bad, well you can send them pictures.  Any and all bridal gowns, white ballgowns, historical costumes, outlandish, any and all things, and then say, \"Oh my bad, I did not order a dress, sorry been really busy, and no one told me what color to order.\"  Or here again, with the bride, wait and then drop that did not order bombshell.  (Why should you stress about the wedding.)  \n\nOp the choice is yours, but if it were me, I would just say yeah to what ever, and then plan on not showing up and focusing on something far more important your schooling and passing, to be a far better doctor, than anyone in that wedding party have been.   And after you pass your finals, crack open a beer for me, enjoy it and then make plans for passing and relaxing.  Sides what all are they going to do if you do not show up?  \n\n(And get a bottle of champaign for either when you do graduate and become a doctor or the divorce that will happen, cause bridezillas never have long marriages, and the gall sounds like she is a bridezilla.)",

Do not hem and haw. Do imply you\u2019re doing them a favor. You\u2019re not. You and your brother are backing out because you have reason to feel excluded and unwanted. This is not something you would say now, but keep in your back pocket for the inevitable carrying on that will happen. \n\nSo you want it to be short ad sweet.
