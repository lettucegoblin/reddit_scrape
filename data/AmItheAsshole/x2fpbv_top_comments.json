She's now early more, which she likes because she enjoys helping people set up and always felt bad she couldn't.  I think her rock bottom was when we were 6 minutes late for my elementary Christmas concert that my whole family came for.  The music teacher wouldn't let me go up because I was late.  She just shook her head no and gestured to the bleachers.  We sat the whole concert and my mom was in angry tears.  I was just sad in my new Christmas dress wondering why my teacher was mad at me.  She isn't really mad at you.  She's mad at herself and how far she's pushed everyone.  She's embarrassed because of her actions.

Like everything. Both of my sister's and myself have been disappointed so many times.  \n\nGraduation ceremonies, birthday parties, even my father's retirement dinner.  It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  \n\nI have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  \n\nWe are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. \n\nMy now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quincea\u00f1era.  \n\nSo here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. \n\nWhen we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  \n\nMy mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  \n\nWhen she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  \n\nThe ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. \n\nThe problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  \n\nShe said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  \n\nMy idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  \n\nI came clean and told her about the \"special\" invitation.  \n\nShe is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  \n\nAITA,?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "I feel this in my soul lol \n\nIt\u2019s almost a problem\u2026 like I was 7 minutes late to a therapy appointment and I apologized like 100 times. Then I explained what happened. See, my dad had been diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer five days before. I\u2019m not on the greatest terms with my dad (he\u2019s an abusive alcoholic), but he\u2019s my dad and the guilt set in for all the time I lost with him going LC. Well, he stopped by my house 40 minutes before a therapy appointment. I didn\u2019t want to tell him to leave\u2026 he didn\u2019t stay long because he was tired (he had to have emergency surgery on to bypass an intestinal blockage caused by the tumor). He left and I grabbed my keys, broke half the driving rules and sprinted into the building. My therapist was like, dude, it\u2019s fine! This was important for you to have that time.\n\nBut like\u2026 he can only bill for time I\u2019m there. I cost him 7 minutes of billable time. That\u2019s literally messing with his paycheck. \n\nTHEN a fucking week later, my kid gets super sick and I take her to ER. They tell me it\u2019s probably related to the acid reflux she\u2019s been having they probably won\u2019t find anything\u2026. Yea, the CT they did as a precaution revealed major swelling of her pancreas and she was taking by ambulance to the children\u2019s hospital to be admitted. This happened at 8pm on a Thursday. My therapy appointments are 11am on Friday\u2026. I called his office and left a voicemail.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I feel this in my soul lol </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s almost a problem\u2026 like I was 7 minutes late to a therapy appointment and I apologized like 100 times. Then I explained what happened. See, my dad had been diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer five days before. I\u2019m not on the greatest terms with my dad (he\u2019s an abusive alcoholic), but he\u2019s my dad and the guilt set in for all the time I lost with him going LC. Well, he stopped by my house 40 minutes before a therapy appointment. I didn\u2019t want to tell him to leave\u2026 he didn\u2019t stay long because he was tired (he had to have emergency surgery on to bypass an intestinal blockage caused by the tumor). He left and I grabbed my keys, broke half the driving rules and sprinted into the building. My therapist was like, dude, it\u2019s fine! This was important for you to have that time.</p>\n\n<p>But like\u2026 he can only bill for time I\u2019m there. I cost him 7 minutes of billable time. That\u2019s literally messing with his paycheck. </p>\n\n<p>THEN a fucking week later, my kid gets super sick and I take her to ER. They tell me it\u2019s probably related to the acid reflux she\u2019s been having they probably won\u2019t find anything\u2026.

She actually had her follow up today and everything is fine, healing is great, all lifting restrictions have been removed. </p>\n\n<p>My dad just started his second round of chemo. He\u2019s handling it pretty well. I think a part of it is the possibility he\u2019s going to be fine. Kind of joke in our family, our last name is German so we always say it translates to stubborn. His dad had stage 3 pancreatic and beat it (it has a crazy low survival rate), then he got stage 3 prostate cancer and beat it, then he got stage 3 bladder cancer and beat it\u2026 this family persists on pure fucking stubbornness.</p>\n</div>",
