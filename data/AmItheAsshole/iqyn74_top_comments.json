I am Muslim. I was very young when 9/11 happened, as where the rest of the people in my year.\n\nThere's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk.\n\nBut today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. \n\nShe said that \"you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect.\" \n\nI obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.)\n\nShe made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said \"Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right\". I don't know why that set me off, but it did. \n\nI told her \"No, I'm just busy texting my DAD\". She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
