That's when she called to say she was on her way which was 30mins away so new ETA 9:30pm.  Now tell me, how many people are so unbearably tired at 9:30pm that they can't make a 30 min drive?

        "body": "> she doesn\u2019t really have a history of lying to me\n\nThat you know of. I really feel for you and understand that you trust her, which makes you a good partner. This situation though should prove that maybe you shouldn\u2019t trust everything she\u2019s told you in the past. \n\nThe reality of this situation is that you don\u2019t know the full story. Her details do not add up. Falling asleep in a car for 5+ hours is unheard of. Even if you prepare to sleep in your car. It is extremely uncomfortable and usually after 2 hours, you\u2019d eventually want to just get home to a bed at that point or find a place to park overnight and call a cab. There were so many obvious solutions this situation led to that she didn\u2019t think about in her story. \n\nAlso, the new phone not working? What you describe is what happens when someone\u2019s phone is OFF. If the new phone wasn\u2019t working it wouldn\u2019t have just happened suddenly like that. I\u2019m going to pose a few more questions to make you see how poorly thought through this lie is:\n\n- Why wouldn\u2019t she text/call you that she was tired before stopping to sleep in her car? Did she sound tired on your 10:15 PM call?\n\n- Why wouldn\u2019t the cops have found her? The cops know about those deserted places where people sleep in cars. In my experience, they just don\u2019t care usually unless they need to meet quotas. Sleeping in your car on the side of a road is technically illegal, so it\u2019s really unlikely she accomplished this without being seen, especially since police were already looking for her. Not to mention that the cops definitely knew that her sleeping in her car was a possibility.\n\n- Why would she just stop for a nap knowing her phone isn\u2019t working? The normal reaction in that scenario is to get to a place or person that would let you use their phone to call your loved one, who was expecting you home several hours ago. Or, ya know, get home. \n\n- I\u2019m not advocating for drowsy driving but tbh how tired could she have been after a seemingly normal day? If I were in the situation she described, I\u2019d try to stop at a 24 hr store or gas station (obviously using caution since that isn\u2019t safe either, but still beats sleeping in my car) for an energy drink or anything with caffeine that would give me enough \u201cawake\u201d feeling to get home. And maybe while I\u2019m at it ask if I could borrow a phone to call my spouse. \n\nIt seems that you need to sit down and talk with her about your relationship and why she feels the need to hide the events of that night. She\u2019s misplacing her feelings by blaming you for the cop showing up at her work, which you even tried to stop from happening. You are not wrong to have extreme concern for your wife in this situation. \n\nDo not let her make you feel like ANY of this is normal.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>she doesn\u2019t really have a history of lying to me</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That you know of. I really feel for you and understand that you trust her, which makes you a good partner. This situation though should prove that maybe you shouldn\u2019t trust everything she\u2019s told you in the past. </p>\n\n<p>The reality of this situation is that you don\u2019t know the full story. Her details do not add up. Falling asleep in a car for 5+ hours is unheard of. Even if you prepare to sleep in your car. It is extremely uncomfortable and usually after 2 hours, you\u2019d eventually want to just get home to a bed at that point or find a place to park overnight and call a cab. There were so many obvious solutions this situation led to that she didn\u2019t think about in her story. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the new phone not working? What you describe is what happens when someone\u2019s phone is OFF. If the new phone wasn\u2019t working it wouldn\u2019t have just happened suddenly like that. I\u2019m going to pose a few more questions to make you see how poorly thought through this lie is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she text/call you that she was tired before stopping to sleep in her car? Did she sound tired on your 10:15 PM call?</p></li>\n<li><p>Why wouldn\u2019t the cops have found her? The cops know about those deserted places where people sleep in cars. In my experience, they just don\u2019t care usually unless they need to meet quotas. Sleeping in your car on the side of a road is technically illegal, so it\u2019s really unlikely she accomplished this without being seen, especially since police were already looking for her. Not to mention that the cops definitely knew that her sleeping in her car was a possibility.</p></li>\n<li><p>Why would she just stop for a nap knowing her phone isn\u2019t working?
