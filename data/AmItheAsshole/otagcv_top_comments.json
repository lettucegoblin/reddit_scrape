There are two problematic things with Sean's behavior (and by extension, your wife's insufficient response):\n\n1) If Sean threw such a tantrum about being required to take a video down, it sounds like he does not understand or comply with the concept of consent in a digital world. Spraying someone who is sleeping as a prank IS an asshole move, yes. But to me the bigger violation is having a video of you in a vulnerable position shared online without your consent. Unless you are in a public space where you cannot expect privacy, a request to take down unapproved content with you in it should always be met with immediate acceptance. It's good that he took it down, but responding with retaliation shows he doesn't understand or respect the need for consent. What happens when he is angry at an partner or ex and has their nudes or sex video - would revenge porn be considered an acceptable thing because he didn't get what he wanted? \n\n2) His retaliation went way beyond a prank. Either he doesn't understand or doesn't care about the time and expense that goes into building a healthy plant community. As someone who (accidently) kills plants on the regular, I would be heartbroken if someone deliberately killed the few I have managed to get to thrive. \n\nI agree that an apology is insufficient in this case. His actions had very real world consequences to your plants and he should understand those consequences better. His mom isn't doing him any favors by having him think that insincere apologies \"fix\" everything - if anything, it is way better to learn about consequences when you are in a safe space and not out in the world or at your job. I also don't know that canceling the trip gets him to understand and/or repent, though. Perhaps it is time to think through your goals and have a sit down discussion with him about what restitution would look like for you. Maybe it would be him paying for plant replacements? Or paying for the plants and working on them together so that he understands what goes into actually keeping plants alive (it's still a mystery to me - thank god for pothos)? Or him volunteering for community landscaping project? Or him taking a class on online consent? He can't bring your plants back, but what restitution would actually make you feel better?",

It might not rescue all of them, but there's a good chance you can save some.  Personally, I would suggest:\n\n* Remove everything from the pots.  Discard soil, thoroughly rinse the roots and pots, and replant with fresh soil.\n\n* If the roots look damaged or things start to wilt, you can take cuttings and start over.  I do a lot of propagation and I'm happy to give advice if you want it.\n\n* Look at local nursery prices or online prices for plants.  Keep a log of anything that dies or is damaged.  As I'm sure you know, some houseplants can get very expensive.  If your family keeps complaining, give them an invoice.",

When I asked why she picked all the unripe tomatoes, she said it was to save the seeds for me from the dying plant. My husband saw a sheet of red when I came inside, sobbing and hyperventilating. I have never heard him get as angry as he did that day.

She is almost 50 (we are in our 30's) and she cannot keep her hands to herself, can't control her mouth, doesn't understand that other people's shit isn't her property, she buys plants, fish, hermit crabs, etc and allows them to die because she neglects them, still gets nailed for DUI's, etc. I spent 20 minutes this morning cleaning shattered glass off of our sidewalk because she got drunk with her bf last night and i guess smashing bottles where kids and animals walk is fun?
