        "body": "OP, you did the right thing. I\u2019m so glad you did it for your brother\u2019s partner, yourself, and your brother. \n\nIn my experience, this post I read years ago by u/Gsnow is pretty accurate about how grief flows over time:\n\n\u201cAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\u201d",

I don&#39;t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don&#39;t want it to &quot;not matter&quot;. I don&#39;t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can&#39;t see.</p>\n\n<p>As for grief, you&#39;ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you&#39;re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it&#39;s some physical thing. Maybe it&#39;s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it&#39;s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don&#39;t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you&#39;ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what&#39;s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere down the line, and it&#39;s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O&#39;Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you&#39;ll come out.</p>\n\n<p>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don&#39;t really want them to. But you learn that you&#39;ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you&#39;ll survive them too. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

I hope the world grows to have more people like you who are accepting and loving even when they are struggling themselves. \n\nI think you did the best thing you could have for both your brother and M. I know the fear that comes with being lgbt+ and in a relationship while having ignorant family members, and seeing the way you reacted made me feel a little more safe taking a step out into the world every day. The way that you listened to M and welcomed him with loving arms is honestly making me cry as I think about it because reading what you said just made me feel so safe. \n\nYou\u2019re a great dad, too. Grief is all-consuming, but the fact that you recognized your daughters reaction and decided to get help for yourself (and your family) makes me incredibly proud of you. Not only are you making the best choice for yourself in getting help, but you are also showing your daughter how to do so if, God forbid, she ever has her own struggles. Learning to take proper care of myself when things get tough is one of the lessons I wish I was taught growing up. I know the feeling of nausea that comes with your body when you try to eat when you have no desire to, and I am so proud of you for pushing through that for your daughter and your own healing. I hope that I will have an influence like yours when I have children and the  going gets tough.\n\nLosing someone you love is one of the worst feelings in the world, and it is so easy to get trapped in that grief. However, I believe you have made the best of a horrible situation in bonding with M, being honest about your pain, and getting help. You are so incredibly strong, and I admire you so so much even though we have never met. Please take care of yourself, OP. \n\nThank you so much for posting about this. You have made so many people around the world, including myself, feel safer in being who they are. You also make me feel reassured that the next generation of kiddos to come will have the same love that you do. I cannot thank you enough for how you have treated M and the entire situation. \n\nI hope you heal well, OP. You have a strong and beautiful heart, and I hope to make the same impact you made on me on the world some day. \n\nMay your brother rest peacefully. \n\nTake care of yourself. I will not forget your story and the overwhelming love and safety that you made me feel. Stay safe, OP.",

She will never forget seeing her dad be willing to be vulnerable, and it will set a great example for her of how the most important man in her life expresses and processes his emotions in a healthy way. </p>\n\n<p>Godspeed OP, I wish you, M, and your family peace and healing \u2764\ufe0f.</p>\n</div>",

Obviously hiding our outward expression of emotions is usually not healthy and I'd never recommend it, but with kids there's additional factors at play. I've had to hide my hurt or at least try and make it less severe to protect my daughter from the worst. Of course this i coupled with also acknowledging it and talking about it with her in an age appropriate manner. I don't think hiding it completely or saying nothing is wrong is correct either.
