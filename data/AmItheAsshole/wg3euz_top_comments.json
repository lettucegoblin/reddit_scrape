His friend his good enough to buy a first class ticket for, but not his wife? And she's entitled?!?!?! Acting like royalty to want the same as he bought for himself?

He's the first to say it's our money, and this is the arrangement we decided on for the benefit of our family (and, frankly, his career). If we were going on a flight, he'd never book me for something less than he gets. As a matter of fact, I could see him putting me first class and sitting in coach because he wanted to spoil me a little (reality is that we both would rather spend our money on other things, so unless it was a really long flight, we're both sucking it up in coach).\n\nOP, you're NTA. Your husband doesn't respect or value you... at least, not in the way you deserve. He cares more for his friend's comfort than yours. Sadly, that says a lot about your marriage. Please, proceed carefully and, at the very least, get some counseling.",
