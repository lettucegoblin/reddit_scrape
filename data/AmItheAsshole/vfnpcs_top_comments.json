If someone doesn\u2019t understand something, that doesn\u2019t give them a right to be hateful.

Duncan had no right to treat you and your dads with such hostility and hide behind his religion, especially when your dads existence does nothing to harm him at all. Way I see it, if Duncan wanted to learn and be understanding, he should\u2019ve done the bare minimum of recognizing that LGBTQ people exist and respecting them as individuals. He could\u2019ve easily, easily, kept his homophobia to himself, but now it\u2019s out there and he has to deal with the consequences of treating someone rudely because he had hate in his heart. And I hope that you put on another show, because as far as he and your teacher know, that was real sadness at how he treated your dads, and that sadness shouldn\u2019t be ignored just because he\u2019s gonna get a permanent mark. He was being a bully, bully\u2019s don\u2019t deserve good records.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nFor a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). \n\nI\u2019m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I\u2019m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I\u2019ll call Duncan (15m) found out. \n\nDuncan started simple with jokes like \u201cwow which one of them is the mom?\u201d Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient\u201d. \n\nDuncan started to escalate with \u201cEnjoy your time here, it\u2019ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell\u201d and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was \u201cYou can\u2019t be prejudiced with his religion, it\u2019s wrong in the Bible. He\u2019s us just trying to understand.\u201d\n\nIn my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn\u2019t go to another btw. \n\nI have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. \n\nSo when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mudadas\u2019 Death. The Fox and The Hound. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. \n\nThe scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. \n\nWhen we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy\u2019s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.\u201d He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. \n\nThen later Duncan\u2019s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I\u2019ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I\u2019ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m wrong, but with Mr.Smith\u2019s warning and Duncan\u2019s friends I\u2019m starting to doubt , so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m 18 but god I did not expect just how excited I would get to see a similar situation. \n\nNow that\u2019s out the way lol, I just want to say, never fucking feel sorry for sticking up for your family. If your parents are anything like mine, they have tried with all their might to make your life as free of that type of shit as they possibly can. School is where their power ends unfortunately, but that means you go into school and you do not tolerate it for a second. I\u2019ve heard all those things, and my entire life I\u2019ve told them to shut up. \n\nDuncan was way out of line, your teacher was a massive asshole and completely failed at their job, and the principal did exactly what she needed to do. Duncan did what he did. How you got him exposed honestly doesn\u2019t matter, he chose to say those nasty things to you, and it\u2019s good he finally got his punishment. You haven\u2019t ruined his record, he did. Do not listen to any of Duncan\u2019s friends or Mr Smith, I promise they\u2019re wrong and not speaking from a place of respect for our types of families. \n\nAlso, I suggest you do talk to your dads about it. They would most likely love to hear it and would support you. They know the realities of the world, you don\u2019t need to protect them from it.

Good people will side with you, making you not feel so lonely. Who knows, maybe he bullied others too? \n\nAlso, please tell your dads. One of my biggest regrets growing up was not sharing stuff with my dad to \u201cprotect him\u201d. I think this ultimately pushed us apart, since I hid many of my problems from him and began isolating myself. This led to serious depression in my teens, which resulted in my dad having to take me to a psychologist and psychiatrist.

One of the biggest lies ever told is that your \"permanent record\" at school matters.  It ceases to mean anything the second you leave that school.  Colleges don't ask for it when you apply.  Jobs certainly don't.  This kid is going to be just fine.  \n\nYour teacher, however, needs to have his life ruined a little bit.  Because his employment file does matter.  I agree with the above posts that say you need to get yourself transferred into a different class.  He's absolutely going to take this out on you.  He has no business teaching children.",

Those students, if they keep Kosher/Halal/follow hindu eating habits, have to either bring their lunch or decide to choose options that don't contain food they are forbidden by their religion from eating, and as a result, that may limit their choices.  They aren't going to be able to have a chicken sandwich with cheese on it, or a soup made with pork broth, or baked beans with bacon in them, but they don't get to tell every other student in the school that they are going to burn in hell or reincarnate as a spider for eating a cheeseburger.  That's what religious freedom is. \n\nMany, many christians in the US think religious freedom means wahhh no one else can be happy if they're not in my club I'm gonna whine about it and make them join my club whether they like it or not, because I can't deal with people making choices that are different than mine.",

He\u2019d say I was blowing things out of proportion, and if I really thought I was being abused, I would have left him. So I eventually filed for divorce. He was shocked, and kept saying it wasn\u2019t fair for me to leave him without having more of a discussion, and that he was blindsided and hadn\u2019t known I was so unhappy, etc. It seems there\u2019s a certain segment of the population that thinks women only express distress in order to unfairly manipulate situations.",
