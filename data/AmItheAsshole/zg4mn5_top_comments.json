The fish was snapper, which I don't like, and was stated as being marinated in bourbon sauce prior to cooking, and the chicken glazed with a bourbon sauce. I can't stand even the smallest hints of bourbon or its smell.\n\nFeels like there's a non-fried chicken dish right there. Tell them to leave off the bourbon sauce glaze. \n\n>Half the sides had bacon in them so those were out. One salad had peppered steak in it, their other salad option said they were temporarily out because they didn't have the mandarins, grapes, and cranberries for it.\n\nTell them not to put bacon on the sides you want or leave the steak off that salad. \n\nI definitely agree that there were things OP *could* eat, just nothing that she *wanted*. So yes, YTA. You're not paying so suck it up for one celebration dinner and eat something that's just okay.",
