Her reaction to being caught is textbook. She\u2019s not upset that she got glitter all over herself, despite appearances. She knows she got caught so she made a scene so she could get away with it. Usually people who get caught feel guilty and ashamed. So to confuse you and cause distress amongst you (clearly it\u2019s working) she huffed about it and I\u2019m guessing your husband\u2019s usual dynamic in his family was to defend his mother while his sister called her out and the father stayed uninvolved out of fear of MIL. Really dysfunctional and unhealthy to let someone act this way unchecked. Likely she\u2019s conditioned everyone to accepting her problematic behavior by throwing tantrums or making scenes that make everyone so uncomfortable that they eventually stop trying to hold her accountable. To her benefit.\n\nIt\u2019s really gone far enough in my opinion that husband needs therapy if he wants to stay with you. He needs to ask himself why he\u2019s so uncomfortable holding your mother accountable for her actions like an adult and when did he start defending her blindly to \u201ckeep the peace?\u201d.\n\nThe moment you brought up the issue, he should\u2019ve been supporting you 100% and on your side. Setting clear and firm boundaries with MIL and your space and respecting your privacy. You and your kids are his family now first. His first responsibility. You can\u2019t protect your space and privacy while fighting your husband. You\u2019re supposed to be on the same team. But he dismissed you without taking you seriously from the start. He needs to consider his priorities in relationships and who he\u2019s willing to defend more. Because this is not your problem to deal with. And you don\u2019t need this while raising a baby. You deserve better and shouldn\u2019t settle for less than a supportive open and self accountable partner.\n\nIt\u2019s his job to see how this effects you and care about you enough to stop it happening anymore. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this but I think it\u2019s time you asked yourself, why are you defending your husbands actions the same way he defends your MIL? Why are you accepting less than you deserve? For the sake of keeping the relationship? For your kids? Because you feel obligated after all this time? None of those are good answers to deal with and put up with toxic people.\n\nAsk yourself if you\u2019re okay with MIL invading your kid\u2019s private spaces and items when they\u2019re older because she is not changing, that much I\u2019m sure of. If you don\u2019t set boundaries now, your kids will pay for it as well as you.\n\nNTA",

Likely she\u2019s conditioned everyone to accepting her problematic behavior by throwing tantrums or making scenes that make everyone so uncomfortable that they eventually stop trying to hold her accountable. To her benefit.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s really gone far enough in my opinion that husband needs therapy if he wants to stay with you. He needs to ask himself why he\u2019s so uncomfortable holding your mother accountable for her actions like an adult and when did he start defending her blindly to \u201ckeep the peace?\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The moment you brought up the issue, he should\u2019ve been supporting you 100% and on your side. Setting clear and firm boundaries with MIL and your space and respecting your privacy. You and your kids are his family now first. His first responsibility. You can\u2019t protect your space and privacy while fighting your husband. You\u2019re supposed to be on the same team. But he dismissed you without taking you seriously from the start. He needs to consider his priorities in relationships and who he\u2019s willing to defend more. Because this is not your problem to deal with. And you don\u2019t need this while raising a baby. You deserve better and shouldn\u2019t settle for less than a supportive open and self accountable partner.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s his job to see how this effects you and care about you enough to stop it happening anymore. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this but I think it\u2019s time you asked yourself, why are you defending your husbands actions the same way he defends your MIL? Why are you accepting less than you deserve? For the sake of keeping the relationship? For your kids? Because you feel obligated after all this time? None of those are good answers to deal with and put up with toxic people.</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself if you\u2019re okay with MIL invading your kid\u2019s private spaces and items when they\u2019re older because she is not changing, that much I\u2019m sure of. If you don\u2019t set boundaries now, your kids will pay for it as well as you.</p>\n\n<p>NTA</p>\n</div>",

She got *very* angry with me a few years ago, when I politely told her, on the phone, that I am her son, and I don\u2019t want to hear *that much* about her relationships with men, because it made me uncomfortable. \n\nShe never said anything gross, thank god. But I told her that I\u2019m not her girlfriend, and she needs to talk to her friends about this kind of stuff, not me. She\u2019d been treating me as a peer, as one of her friends, since I was 16 years old. The only time she went into \u201cthat\u2019s my son!\u201d mode was when I was in Iraq, and part of me knows she did that to garner praise as well as sympathy from other people. \u201c*My SON is over THERE!*\u201d type shit. \n\nIf she was simply telling me that she was dating a new guy, he\u2019s nice, he does this, etc I\u2019d have been fine. But having to sit on the phone for 45 minutes over and over, not being able to get a word in, because some guy she likes said something she thinks is rude, and every granular detail of the situation MUST be discussed? Nope. I\u2019m out. \n\nIt didn\u2019t help that just a few months prior to this, I had left a surgeons office one morning, got in my car, and called her to tell her that I had just scheduled spinal fusion surgery in my neck, three weeks from that day.  \n\nWithin 20 seconds, she had turned the conversation around to her (she\u2019s a master at this) and how she \u201cmight\u201d have a brain tumor, that she \u201cmight\u201d need to get an MRI, and if it\u2019s bad, she \u201cmight\u201d need surgery. Oh, what was she going to do if she had to have surgery \u2014 and she might even die!\n\nThis was, of course, total bullshit. She never got the MRI \u2014 she never even scheduled it \u2014 and she didn\u2019t/does not have a brain tumor. I have no clue why she assumed she \u201cmight\u201d have one. She maybe brought it up once or twice more and then never spoke of it again. (Last month, she was all up in arms, saying that there is something wrong with her eye, and she might go blind. This month? Poof, that\u2019s gone, too!)\n\nBut: you know who did get an MRI \u2014 a month before I called her that morning \u2014 and who did need, and had surgery? Me. No mights. All definites. Three weeks later, I went under, and a surgeon cut open the front of my neck open, pushed all the stuff to the sides, and inserted more titanium in my spine. Then two weeks later COVID became FUCKING COVID, and I was left to recover from surgery on my own. \n\n(*Not complaining. Life\u2019s tough. I survived. But it would have been a lot easier with a support system in place.*)\n\nSo anyway, I told her all this stuff, she got *so offended*, and said something like, \u201cfine, then I won\u2019t tell you ANYTHING anymore!\u201d Not \u201cI\u2019ll stop talking about things that make you uncomfortable\u201d  \u2014 she just won\u2019t tell me ANYTHING anymore.

Basically you gotta screen the therapist to make sure they don't have a \"unicorn\" for family ties that make it hard for them to see toxic behavior like this clearly. The last thing you need is a counselor telling you to be a flatter doormat because \"that's just how MIL is\". The answer is for your H to side with you and set boundaries and consequences for her toxic behavior. So you have to screen appropriately as a \"unicorn\" therapist could do a lot of damage on your marriage.",

Then, my mother met a guy back in her old hometown and got pregnant, so she pulled me out of kindergarten (I never actually graduated kindergarten! Don\u2019t tell anyone though, they might take my college degree away, lol) and we moved back to this small town, and into a rented house with her new BF. \n\nHe was physically abusive for almost a year, as well as psychologically. Not going to get into the physical stuff, but the first day I met him, he informed me that I had to call him Dad from now on. I\u2019d just met the fucking guy ten minutes earlier. It was weird, and things only got worse as time went on. \n\n(One time, his dog attacked a rabbit and messed it up *really* bad. Like, it was half alive. To put the rabbit out of it\u2019s misery, my moms bf shot the rabbit. No wait, that\u2019s not true. He cut the rabbits throat. No, that\u2019s a lie too. What he did was fill the kitchen sink up with water, and *drowned the rabbit to death,* and made me watch. I\u2019d forgotten about this until recently, and I\u2019m still in awe of how fucking sick it was. That\u2019s not putting something out of it\u2019s misery \u2014 that\u2019s causing it one of the worst imaginable types of misery before it died. Fucking sicko.)\n\nAbout a year into living with this guy, everyone close to us \u2014 family, friends \u2014 kind of collectively made a stand and got me out of there, and I went to live with my grandparents. I was very close with them. Very. They adored me, and it was mutual. But, I didn\u2019t know I was going to live with them. \n\nOn the last day of school, I got off the bus at their place, seemingly to spend the weekend there. I got in my grandpas truck. My grandma was there, too. I asked them how long I was staying. One of them \u2014 I don\u2019t remember which \u2014 replied, \u201cyou\u2019re going to live with us from now on.\u201d \n\nIt was the happiest day of my life. \n\nStill brainwashed a bit from my mothers bf, I called up to their house to tell them about my report card \u2014 straight As. He answered the phone. I told him about my grades, and I called him Dad. And he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s great. But don\u2019t ever call me Dad again,\u201d and hung up. Talk about fucking with a kids head\u2026\n\nYears later, he went on trial, accused of murdering a woman he was dating before my mother, but he was acquitted when the only witness gave conflicting testimony, and was considered unreliable (he was a drunk). My younger brother, his son, stopped talking to him years ago. Decades later, I still \u2014 occasionally \u2014 fantasize about beating the shit out of him, lol. \n\nBut: if you\u2019d ask my mom now about what happened back then, she\u2019d say: that\u2019s crazy, I (me) graduated Kindergarten! That I\u2019m not remembering things how they really happened! And that she wasn\u2019t aware of what her ex was doing \u2014 not until the end! And that I went to live with my grandparents because they begged her to let me live there because they loved me. If you asked her why she stayed with him for nearly four years after I moved in with my grandparents, instead of leaving him, getting her own place, or even moving in with my grandparents, she\u2019d tell you that she had to finish college first (because the only place you can live while you finish college is with an abusive BF). Or that she was scared of him. Or because of their child. It depends on the day you ask. Then she\u2019d tell you to stop attacking her. \n\nSorry for the rant. I haven\u2019t written this out ever, and it feels good to do so. Real good.\n\nThank you for the gentle nudge, even if unintentionally : )",

When we carry trauma, it's an enormous burden to us, so we hesitate to share it with someone else because we don't want to dump this enormous burden on them too. But the burden that feels like 200lbs only feels like that to you! When you share it with someone else and it's not their trauma, many times it only feels like 5lbs to them. So sharing your story/trauma/burden can massively unburden you, giving you more space inside you to just be you and not your trauma, without negatively effecting the people you shared it with.\n\nYou just unburdened yourself to hundreds of people, and now a lot of that weight has been lifted from you, and all of us who read it are now carrying a teaspoon of it for you, so you don't have to anymore, but it doesn't feel like anything heavy to us! You also showed other people how helpful unburdening can be, so they'll be more likely to do that too, slowly healing their trauma as well.\n\nYou'll never know how far that chain goes, just know that you made a positive impact on people's lives by sharing your story...so don't be afraid to keep doing so. If you ever get a negative response to sharing, just remember that's a personal problem on the receiver's end because they haven't gotten to the point that they can share...and keep sharing.",
