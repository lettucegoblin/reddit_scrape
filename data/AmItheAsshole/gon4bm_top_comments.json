        "body": "Alright guys so my boyfriend and I just had a very long conversation. I admitted to him that I vented on Reddit and I screen shotted a bunch of comments for him to read through. He was mostly silent for awhile and got a little emotional. Eventually he asked me if I showed him all these comments because I was planning on leaving him. I told him no, I wasn't going to just dump him without giving him the chance to work through our issues if he was willing to. I explained to him that I understand his past trauma with his mother, but it doesn't make it okay for him to enable her to be abusive towards me. He agreed that he was in the wrong and he should have made a bigger effort to step in and defend me. He also apologized for asking me to call his mother and apologize. I told him that I wasn't going to make him choose between me and his mother, but if we were going to have a healthy relationship he would have to start going to therapy and he would have to confront his mother about her behavior. I told him I would stand by him and support him as he did it, but it was something he would have to do on his own. I told him that we were setting some hard boundaries and one of those boundaries would be that his parents are no longer allowed to stay with us. Ever. He agreed that was for the best and admitted he's been miserable these past two months too. He mentioned that cutting off his family might be what is healthiest for his mental health and how that is something he would discuss with the psychiatrist when he goes. I told him that I was extremely hurt that not only was he willing to prioritize his mother over me, but he was willing to cause me pain to satiate her need for control. It bothered me a lot that he made me really feel like I WAS THE ASSHOLE to the point that I made this post to try to gain perspective. After that he told me he would call his mother and request she apologize for treating me so poorly the past two months. Honestly that is a REALLY big step for him and I am very proud of him for that. It shows me that he is willing to work on his issues. I do think seeing a professional might help him process these emotions better and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Overall, right now it seems like we're going to be okay relationship wise as long as he is committed to actually following through with his promises. Thank you to everyone who commented!! You have been extremely helpful. I will keep you guys updates on any new developments.",

If he is spineless when it comes to the parents then are you going to put with their demands for the rest of your life? If you force him to cut off his parents then he may just resent you for it.

If he won&#39;t defend you to his parents, I&#39;m begging you to not be me and to sit down with that boy and tell him that if he doesn&#39;t start treating you better you&#39;ll leave his ass. You&#39;re absolutely in the right here and as much as you love the guy, you deserve way better than some guy who can&#39;t stand up to his parents.</p>\n</div>",

For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. \n\nOut of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said \"Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work\". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. \n\nI go into the guest room and say \"Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house.\" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, \"You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before.\" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. \n\nNow my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me. If Reddit determines I am the asshole, I will call and apologize.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So after that I guess she realized I wasn&#39;t going to budge and they just started packing. </p>\n\n<p>As far as him wanting me to apologize, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s him thinking their behavior is okay as much as him just wanting to be passive and keep the peace. Standing up to his parents makes him incredibly anxious and brings back a lot of childhood trauma I guess. So he just wants this ordeal to be over and done with so he can stop stressing about it.</p>\n</div>",

Relationships take work, we all have baggage we don't realize, learning skills like self-advocacy and setting boundaries and sticking to them are not a given, and it's not his fault he hasn't yet learned or realized that his relationship with his parents is toxic and since he's no longer a child, but an adult, that he has the right to advocate for his needs and set boundaries. (Children have this right too! It's just much harder when you don't have any options or recourse of getting out of that environment).\n\n\nIf he is an amazing partner with everything except his boundaries with his parents (and him assuming you should have the same poor lack of boundaries with them), let him know that it's a deal breaker for you and give him the chance to work on, learn, and implement those boundaries. Maybe you could even help him figure out how to even begin communicating them (it's not on you to do that though, he should see a licensed professional therapist for this help).\n\n\nSounds like he has no idea how to stand up to them, and that he doesn't realize that he's even deserving of having his own wants and needs and that they're no less valid or deserving of respect than those of his parents. Just because they've gotten away with that kind of bullying his whole life does not mean that he needs to keep accepting it.\n\n\nStep 1 though, is seeing if he even recognizes how big of a problem his lack of boundaries with them and lack standing up for himself and you is, and that it's very likely to cause him to lose his relationship with you, which I'm sure he doesn't want. If you make it clear that this is non-negotiable for you and if he wants you in his life, then he'll realize that he needs to deal with this dynamic and be open to and start doing the work.\n\n\nIf he see no issue, and isn't even open to trying and changing at the cost of losing you, then there's your answer.\n\n\nGood luck OP!!
