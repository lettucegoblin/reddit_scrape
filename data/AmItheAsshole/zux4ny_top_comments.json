It's extremely stupid to demand that someone stay at your home but then limit your freedoms as adults who don't need to willingly give up their freedoms.\n2. This idiocy around religious holidays is toxic\n\nYes, you can have a rule that others can't do certain things in their house. No, you don't get to call others assholes for not wanting to stay somewhere that forces a separation of intimacy between couples who are each others' number one. The most important thing my wife and I do is to always wake together, and end our day together, to be by each others' side. If someone wants to intrude on that, then we simply won't be there.\n\nI grew up in an abusive christian cult where I was beaten daily, and my family also had this rule regarding significant others too. Years later after therapy and growing up, I decided to stop going to my family's place for christmas. My mother completely lost it, blowing up at me and insulting me for daring to wish to spend christmas alone with my wife who loves christmas and wanted to celebrate it in a secular way for once, disowning me over a stupid fucking holiday. She was manipulative and demanded I come as it was my familial duty, that if I didn't come I was sinful for disrespecting parents. She cried for hours and screamed. Anyway, I've since cut off most contact.\n\nI can 100% understand the hesitancy in speaking about a difficult topic like limiting contact or not going to a family home because religious nutjob parents will just fucking explode at you and nobody wants to deal with that, so you just let it sit quietly without letting them know. That doesn't make you an asshole, that makes \\*them\\* the asshole for being shitty people who care about stupid things and making big deals out of it when people are just trying to live and enjoy their own lives the way they want.\n\nFuck controlling religious parents. You are NOT the butthole, and jesus christ so many redditors are brainwashed christians.",

Although you handled the online well, you acted pettily in other parts.\n\nA boundary is only a boundary if you show resistance when pushed against. You initially displayed that boundary (of privacy) when last year you guys booked that hotel. To stand your ground this year, the adult behaviour would have been to tell them that you stand by your boundary of needing privacy with your bf, but respect their house rules (as ridiculous as it is), so unless they changed their mind re: hotel and will stop bitching at you about it, you will spend it at your bf\u2019s parents\u2019 instead. And if they still bother you about then, you can tell say \u201ci already told you why i am doing this so i am not discussing further\u201d. \n\nThat way you would have drawn the boundary. Not by arguing semantics of a \u201cpromise\u201d when it was obvious you were misleading her. It you want to be treated like an adult, then you have to act like one. Also this just gives her unnecessary ammo now. \n\nI have a manipulative controlling mom. YMMV of course but me being the most direct and blunt and forceful works the best. I might have to hear a bit of gaslighting and whining for a bit, but it avoids the explosiveness that comes with after if i had mislead her. I rather handle few weeks of drama than few years.",

To stand your ground this year, the adult behaviour would have been to tell them that you stand by your boundary of needing privacy with your bf, but respect their house rules (as ridiculous as it is), so unless they changed their mind re: hotel and will stop bitching at you about it, you will spend it at your bf\u2019s parents\u2019 instead. And if they still bother you about then, you can tell say \u201ci already told you why i am doing this so i am not discussing further\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>That way you would have drawn the boundary. Not by arguing semantics of a \u201cpromise\u201d when it was obvious you were misleading her. It you want to be treated like an adult, then you have to act like one. Also this just gives her unnecessary ammo now. </p>\n\n<p>I have a manipulative controlling mom. YMMV of course but me being the most direct and blunt and forceful works the best. I might have to hear a bit of gaslighting and whining for a bit, but it avoids the explosiveness that comes with after if i had mislead her. I rather handle few weeks of drama than few years.</p>\n</div>",

You mother assumed you would spend Christmas with the family, didn't bother asking, and made you promise not to stay in a hotel over Christmas because in her eyes it's wrong to share a room when unwed. You did not lie, as the subject of where you were spending the holiday never came up. Could you have said, \"hey mom, don't set a place for me this year since I'm on my way to Mexico to spend it with my future MIL.\" Sure, but since you've had years of dealing with your mom and her antics, then I'm sure you knew the fallout from that and didn't want to deal with the toxicity of the situation. Does you mom really think you don't share a room with your BF throughout the year?\n\nFunny how normally commentors would recognize the toxic relationship and encourage LC or NC, even going so far as explaining how the OP doesn't need to explain the reasons as it's an ongoing argument.

You mother assumed you would spend Christmas with the family, didn&#39;t bother asking, and made you promise not to stay in a hotel over Christmas because in her eyes it&#39;s wrong to share a room when unwed. You did not lie, as the subject of where you were spending the holiday never came up. Could you have said, &quot;hey mom, don&#39;t set a place for me this year since I&#39;m on my way to Mexico to spend it with my future MIL.&quot; Sure, but since you&#39;ve had years of dealing with your mom and her antics, then I&#39;m sure you knew the fallout from that and didn&#39;t want to deal with the toxicity of the situation. Does you mom really think you don&#39;t share a room with your BF throughout the year?</p>\n\n<p>Funny how normally commentors would recognize the toxic relationship and encourage LC or NC, even going so far as explaining how the OP doesn&#39;t need to explain the reasons as it&#39;s an ongoing argument. Now, some are claiming she&#39;s a brat for not putting herself in the same situation as all the other times - because the behavior of the mother isn&#39;t happening only once a year, and I doubt only for this one thing.</p>\n\n<p>Merry Christmas, enjoy your holiday!</p>\n</div>",

We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. \n\nMy mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  \n\nMy boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  \n\nWe didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  \n\nI am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  \n\nI may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  \n\nThey took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. \n\nNow they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.

First mom said you couldn\u2019t stay in the bed, then she said you couldn\u2019t stay in a hotel. It\u2019s about time she experienced some consequences for her controlling behavior. If she keeps it up, enjoy your wedding without them.</p>\n</div>",

What you did is basically the equivalent of chucking your toys out of the pram when you didn\u2019t get what you wanted.

The only thing that might have changed is OP\u2019s guilt might have been assuaged a little, but probably not entirely, and it likely would\u2019ve been cancelled out anyway bc telling them ahead of time would open up OP to being guilt tripped. This way it\u2019s already done and they don\u2019t have an opportunity to try to pressure her into changing her mind.\n\nWay too many people are buying into the mother\u2019s narcissistic framing of this being a debate where whoever has the most concrete justifications wins, and that if OP followed the \u201ccorrect\u201d steps then she could somehow \u201cwin\u201d this situation. It makes absolutely no difference how OP handled this, unless the OP did exactly what the mother wanted she would\u2019ve always found a way that OP was in the wrong and she was in the right. It\u2019s like how rightwing talking heads are always obsessed with getting people to debate them - they have no interest in actually listening to what you have to say beyond figuring out how they can twist your words to use against you. As soon as you engage you\u2019ve already lost.

The only thing that might have changed is OP\u2019s guilt might have been assuaged a little, but probably not entirely, and it likely would\u2019ve been cancelled out anyway bc telling them ahead of time would open up OP to being guilt tripped. This way it\u2019s already done and they don\u2019t have an opportunity to try to pressure her into changing her mind.</p>\n\n<p>Way too many people are buying into the mother\u2019s narcissistic framing of this being a debate where whoever has the most concrete justifications wins, and that if OP followed the \u201ccorrect\u201d steps then she could somehow \u201cwin\u201d this situation. It makes absolutely no difference how OP handled this, unless the OP did exactly what the mother wanted she would\u2019ve always found a way that OP was in the wrong and she was in the right. It\u2019s like how rightwing talking heads are always obsessed with getting people to debate them - they have no interest in actually listening to what you have to say beyond figuring out how they can twist your words to use against you. As soon as you engage you\u2019ve already lost. The most you can gain is checking the box that says \u201cI did the thing society says I\u2019m supposed to do in order to be the bigger person.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "My parents are like OP's. I'm also older than OP and have dealt with this style of BS for longer. \n\nAll OP did was kick the can down the road. \n\nThey changed the topic and gave the mother ammunition. It's a temporary \"win\" that exists solely to make yourself feel better without addressing any underlying issues nor making progress towards an actual solution. \n\nWith parents like that, unless you're going no-contact, it just makes the situation worse. Plus the parents have likely drilled a sense of guilt and obligation into their children, so OP is likely to beat themselves up over their decision sooner or later. \n\nPlaying childish games like lying by omission undercuts your understandable and \"just\" position. The position that is, to not be treated like a child and harangued, browbeaten into submission. (OP's hotel option was perfectly reasonable, their mother's reaction was an overbearing and controlling response.)\n\nThe best way OP should have handled their Christmas plans, imo, is stating their intentions to their mother. \n\nThis is *absolutely* easier said than done, I know. But I've experienced the alternatives and most end up worse in the long run. \n\nIf OP didn't want to deal with the drama that stating their intentions would bring at Thanksgiving (I would do the same at that point to keep the peace), they should have called a week or so later. \n\nIt would cause drama, there may be yelling and guilt tripping. \n\nWhen faced with that type behavior however, you need to keep your cool and put on your stone face (sometimes called gray-face). Not \"cold\" face, but stone-like, resolute, stating facts and not reacting emotionally. You cannot respond to their prodding and bait. It's like acting wounded in front of a hungry predator. \n\nYou tell them your intentions and boundaries; depending on how the conversation goes exactly. You tell them that you don't appreciate their behavior, it goes against so-and-so that you discussed or that you \"understand\" their feedback but you will be doing this or that instead. \n\nIf they push back harder, you tell them you can speak later when they've had time to process the conversation but you have things to do. I would end the conversation there. They'll likely say something hurtful at that point; it's in their nature to lash out when they don't get their way. Don't be drawn into it and conclude the convo.\n\n(IMO You cannot give an inch, but if you act like a \"jagged rock\" it's too tempting to act vindictive in your responses plus you can burn bridges you may not want burned.)\n\nThis has been my most successful tactic with dealing with narcissistic parents.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My parents are like OP&#39;s. I&#39;m also older than OP and have dealt with this style of BS for longer. </p>\n\n<p>All OP did was kick the can down the road. </p>\n\n<p>They changed the topic and gave the mother ammunition. It&#39;s a temporary &quot;win&quot; that exists solely to make yourself feel better without addressing any underlying issues nor making progress towards an actual solution. </p>\n\n<p>With parents like that, unless you&#39;re going no-contact, it just makes the situation worse. Plus the parents have likely drilled a sense of guilt and obligation into their children, so OP is likely to beat themselves up over their decision sooner or later. </p>\n\n<p>Playing childish games like lying by omission undercuts your understandable and &quot;just&quot; position. The position that is, to not be treated like a child and harangued, browbeaten into submission. (OP&#39;s hotel option was perfectly reasonable, their mother&#39;s reaction was an overbearing and controlling response.)</p>\n\n<p>The best way OP should have handled their Christmas plans, imo, is stating their intentions to their mother. </p>\n\n<p>This is <em>absolutely</em> easier said than done, I know. But I&#39;ve experienced the alternatives and most end up worse in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>If OP didn&#39;t want to deal with the drama that stating their intentions would bring at Thanksgiving (I would do the same at that point to keep the peace), they should have called a week or so later. </p>\n\n<p>It would cause drama, there may be yelling and guilt tripping. </p>\n\n<p>When faced with that type behavior however, you need to keep your cool and put on your stone face (sometimes called gray-face). Not &quot;cold&quot; face, but stone-like, resolute, stating facts and not reacting emotionally. You cannot respond to their prodding and bait. It&#39;s like acting wounded in front of a hungry predator. </p>\n\n<p>You tell them your intentions and boundaries; depending on how the conversation goes exactly. You tell them that you don&#39;t appreciate their behavior, it goes against so-and-so that you discussed or that you &quot;understand&quot; their feedback but you will be doing this or that instead. </p>\n\n<p>If they push back harder, you tell them you can speak later when they&#39;ve had time to process the conversation but you have things to do. I would end the conversation there. They&#39;ll likely say something hurtful at that point; it&#39;s in their nature to lash out when they don&#39;t get their way. Don&#39;t be drawn into it and conclude the convo.</p>\n\n<p>(IMO You cannot give an inch, but if you act like a &quot;jagged rock&quot; it&#39;s too tempting to act vindictive in your responses plus you can burn bridges you may not want burned.)</p>\n\n<p>This has been my most successful tactic with dealing with narcissistic parents. You state, you <em>sometimes</em> concede extremely slightly on non-important topics to appeal to their ego and smooth things over, but above all, you <em>do not</em> take anything in and let it affect you. </p>\n\n<p>With the way OP played it, I&#39;m concerned about what&#39;s to come.</p>\n\n<p>And may <em>continue</em> coming for <strong><em>years</em></strong>. Narcissists love this kind of ammo. This could potentially crop up repeatedly in the coming <em>decades</em> now.)</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t blame OP for their reaction. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the knee-jerk reaction of someone on the emotionally younger side trying to find the path of least resistance and heartache. <em>I&#39;ve been there</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say ESH but OP is at like a 3-4 out of 10 with their mom at a 8. At least double the suckage. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">But hey, at least she didn&#39;t call the cops or hunt around town in her car. I&#39;ve seen that personally.</span></p>\n</div>",

That genuinely is not needed or helpful even if someone did get into an accident. Have one adult go into another room and call the hospitals between aunts place and whoever was hosting. If no one matching her description is at any of them, call the police stations between their pace and the hosts to see if she was arrested.

The situation described was that <strong>all the adults</strong> spent <strong>the whole evening</strong> trying to track her down. That genuinely is not needed or helpful even if someone did get into an accident. Have one adult go into another room and call the hospitals between aunts place and whoever was hosting. If no one matching her description is at any of them, call the police stations between their pace and the hosts to see if she was arrested.

There is no level of reason that will ever make them listen. Because they are not reasonable. They are truly and fully unreasonable, by choice. This is the \u201cyou can lead a horse to water but you can not make it drink\u201d. Perfect example. \n\nMy family was like this. They aren\u2019t narcissistic but we do have FLEAS because of a parent growing up with a narcissist. My older brother used to insult me and emotionally attack me constantly. Full on bullying/emotional abuse. Fun times! I tried reasoning with him for over 30 years. Explaining how I felt and experienced it, how it made me feel, how I was hurt by being called fat and lazy and stupid and so on. But you can not reason with unreasonable people. So the result was that I got extra shot for \u201ctaking things out on him\u201d. Clearly if I was hurt it couldn\u2019t possibly be because he just told me how fat and lazy and stupid and ugly and worthless I was. Clearly I had some issues with my partner or a friend or whatever and was taking that out on him instead. Because \u2728logic\u2728! What did work was to stop. Don\u2019t even try being reasonable, the golden rule solved it. \u201cDo unto others as you would want them to do unto you\u201d.

Every time he attacked me during the years I could have struck back and I didn\u2019t. Not because I couldn\u2019t, but because I wouldn\u2019t. Until one day I did. And I made sure that he understood. I knew what I was doing, I knew where I was aiming, I knew exactly the impact I would have and the hurt I\u2019d cause. I intended to. And he stopped immediately! 30 years and he never stopped because he was hurting me. He only stopped because he realised that I could hurt him just as much and worse. Fucking people. I\u2019m very angry with him for that. That he forced me to go against my nature and hurt him back.
