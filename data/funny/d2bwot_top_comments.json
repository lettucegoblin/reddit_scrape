This motherfucker lasted me for years on the first cartridge that came with it (that was like 40% capacity). I bought another cartridge and completed my entire college years with the new one. Then I had to move and get a scanner so I gave that printer to my dad for his business and bought a shit HP multi-function machine on Amazon.\n\nThe thing does it's job. But with every couple of pages the ink gauge drops. The motherfucker is dipping into low ink all the time. I am lucky and get replacement cartridges from my employer on expenses.

        "body": "On the flip side of this: I\u2019ve found that reps generally (being a key word) *do* typically care about my wants/complaints/etc if I treat them like people (novel idea, I know), and understand that THEY did not cause my problem. I think I learned this from working at a gas station in my teenage years, where every other day the price of gas was somehow *my* fault. Or if the car wash broke down, I must\u2019ve been the one who broke it. Like, I totally get revealing your frustration, but you *also* have to understand that the person on the other end is just a person.\n\nWhen I call, I make sure to write down the rep\u2019s name immediately, and I\u2019ll use it occasionally to show respect (and then I have it if someone asks me whom I spoke to later on). If Comcast gave me a better offer than the Verizon rep is giving me, I\u2019ll explain that very politely....NOT in a snarky \u201cwell, **Comcast** is offering me more, so you should **automatically** be offering me more with your tail between your legs\u201d sort of way. It\u2019s always something along the lines of \u201cokay, thanks for that information. I\u2019m gonna need to do some thinking on this, because I\u2019m trying to watch my expenses, and I\u2019ve got a slightly better offer from Comcast...but this is still good to know.\u201d \n\nWhen I\u2019m irritated with service - or being told multiple different things from multiple different people - and I wish to speak to a supervisor, I generally go out of my way to be like \u201chey, I know this isn\u2019t your fault, so I\u2019m not taking it out on you....but I think I\u2019d like to talk to a supervisor. I\u2019ve just been given a lot of contradictory information, and I\u2019d like to speak to someone about that.\u201d And when the supervisor comes on, if the first person was genuinely nice or trying to help, I point that out. \u201cHey, I just spoke to Sarah - and she was great and really trying to help me out, but I felt like I needed to voice [complaint] to a supervisor.\u201d\n\nIt may sound like a lot to unnecessary or even fake politeness when it\u2019s written down like this, but in practice, it\u2019s just basic pleasantry and calmness. I\u2019ve gotten so many better offers this way than a few people I know who do the whole *call and immediately threaten to cancel if I don\u2019t get everything I want* thing. Don\u2019t get me wrong....if you\u2019re getting fucked over, then you should absolutely be honest and upfront about how and why that\u2019s a problem. But in my experience, people typically want to help people who seem like respectful people. I got my original Verizon quote lowered by $35/month (with no price increase, in writing) after a few calls, and I think it\u2019s partially because I didn\u2019t give people a reason to think \u201cwow, fuck this asshole.\u201d Instead, I think I gave them a reason to think \u201cman....this guy has been given 4 different quotes from 4 different people, and he\u2019s still calling back with patience. Even while being stern, he\u2019s not resorting to insults and shouting. How can we fix this?\u201d\n\nTl;dr: If you have a valid grievance, treat it as such - but don\u2019t be rude and think that you\u2019ll get whatever you want just because you state that you\u2019re willing to switch to another provider (which is an empty threat much of the time). \n\nAll of that being said.....I\u2019m guilty of doing what OP did once. Went in to a Verizon wireless store to upgrade my phone, and I didn\u2019t want to go through the usual rigmarole of \u201cyou should really buy our insurance - OH, you don\u2019t want a case RIGHT NOW from OUR STORE?? - oh, do you know that most people are using [this service] now??!\u201d I was in a rush on the night of one of my upgrades, and I was basically like \u201chey man...all due respect, but I\u2019m kind of in a rush, and I\u2019ve already picked out my phone case. I\u2019m really not interested in changing my plan or anything like that - I really just want to upgrade my phone and be done with it.\u201d Fortunately, the guy was cool and was like \u201cno worries...I\u2019ll be right out with the new phone, and we\u2019ll get you checked out.\u201d",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>On the flip side of this: I\u2019ve found that reps generally (being a key word) <em>do</em> typically care about my wants/complaints/etc if I treat them like people (novel idea, I know), and understand that THEY did not cause my problem. I think I learned this from working at a gas station in my teenage years, where every other day the price of gas was somehow <em>my</em> fault. Or if the car wash broke down, I must\u2019ve been the one who broke it. Like, I totally get revealing your frustration, but you <em>also</em> have to understand that the person on the other end is just a person.</p>\n\n<p>When I call, I make sure to write down the rep\u2019s name immediately, and I\u2019ll use it occasionally to show respect (and then I have it if someone asks me whom I spoke to later on). If Comcast gave me a better offer than the Verizon rep is giving me, I\u2019ll explain that very politely....NOT in a snarky \u201cwell, <strong>Comcast</strong> is offering me more, so you should <strong>automatically</strong> be offering me more with your tail between your legs\u201d sort of way. It\u2019s always something along the lines of \u201cokay, thanks for that information. I\u2019m gonna need to do some thinking on this, because I\u2019m trying to watch my expenses, and I\u2019ve got a slightly better offer from Comcast...but this is still good to know.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>When I\u2019m irritated with service - or being told multiple different things from multiple different people - and I wish to speak to a supervisor, I generally go out of my way to be like \u201chey, I know this isn\u2019t your fault, so I\u2019m not taking it out on you....but I think I\u2019d like to talk to a supervisor. I\u2019ve just been given a lot of contradictory information, and I\u2019d like to speak to someone about that.\u201d And when the supervisor comes on, if the first person was genuinely nice or trying to help, I point that out. \u201cHey, I just spoke to Sarah - and she was great and really trying to help me out, but I felt like I needed to voice [complaint] to a supervisor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It may sound like a lot to unnecessary or even fake politeness when it\u2019s written down like this, but in practice, it\u2019s just basic pleasantry and calmness. I\u2019ve gotten so many better offers this way than a few people I know who do the whole <em>call and immediately threaten to cancel if I don\u2019t get everything I want</em> thing. Don\u2019t get me wrong....if you\u2019re getting fucked over, then you should absolutely be honest and upfront about how and why that\u2019s a problem. But in my experience, people typically want to help people who seem like respectful people. I got my original Verizon quote lowered by $35/month (with no price increase, in writing) after a few calls, and I think it\u2019s partially because I didn\u2019t give people a reason to think \u201cwow, fuck this asshole.\u201d Instead, I think I gave them a reason to think \u201cman....this guy has been given 4 different quotes from 4 different people, and he\u2019s still calling back with patience. Even while being stern, he\u2019s not resorting to insults and shouting. How can we fix this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: If you have a valid grievance, treat it as such - but don\u2019t be rude and think that you\u2019ll get whatever you want just because you state that you\u2019re willing to switch to another provider (which is an empty threat much of the time). </p>\n\n<p>All of that being said.....I\u2019m guilty of doing what OP did once.

Its such a breath of fresh air to have someone treat you like a real live person and not the embodiment of everything wrong with the company. \nOf course I still empathize with the customers who yell, scream, curse, etc. Believe me, I\u2019ve been a caller too and it sucks to be on the phone for over an hour because you were unjustly charged, or cancelled etc. It\u2019s just when you fill your whole work day with people chewing you out, it really takes a toll on you. I left most of my workdays with a headache.</p>\n</div>",

Hell, training was two full weeks, two full paychecks, at a decent wage. It wasn't the *worst* place I ever worked, for sure.\n\nI remember one day completing a somewhat complicated call and needing to write down notes in the customer's file for whatever it was. I put my headset on a setting indicating that I needed to write out a note, and I can't type, talk, listen to another customer, and read all at the same fecking time so taking another call before I was finished wasn't going to work for me. After a few minutes, one of the supervisors (who sat at a desk with a computer that showed what everyone was doing, what company they were sales-pitching for, what setting their headset was on, basically a giant snooper computer) called me to ask why I wasn't on-call. I explained that I had a lengthy note to write down for the last customer. Definitely didn't sound happy, but what else am I supposed to do?\n\nIt was crazy time-keeping, and you were hounded for up-sells, cross-sells, credit applications, phone call length, etc. They expected an \"average\" phone call to be something stupid like 6 minutes. I had a call upwards of 40 minutes because of a customer with a lost order (we had I swear 5 different programs for looking up orders, addresses, names, credit card numbers, phone numbers, anything you could imagine, we had a program for it- and by god I was gonna find that lady's order if it killed me (*and I* ***did***, and finally figured out wtf was wrong with it, fixed it, got her order receipt resent, she'd been back and forth on the phone with different agents for ages and no one could find it- but I did! never had a customer so happy with me)).\n\nI also got \"lucky\" once with a lonely old dude calling in on our Nascar line, which lasted about 30 minutes. He didn't want to buy anything, he just wanted to talk, and occasionally ask how much something was so it remained sort of relevant to the sales call- I desperately tried the \"well that's great, give us another call when you're ready to order!\" a couple times and he would not hang up. And if *I* hung up on *him*, then I'd get yelled at for it. But I also get yelled at for a longass phone call with no sale. Watchagonnado?\n\nNothing beats being literally screamed at over the phone how I personally ruined some kid's Christmas because an order was going to arrive on the 25th, tho. I mean, the lead times and the ship times are right there on the damned page, you have eyeballs, use them! But it sure was satisfying telling her \"ma'am, if you don't stop screaming at me, I am going to have to hang up the call\" and getting that sweet relief as she goes completely silent for 5 seconds before talking to me like a human again.\n\nOh, and someone placing an order with one company, and it's shipped by the competitor company because the sales agent logged into the incorrect website to place an order for a customer. So fun trying to explain that.\n\nAbsolutely do not miss that place.",
