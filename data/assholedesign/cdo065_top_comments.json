        "body": "Hey everyone, we've had a lot of fun in this thread, but I thought since there's been a lot of complaints about not understanding taxes and not teaching it in schools lately, I'd see if I can clear stuff up. Might help non-US folks understand as well! For what it's worth, I'm a software developer who worked at a tax company for years, but I don't consider myself a tax expert per se, but maybe higher than average.\n\nFirst off, this meme is wrong on several accounts and I'd like to address them here. The first, as others have said, is if you make an honest mistake on your tax return, you are not going to prison, you typically just owe the difference + a small penalty. \n\nThe second major area is the phrase \"we know exactly how much you owe\". This is patently false. The IRS knows how much income your employer (if any) reported to them. For most people, that's more or less it. They don't know what you spent your money on, nor if you did other non-reported work. This is why tax returns exist.\n\nMost 9-5 office jobs and things like that will automatically report your salary or earnings to the IRS so they know, as the year goes on, how much you've earned. For most people, this is probably the only income they earn. Some people do work that's not reported though. Freelance work, some contract work, and sometimes things like tips aren't automatically reported by payroll and need to be reported by the person filing taxes. \n\nIt's tempting to say \"oh ok, well once they know my income they now know how much I owe, right?\" Well yes, but also no. They know how much you'd owe if you had no itemized deductions and took the standard deduction. Okay what's that? You have two options when filing taxes. If your taxes are fairly simple (no home ownership, student loans, marriage bonuses \\[more on that soon\\], etc) then you can just say \"screw it, I don't want to tell you all my shit, just give me the minimum\". \n\nThis deducts a standard amount from your total owed. For a lot of younger people, this is ideal as it makes it simpler. However, until  you TELL the IRS that you are taking the standard deduction, they can't assume that's true.\n\nItemized deduction is where taxes get complicated. This is when you tell the IRS, ok, I have a bunch of shit going on in my life, and I think calculating my own deduction is higher than the standard one. I started doing this when I bought a house. You get deductions for a lot of stuff - charitable donations, home office space, interest on a house, and even stuff like paying other taxes or cost for tax preparation can be deducted. \n\nSo you can see that the IRS doesn't know every detail about how you spent your money, so it doesn't know the amount you owe!\n\nOther related myths:\n\n* Audits don't mean you did something wrong. Audits are the IRS checking your work. Some salary ranges and jobs and things can get you targeted for more audits, but the average person is usually audited due to good old fashioned random selection.\n* It is a MYTH that if you get a raise that puts you into the next tax bracket you could lose money. This is because tax brackets are for money ranges, not the total. For example (just to simplify) if bracket 1 is 0-50,000 and is 10%, and bracket 2 is 50-75,000 and is 15%, and you make 60,000, you are not taxed 15%. Your first 50k is taxed 10% and the other 10k is taxed 15%. Oversimplified for this example, but that's the gist of it.\n* It is a MYTH that filing jointly aka marriage saves you money. In fact, in many cases it can cost more. This is because the \"bonus\" for marriage applies if there's income disparity. In other words, if the husband makes a lot more than the wife, or if the wife doesn't work. Those instances, there's a bonus. If both members of the couple work, you can actually end up paying more. This graph shows the situation in 2015 at least:   [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/16/upshot/marriage-penalty-couples-income.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/16/upshot/marriage-penalty-couples-income.html) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can probably think of more but it seems like these are the big ones.",

I've been both PAYE (essentially full-time employment where you employer does your withholding and filing) and self employed (you file and pay the tax obligations directly) in the UK and in both circumstances the process to paying and filing taxes was easier than in the US where I am full-time employed. The US seems like an odd hybrid between PAYE and self employed from the UK. Your withholdings here are generally handled by your employer and what not, but you still need to file with the government in April and you may owe money in the end, this step is completely missing in the likes of the UK.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That is about what i do too. I can take solace on the fact that i live in a part of the world where nothing ever happens, not even climate change should make this place unlivable. If only Russia wasn&#39;t our next door neighbor, things would be excellent.. Sweden is right over the ditch, less than 100km away but in this scenario, it won&#39;t matter at all, buys me maybe a week.. Not even sea rise will affect me, i live on the largest hill, at the very peak. Second peak that emerged from the sea 1500 years ago: the whole town has risen from the sea since then so... i will be just fine sitting right here, it&#39;ll be like 1300s again, this is after all a safet town in one of the safest countries in the world with natural protection against elements (climate is funny, storms rarely go over the city, they either take a turn towards land or to the sea, both north and southernly, only east-west storms hit and that is rare.) SO whenever i think that the world could just burn, i know that i&#39;m privileged to just watch it happen before the maelstorm hits.</p>\n</div>",
