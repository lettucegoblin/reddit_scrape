But trying to slam 4.7 million people into one place is just a bad idea.  </p>\n\n<p>If everyone wanted to drop off their ballot, and spread it out evenly from now until election day, 188,000 people would need to drop by every day.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if you account for the fact that only about 40% of people vote (some are ineligible, some just don&#39;t show up), that leaves you with 75,000 votes to collect, every day, for the next 25 days.  </p>\n\n<p>Texas does require a reason to get an absentee ballot, and many people who vote absentee ballots will choose to mail it in. I tried to find out how many people dropped off ballots in 2016 to come up with a better estimate. But even after that, I expect more drop-offs in 2020, between covid making people sensibly avoid crowds, and Trump sabotaging the post office.  </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Texas doesn&#39;t actually matter, if it goes for Biden, Trump will be down so far in actual battleground states that it is already a landslide of historic proportions, and if it goes for Trump, that&#39;s what we expect anyway. If their Governor wants to make them into a national embarrassment, at least it won&#39;t change the results of the election.</p>\n</div>",

We can discuss why voting hasn't been updated more recently and thats fine, but it hasn't been and that's how it is for now.  Mail in has only been pushed because of COVID, but the problem is voting eligibility.  I know in Australia voting is mandatory, my wife is Australian.  But in the US, voting is not mandated, it's controlled by states, not federally, and we have ~12 million+ people who are undocumented(illegally in the country) and don't have the right to vote. I've lived in both California, a hard blue (democrat party) state, and I currently live in West Virginia, a pretty republican state and i've never had trouble voting in either location.  Pretty short waits, voting locations within walking distance of where i live.  Contrary to how Reddit portrays it, mail in voting is not as simple as it's made out to be.  Plus, with all the early voting allowances and drop off mail in, this isn't as big an issue as it's made out to be.  Reddit will have you believe we live in some fascist failed state when it's not anywhere as grim as its made.  The only real issues that no one seems to want to admit is that we've been turning politics into a game of reality tv, which has culminated in a reality tv star being President, but everyone acts as if he was the original problem instead of acknowledging that the narcissistic culture of clapbacks and shit-talk that's led us to where we are now.  Morons rule the public discourse.  The loudest people are recognized, on both sides of the aisle, as experts, and the people who are moderate are ignored, or worse, shouted down and invalidated.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>More than slightly. The Texas suburbs are running towards Democrats right now, which is shifting the whole state into purple territory. Texas is a pretty urban state, and unlike the midwest, Republicans are maxed out in rural areas in Texas, so they have no way to make up for their losses in the suburbs. Just compare some the votes of some urban-suburban counties between 2012 and 2018. Obama won Harris county(home to Houston and many of its suburbs) by less than 1000 votes in 2012, just .1%. Clinton won it by 12.6%. Beto won it by 16.7%. Texas is statistically tied right now, and Democrats are making a serious play for the state house. The state seems to be going the way of Virginia, where Democratic strength in the growing, formerly Republican, suburbs swing the state blue.</p>\n</div>",
