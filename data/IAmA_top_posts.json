Just finished a great rally in Charlottesville, and am looking forward to your questions. At the top, I do want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with folks who are dealing with Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf, and to let them know that we are going to be coordinating with state and local officials to make sure that we give families everything they need to recover.\n\nVerification photo: http://i.imgur.com/oz0a7.jpg\n\nLAST UPDATE: I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced plans to repeal net neutrality protections, which could have a devastating impact on consumers and small businesses alike. It's time for us to fight back and protect the open internet.\nNet neutrality is the principle that all data on the internet should be treated equally, regardless of its source or destination. This means that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot discriminate against certain types of traffic or prioritize some content over others. Without these protections in place, ISPs could charge more for faster speeds, block websites and services they don't like, and create \"fast lanes\" for companies that can afford to pay more.\nThis would have a chilling effect on free speech, innovation, and competition. Small businesses and startups would be unable to compete with larger corporations that can afford to pay for",

        "text": "Hi Reddit. I'm Senator Bernie Sanders. I'll start answering questions at 2 p.m. ET. The most important election of our lives is coming up on Tuesday. I've been campaigning around the country for great progressive candidates. Now more than ever, we all have to get involved in the political process and vote. I look forward to answering your questions about the midterm election and what we can do to transform America.\n\nBe sure to make a plan to vote here: [https://iwillvote.com/](https://iwillvote.com/)\n\nVerification: [https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1058419639192051717](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1058419639192051717)\n\nUpdate: Let me thank all of you for joining us today and asking great questions. My plea is please get out and vote and bring your friends your family members and co-workers to the polls. We are now living under the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. We have got to end one-party rule in Washington and elect progressive governors and state officials. Let\u2019s revitalize democracy. Let\u2019s have a very large voter turnout on Tuesday. Let\u2019s stand up and fight back.",
