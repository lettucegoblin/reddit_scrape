        "text": "My f16 father m46 is the \"breadwinner\" while mom is a sahm. She handles everything around the house like cooking, mopping, washing, laundry, etc. I'm the oldest and I try to help but really there's only so much I can do while my dad just gets home at the end of the day and literally complains about everything. like how the carpet isn't clean or how the food is cold.\n\n\nAs a result; I'd have to listen to a huge argument daily between him and mom. It's exhausting but honestly...I think that my dad is in the wrong here. I tried talking to him to get him to see how his behavior is but to no avail.\n\n\nSo what I did was pick a day off for him and pretend to act like him. I put together an outfit that looked like a suit and put black tape over my lips to look like a mustache. at 6pm. I went inside the house. Shouted \"I'M HOME!!\" then sat next to him in the living room and started kicking my shoes while complaining about the state of the house at the top of my lungs. He glanced at me confused asking what I was doing. I ignored him then started yelling about the carpet being dirty, shower not ready, the kids needing to be quiet and so on.\n\nHe kept staring while mom and my siblings laughed. My youngest brother kept pointing towards me saying \"this is daddy\". I then proceeded to yell about dinner then berated my mom for not preparing ut before time. My dad stopped me and in a serious tone asked what I was doing. I turned to him and said \"WHAT?! CAN'T A MAN EFFING REST AFTER WORKING LONG HOURS!!\" in the most macho voice I could muster. My dad got the hint because this was the common phrase he uses daily. He went quiet and avoided looking at me. I stopped the act and told him I was trying to show him what he's like everyday when he comes home from work. He said nothing, just went outside and refused to speak to me.\n\n\nLater he went on about how I \"mocked\" and invalidated him. That he does work hard and me doing this was disrespectful and invalidating. Mom said it was funny but also thought I hurt my dad's feelings and I could've gotten the message across some other way instead.\n\n\nAITA?",

He was adamant he didn\u2019t know anything about the credit card  or the apparent enquiries on his credit account about pay day loans. \nMy boyfriend is still refusing to open any fraud investigations against his family member and has said he will pay off the debt himself. \nBut.. \nSome other things came out during our conversation that he was hiding from me. \nLying has been a big issue of his during our whole relationship. In the past I have forgiven him for his lies but I can\u2019t keep forgiving the same issue every few months when he promises to change, but we\u2019re in the same spot every few months. \n(And I\u2019m not talking little lies, I\u2019m talking big lies and even bigger lies to cover up those lies) - I know I\u2019m stupid for giving him the benefit of the doubt - \n\nSo in saying this \u2026. \n\nMy boyfriend is now my ex boyfriend. \n\nWhen I spoke with my boyfriend about my concerns *above* he ended up picking up his bag and walking out on me and drove away. That was the last time I seen him in person. \nThis is how this man delt with an issue in our 5 year relationship. \nWe haven\u2019t spoke much since but I have definitely resigned to the fact my relationship is over. I think he is expecting me to forgive him like all the previous times. \nI have packed up his stuff and will return to him after my city comes out of our 6th lockdown. \n\nThere is a good ending to this story tho. \n\nI spoke with my mortgage broker and the housing developers. \nI can\u2019t afford the original townhouse I fell in love with alone but a smaller townhouse that I also loved came available and I\u2019ve been approved for this one. I paid my deposit 3 days before my birthday last month!! \nI bought a house by my self!! \n\nTLDR:\nI broke up with my lying boyfriend of 5 years and celebrated by buying my own house!\n\nEdit 1. Oh my gosh guys this update has blown up like I never through it would. I will try to get around to reading all the comments and messages I\u2019ve received \nThank you so much for all the well wishes and congratulations!!",

        "text": "Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call \"Jake\" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. \n\nWell 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me \"No, this is what is expected of you every night.\" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like \"Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change\" and \"You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work.\" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. \n\nI was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked \"Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this.\" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.\n\nI got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that \"I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby.\" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. \n\nSo AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because \"its a mothers job to deal with it\"?\n\nEDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",

        "text": "My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\n\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\n\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?\n\nEdit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.",

        "text": "Quick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy. \n\nAfter the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn\u2019t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there\u2019s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. \n\nThey got into counseling, for a year things were \u2018ok\u2019 on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. \n\nBefore the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fianc\u00e9e around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. \n\nThe wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn\u2019t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid\u2019s attended their father\u2019s wedding. \n\nShe was taken aback that I didn\u2019t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she\u2019ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. \n\nThe next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.\n\n\n*****ETA: First, I\u2019d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can\u2019t go back and undo that. \n\nSo, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work\u2026DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s dead to me now.\u201d Time will tell if he means that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll see this update too. For that reason, I\u2019m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won\u2019t be dead anymore. \n\nHis mom told him, \u201cYour children have to be our number one priority.\u201d They\u2019re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he\u2019ll understand this.",

He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company. \n\nHe brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs.\n\nI told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. \n\nOne of his friends asked about work and I said \"Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.\"\n\nI wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!  \n\nSome other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out\n\nI wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer\n\nIt got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.\n\nHe didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. \n\nI got irritated with his friends and asked \"Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?\" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying \"There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? \n\nMy boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.\n\nHe said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said \"at least they know I'm a rich bitch\" \n\nHe was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense.\n\nAITA for explaining why I'm not a gold digger?",

        "text": "My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife\u2019s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren\u2019t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. \n\nWhen we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like \"Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son.\" \n\nThis got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. \n\nAt the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. \n\nI told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. \n\nOverall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",

        "text": "This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n\n\nEdit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.\n\nEdit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.\n\nI sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.\n\nEdit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.\n\nBUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.\n\nI am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. \n\nI thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. \n\nThis post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",

        "text": "The title sounds bad but hear me out. \n\nBackstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks. \n\nThe issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a \"what was that\" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying \"Yeah, *I* purchased my house\". I asked \"does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues.\" She grinned and said \"it's just for the record\" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied \"Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you.\" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar \"my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way.\" My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50.\n\nEdit: Holy hell this blew up. Sorry I wasn't clear with my friends being 50/50, half think I'm NTA and the others think we're both assholes and I shouldn't have escalated the problem.",

        "text": "Hello. [Original post.](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oefrtm/aita_for_picking_out_the_peas_from_my_dinner_in/)\n\nThank you very much for your insight. I appreciate all the comments and also the awards. I think that's very cool to receive.\n\nSome comments said to talk about it with my mum. I did and it went very well. She said sorry and said it was not my fault. She explained to me how it went and I will try to tell it as short as possible:\n\nMum was very stressed because she never hosts dinners. She wanted her colleagues to like it. They requested the recipe. She forgot I don't eat peas because she was too busy with her colleagues.\n\nShe wanted me to eat with them because at her colleague's house his kids also ate with them. She didn't want to make a fuss about my autism because sometimes I'm rude when people ask about it. She said her head was all over the place all evening.\n\nI said to her that that's why I could have made my own food. She said that was difficult because there was no time for that. I didn't realise because I'm not good with time awareness. I asked her to communicate with me next time and be more clear about what I can or can't do. She said she will and said I can help cook next time too.\n\nAlmost every comment said that her boss was nice. He probably wasn't angry or upset with her. I told this to my mum. She said sorry to me again because she wasn't upset at me at all. She was embarrassed because she tried to get me to ''behave normally'' and she shouldn't have done that. She took it out on me on a whim.\n\nI also said sorry because I didn't realise that it could've been important for her work status. I just thought they were like friends. She said it was OK because I didn't make a big fuss and I didn't get loud or walk away. She's proud of me for staying at the table and also thinking about the ducks.\n\nWe concluded that we both learned things. I learned things because I now know more about work dinners and manners. She learned things because she now knows to communicate and explain more to me to avoid stress.\n\nIn the comments people also said her boss might have experience with autistic people. I asked my mum and it was a little bit sad. His little brother was autistic but he died 10 years ago. It made him sad because he loved him a lot.\n\nHe told her I should eat things I like next time because it upset him to think mum was worried about appearances so much that I had to be uncomfortable during dinner. He also said that dinner was really good and that he's happy to have her in his team at work. He's a good person and a good boss. I sent him a thank you email with my mum.\n\nLast thing is that I fed the ducks the peas. I think they were happy about it. The thing with ducks is that they don't say that to you of course. I got an ice cream with two scoops at the pond. I also got one for my mum because I had money left. It was a little bit melted when I came home because it was 5 minutes walking but she still liked it and she said I was amazing.\n\nThank you for reading.",

He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. \n\nHe never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying \"sorry, you don't understand that, haha\". During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining. \n\nWhen it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. \"Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary.\" I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted. \n\nAt the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. \n\nHe asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. \n\nI told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. \n\nHe was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment. \n\nWell, I did find it entertaining, but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?",

        "text": "I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She\u2019s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She\u2019s a really good kid and she\u2019s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn\u2019t present in her life, nor is my sons\u2019 mother. All four children share a bathroom.\n\nMy sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. \n\nMy eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn\u2019t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don\u2019t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.\n\nA few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she\u2019d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. \n\nShe laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who \u201csheds like a gorilla\u201d and has produced \u201cthree skid marking sons\u201d which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it\u2019s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn\u2019t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can\u2019t be flushed and that it\u2019s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. \n\nI later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she\u2019s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. \n\nThis is a genuine issue to me and she didn\u2019t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA?\n\nUPDATE \u2014 Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive \u201cperiods for pricks\u201d course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter. Thankyou for your input",

        "text": "So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.\n\n\nThe problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.\n\n\nShe'd barge in, then turns and says \"oh sorry\" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said \"so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!\". He seriously said that!.\n\n\nWe have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.\n\nSo I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she \"accidently\" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming \"she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom\". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel \"terrified/weirded out\" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.\n\n\nEdit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a \"me problem\" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow. Especially after what happened. Lol.",

        "text": "My (25F) father married my step-sister's (23F) mother when I was 4 and she was 3. We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close.\n\nShe developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.\n\nAnyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.\n\nI broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money.\n\nShe told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.\n\nFor the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.\n\nNow no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about.\n\nThank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touch\u00e9. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal:\n\nTurns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at.\n\nAnyhow, I called out of work sick the rest of the day and am going to drink a lot of alcohol. Like, a lot of alcohol. And then start thinking about what the fuck I'm going to do.",

Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.  \n\nSo, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.   \n\nI call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.  \n\nI ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to \"take a mental health day and do some self-care\". I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: \"I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that.\".  \n\nFrankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  \n\nSo I told her that she had two choices:  \n\n1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  \n\n2) I fire her completely.  \n\nShe's calling me all sorts of \"-ist\" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. \n\nNone of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. \n\nI think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  \n\nBut at the same time, she really could have called me.  \n\n\nSo, reddit, I leave it to you: Am I the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: I came back from making a sandwich and had 41 messages. I can't say I'm going to respond to every one of yall individually, but I am reading all of the comments. Anyone who asks a question I haven't already answered will get a response.",

He especially like to joke with my brother \"Ethan\" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.\n\n\nSome context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy \"Joey\" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.\n\n\nSo fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said \"Knock knock..\" Ethan laughed and said \"Who's there?\". Mike replied \"Joey's bio parents\" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an \"idiot\" to which Mike replied with \"Hey...Relax it was just a joke\". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.\n\n\nWe haven't talked to them for days.

        "text": "So, its been a few days since my original post. Everyone was so kind, helpful and supportive. I recieved so many messages and I want to thank each one of you for them. They meant more to me than you know. \n\nWell, I've left my husband. And it really wasn't over this one incident, but really a build up of many. Before I even made the post, I wasn't completely blind to what he had been doing in terms of control. As weird as it seems, sometimes I just forget I am an adult and I don't have to just 'yes sir' and listen to any man thats older than me. **I'm** an adult now. I make my own rules. I feel sick saying this, but I realize I had been viewing him as a parental figure and not a partner. It kind of makes my stomach twist to even type that, but that is what it is. I don't really want to analyze it right now, its too gross. \n\nI'm honestly going through a really tough grieving time right now. I feel like such a failure. What's worse is that he does not care in the least. When I called him to tell him I was leaving, he said \"Ok. Let me know when you want to grab your stuff, we can have you moved out ASAP.\" And that was it. That was all he said before he hung up the phone. I'm really hurting. I loved him so much, and I think part of me just wanted to see if he was willing to fight for me and apologize. He was not, so thats that. \n\nBut, although I'm hurting, I feel free. My mom has welcomed me back, shes so happy I am divorcing him. I got together with my friends who he wouldn't let me see. I watched tv shows he told me were too childish. And Ive been wearing ugly sweatpants and oversize tshirts that he always said made me \"look like a man.\" \n\nSo thank you, all of you. I got a wakeup call I desperately needed. I don't even WANT to be a housewife. I never wanted that for me (no hate on anyone who does, honestly guys it was hard and lonely work). I am going to get my RN, and then move on to my masters. You've all encouraged me in the best way possible.",

They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say \"hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out\" and in it she explains how she \"rescued\" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free. \n\nI was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said \"you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen\" her friend says \"well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?\" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her. \n\nThey say that I'm a bully and walk away. I later get called into the principal's office who told me I was expected to apologize, and I said no, I stand by what I said. Fuck ignorant people who destroy the environment. My parents were called over and I got sent home and my parents are pissed I refused to apologize. I might get suspended.",

        "text": "My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fianc\u00e9 [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can\u2019t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a \u201cZoom\u201d wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy sister didn\u2019t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. \n\nShe and her fianc\u00e9 decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fianc\u00e9 and quote \u201covershadow\u201d them on their big day \u201cthat was already scaled down\u201d. However, her and her fianc\u00e9 said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. \n\nFast-forward to the day of the wedding\u2014everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they\u2019d like to talk so it doesn\u2019t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he\u2019s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He\u2019s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like \u201c(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it\u2019s given me the courage to do this....\u201d then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??\n\nI immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he\u2019s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I\u2019s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. \n\nThe rest of the wedding went smoothly\u2014except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??",

        "text": "This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.\n\nMy wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.\n\nI gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.\n\nI (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to \"even the score.\"\n\nI told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",

I looked over at his mom\u2019s smug face as I was about to pay the checked baggage fee. And I let all of my frustrations out on the attendant and started crying. Basically she said don\u2019t go with that family sweetie they don\u2019t appreciate you. Continues to cry and took my luggage and got out and got out of line with the super sweet check in woman. I was so upset on how I was treated and started crying on my boyfriend in the airport about how his mother was treating me. \n\nI broke up with him at the airport and his mother was so embarrassed.

        "text": "EDIT: to all of you who DMed me to tell me about how fucking great polyamory is and that you're mad I gave it a bad name, you have issues if that's what you take away from this post\n\nI believe it started when I was around 6 years old. My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.\n\nThey gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. \n\nI always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. \n\nA while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'. Even though I tried to, it's like I can't reply, this argument brought something very emotional up in me.\n\nAITA for hurting my parents over this, especially since I have never brought it up before?",

It seems a bit silly now that I was so consumed and frustrated by something so small as cookies but here we go. \n\nAs a number of the comments suggested, I ended up talking to the owner of the shop and telling her that I wasn\u2019t going to bake cookies for the retreats anymore. I told her I felt belittled and disrespected by her behavior and that of the retreaters. Her response was basically \u201cthey expect the cookies. What do you expect me to tell them? They\u2019re not going to want to come to retreats anymore. You should have never baked them at all- this whole issue is going to be bad for business.\u201d I went home feeling completely invalidated. She completely gaslit me. I read and reread some of your commends multiple times and decided to stand my ground on this. She didn\u2019t threaten to fire me or anything (not that she could have- she needed me) but she continued to guilt trip me and try to manipulate me into baking again. She even had some of the retreaters come to me offering me money to bake for the retreats. At this point it wasn\u2019t about the pay- it was how people were treating me. I refused and started applying to other jobs because I was sick of the environment. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m actually a licensed pharmacist. I was working for minimum wage at a quilt shop because I was burnt out in an over saturated and overworked field. I was depressed because i was a doctor of pharmacy- 8 years of college completed, and i didn\u2019t feel mentally fit for working in that field because of my mental health. I worked for this quilt shop for a year. I learned some things, got a break, and regained some of the mental health I lost. This cookie debacle was the push I needed to regain my self worth and go back to the field that I wanted to be in. Within a month I found a job as a pharmacist at a federal prison. I loved it from my first day. \n\nI\u2019ve been there a year now and I love every day of it. My job has meaning, my coworkers are awesome, and every day is a new experience. It took a few months, but I got my baking mojo back. I\u2019m known throughout the prison by my actual name and people come to visit the pharmacy for some cookies (or whatever baked good I decide upon) and they stay for conversation. I found a job I love and a group of people who appreciate my baking and don\u2019t use me as a cookie slave. Thanks, Reddit. You guys are awesome.",

        "text": "I have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9\" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me \"slim\" and I even heard her say one time \"go ask toothpick\" and she has said stuff like \"you need some meat on your bones\" & \"you need to eat\". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. \n\nToday when she said \"morning slim\" I replied \"morning chunky\" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is \"different\" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a \"compliment\". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's \"a high school issue and we should figure it out\".\n\nEDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.",

Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.\n\nAfter the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.\n\nI have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to \"fuck off and go fuck themselves\" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.\n\nEdit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.\n\nEdit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",

        "text": "When I (17 M) was 8, my parents bought me a piano and signed me up for lessons. I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town.\n\nWhen I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.\n\nI should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs.\n\nI should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair.\n\nSo, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.\n\nA couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, \"A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!\" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.\n\nEver since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

I say this not to be a hater, I truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. Neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they\u2019ve got under 1500 followers combined). \n\nAnyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. Very platonic. \n\nAnyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don\u2019t want \u201cthe public\u201d to know they are dating. I would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don\u2019t. Also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. \n\nAnyway I asked what they meant, and they said they didn\u2019t want to end up in gossip rags....\n\nI pointed out that they are not famous and that they don\u2019t even have functioning IMDb pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names. \n\nI think they\u2019re delusional but they\u2019ve been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). At this point, I don\u2019t even want to be their friend. However, and probably because I\u2019m an asshole, I don\u2019t want to delete it based solely on principle.\n\nEdit: okay, so many of y\u2019all are right. I suppose I should separate how I feel about their (ridiculous/delusional/stupid) reasoning with the fact that no one should have an image of themselves online that they don\u2019t want made public.

She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.\n\n\nI showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed.

I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. \n\nIn some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.\n\nBut in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as \"the girl with the scar\" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.\n\nThis week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.\n\nI'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. \n\nIt also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.\n\nSo I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.\n\nI wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... \n\nHis father said to me, \"Can you cover that injury?\" \n\nI said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. \n\nHe started snapping at me saying \"there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.\"\n\nI said \"this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.\"\n\nHe started to backtrack saying \"just until it's healed\" and I said \"it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. \n\nHe actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.\n\nAITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?",

That's how I met my now fianc\u00e9 (37M) tho he was never my client.\n\nWe began to date when I was 25 and three or four months after that his BIL ''exposed me'' (no idea how he found out) because *there's no way my fianc\u00e9 knew* and thus we had to come clean in front of his whole family. Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fianc\u00e9s aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fianc\u00e9 shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us.\n\nHe proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fianc\u00e9s child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''.\n\nWell, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fianc\u00e9 got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left. \n\nLater my fianc\u00e9's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised. Now they're all demanding that I apologize to my FIL.",

        "text": "**UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE**\n\nThis happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. \n\nI F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. \n\nHe knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn\u2019t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. \n\nSome background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. \n\nI found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn\u2019t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. \n\nAfter finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.\n\nI was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn\u2019t bother him.\n\nLast night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.\n\nHis best female friend Jessica laughed and said \u201cI wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.\u201d\n\nI looked at her with an \u201cexcuse me?\u201d Look on my face and she just said \u201cnevermind\u201d and walked away. \n\nI confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote \u201cshe\u2019s just messing with you. You can\u2019t take a joke?\u201d\n\nSo I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said \u201cwell, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.\u201d \n\nI asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said \u201cyou know\u2026messing with best friends?\u201d \n\nHe then pat me on the shoulder and said that it\u2019s okay because I\u2019m not who I was back then and if he could get over my \u201ccolourful past\u201d and \u201cthot mentalities\u201d to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica\u2019s comments and give her another chance.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.\n\nHe was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn\u2019t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.\n\nI thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they\u2019re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. \n\nI responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn\u2019t a \u201cthot\u201d and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. \n\nHe started screaming how I\u2019m \u201cthe biggest AH\u201d for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my \u201ccolourful past.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe taking it back went too far. \n\nAITA?",

I always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before, I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We're only human and it's a part of life.\n\nLast weekend I got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. She was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.\n\nI got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.\n\nI haven't told my wife about it, because I don't want to violate the deal I made with her. I want her to know that she can trust me. I just hope I'm making the right choice.",

I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.\n\nThen she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. \n\nI told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.\n\nSo I threw her out. \n\nThe money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income.

        "text": "The past couple of months, my wife has been complaining about our cats. She\u2019s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she\u2019s frustrated every night that she \u201chas to get up and open the door for the cats\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep making noises\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep jumping on her.\u201d It got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. I told her I\u2019ve never seen or heard any of this, but she claims I sleep through it all.\n\nShe kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something.\n\nOne morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren\u2019t adding up, so I decided to run a test.\n\nI waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened.\n\nSure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it.\n\nI told her, \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?\u201d She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole.\n\nI did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up.\n\nSo, am I an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nMy wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public.\n\nI got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some \u201cfamily therapy.\u201d Apparently she finally wanted to talk.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m pretty pissed at the reason why she\u2019s been so hateful towards my cats. It\u2019s absolutely asinine.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s not sick physically or mentally. She\u2019s not bored of the relationship and looking for an \u201cout.\u201d*\n\nAccording to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She\u2019s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it\u2019s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them.\n\nI asked her why she didn\u2019t just tell me the truth and why she\u2019d been lying and refused to talk about it when I\u2019d asked. Her answer was \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t have gotten rid of them otherwise.\u201d and explained that when she saw I wasn\u2019t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a \u201cgoal\u201d to have me pick her over them.\n\nSickening. Don\u2019t know why she actually admitted to it all.\n\nThe woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I\u2019m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I\u2019ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband.\n\nMy wife started shouting at me that I\u2019ve betrayed her and that I\u2019m \u201cscum\u201d for choosing animals over her. At least cats don\u2019t give ultimatums like she gave.\n\nIt sucks that she\u2019s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it\u2019s for the best right now. She\u2019ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know.\n\nI\u2019m almost sure I\u2019m going for divorce. I\u2019m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don\u2019t want to worry about them being harmed or \u201cdisappearing.\u201d Screw that.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll do what almost all of you suggested: \u201cKeep the cats, rehome the wife.\u201d Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn\u2019t always nice.\n\n**If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:**\n\n***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds.\n\n***I\u2019m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won\u2019t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules.\n\n***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I\u2019m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn\u2019t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn\u2019t, I generally assume they\u2019re lying. Shame on me.\n\n***If you want even more context/questions answered, simply go through my comment history.***",

        "text": "Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. \n\nHe seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can\u2019t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she\u2019s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  \n\nMy wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. \n\nSince my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. \n\nSome of the advice I\u2019ve heard my wife give is \u2018oh it\u2019s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!\u2019 Or \u2018oh honey don\u2019t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would\u2019 and similar. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away \u2018two people in a partnership should be contributing equally\u2019 and my personal favorite \u2018if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it\u2019s reasonable to split the payment\u2019. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven\u2019t been anywhere obviously since we\u2019re home but the way she talks about him \u2018oh I\u2019ll just ask him to pay for x\u2019 etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother\u2019s advice, i.e. \u2018if you really liked me you\u2019d pay for x\u2019 \n\nI spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it\u2019s a rite of passage for girls and it\u2019s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it\u2019s not cute for her to be thinking it\u2019s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",

I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. \n\nA week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. \n\nSo I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like \"Fucking fat bitch\" under her breath but nothing directly to me. \n\nSo Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?",

I've only ever stayed at my dad's on weekends so it's been hard getting used to living with his gf and her kid full time. The kid is super whinny and pretty spoiled because gf dotes on her so I usually just stay in my room.\n\nToday gf was taking her daughter on a \"special outing\" because she passed a math test, and my dad suggested I go with them for a \"girls day out\". I wanted to say no but I knew that he wanted me to get to know his gf and gf's daughter better so I agreed. He gave gf $300 to spend during the outing.\n\nWe spent the day going in and out of stores gf's daughter liked in the mall complex. Gf ended up buying her a shit ton of clothes, makeup, and other stuff I don't remember. On our way back home gf stopped at the Starbucks cause daughter wanted a drink and some cakepops. She ordered a drink for her and her daughter and 2 cake pops. I asked her if I could get something and she said she ran out of money and she'd \"get me something next time\". When they got their order I asked if I could have one of the cakepops and gf said that it was her daughter's treat for hard work and it would be wrong for me to take one since \"I didn't do anything that deserved being rewarded\".\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I was pretty upset. When we got back home my dad saw their drinks and asked where mine was. I told him that \"I wasn't allowed to get one cause I don't deserve it\". His gf got upset and said I was twisting her words and the daughter just said I was being greedy and was jealous of her. I know I'm not entitled to a drink or a cakepop but I also don't think it's wrong to be a little annoyed. AITA?",

        "text": "Hi all. \n\nI gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. \n\nMy cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. \n\nIt was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\n\nToday I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \u00a31800) since it was completely ruined. \n\nI have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. \n\nAm I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",

I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. \n\nI'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. \n\nSometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.\nMy fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. \n\nBeing able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. \n\nMy fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. \n\nI grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.\n\nSo here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.\n\n~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~\n\nI decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. \n\nBut in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. \n\nI just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. \n\nI can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.\n\nI was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn\u2019t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn\u2019t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn\u2019t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?\n\nPlease do NOT comment yet, read this:\n\nOk I don\u2019t know how to explain this without being misunderstood but could you guys do me a small favor? I used a throwaway account for privacy reasons but the thing is, if this post blows up, there is a high chance for my friend to still see this. Could you please instead of commenting, DM me if your judgement is \u2018YTA\u2019? I promise if I get a lot of YTA dms I am going to ACCEPT the judgement as per rule 3 but it\u2019s just weird if my friend sees this and sees \u2018YTA\u2019 comments especially after our last argument, you guys get what I mean right? Thank you.\n\nEDIT: Oh cmon guys. This post if 1 in rising now. Can't you please do as I asked you? Would you be ok posting on this subreddit just to get comments full of YTA and your friends see them and laugh at you?\n\nEDIT: Hey mods! Please check your inbox as I sent you a message. It's urgent.\n\nEDIT: Ok the mods responded about automod and they basically told me to suck it up and deal with it wth? Guys please just do as I asked you. I accept my judgement",

        "text": "My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). \n\nOur counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said \"honestly, no\". \n\nI love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. \n\nMy wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old \"daddy wishes you were never born\" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.\n\nYes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. \n\nIt has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. \n \nAITA for saying it though?\n\nEdit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. \n\nWhen I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. \n\nYeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  \n\nJust because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. \n\nMy first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.\n\nRegarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him.

        "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/\n\nI posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and I were having with our baby's name. We had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....\n\nMiles Trayvon\n\nWe thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be \"Tray\" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, \"This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence.\" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.\n\nI had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, \"Her name is Daisy.\" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put \"Ray Smith\", Demarcus Jones would put \"Marcus Jones\", Keshawnda Nelson would put \"Shawna Nelson\", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone. It's a family name on my husband's side.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the DMs but please stop sending me articles about the woman named Marijuana Pepsi and the black Spider-Man named Miles. Thanks y'all.",

This was very helpful as I did not want him to feel pressured to come out.\n\nWhen I wrote my original post, I was already watching Schitt's Creek, which had non-straight main characters. This was really convenient because I could simply say remarks like \"Awww, they make a really nice couple\" and \"Wow, I wish my relationship with my gf was like that.\"\n\nI also asked my bro about Pride month (he has been going to marches as an ally for the past few years with his out friends). I asked him \"Hey, what's their plan for Pride month during quarantine? Too bad they can't hold the march, I was thinking of joining.\"\n\nI didn't really know how to be subtle, okay.\n\nWhen our parents went grocery shopping last weekend, that's when he told me. \"You already know, don't you?\" I knew what he was asking but I tried to play dumb. \"You know, that I'm gay, right?\"\n\nI just said yes, told him about the iPad incident, and hugged him. He cried and asked me not to tell our parents, which of course I agreed to. He then asked if this changes anything between us, to which I replied \"Of course, now you have to give me better fashion advice!\" (I make jokes when I'm emotional, okay)\n\nI told him he has my support no matter what, and that I can help him come out to our parents when he's ready. I also told him that he and his boyfriend (which he confirmed) are a great couple, then I reminded him that they should always be \"safe\" (Giving sex advice to my brother was VERY awkward).\n\nThat's it. He's still annoying as hell, because, you know, he's my brother, but I've never seen him happier, and I can really feel that a burden has been lifted off his shoulders.\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\nEDIT: I just realized that it's now June! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH, EVERYONE!\n\nEDIT2: Wow, this kinda blew up! I was just doing what any caring brother would do, and I'm glad it has a positive effect on other people. I was raised with values to love and accept everyone, regardless of gender/sexuality, so that will never change especially for my bro. Again, thank you for the overwhelming support!",

        "text": "\n\nMy fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.\n\nHowever, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be \"the good ol' salads & appetizers\" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served \"salad\". my fiance made a face and said \"isn't that what vegans eat?\". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.\n\n\nThe other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.\n\n\nAITA for putting my foot down on this?\n\nUPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to \"address\" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept \"acting dismissive\" of her son's input and \"contributations\" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying \"I paid for it\" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of \"my money, I paid for it\" mentality. She finally mentioned how \"bad\" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my \"weird\" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and \"the family\" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.\n\nI'll update if there's anything worth adding after we talk.",

I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month.\n\nMy friends think I'm being too harsh, but my cat could have died because of her and I don't want her trying anything else.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.\n\nMy son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.\n\nI asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a \"test run\" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.\n\nWe had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.\n\nI was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his \"first experience\" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.\n\nAITA?\n\nINFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the time\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives",

I didn\u2019t have a shitty childhood. The favoritism started when my sister was diagnosed. I moved out soon after and have been pretty independent since then. Not saying that how my parents treated me during those years were a-ok, but I wasn\u2019t Cinderella.\n\n2. I did not drink myself into oblivion. I had two white wine spritzers. But I appreciate the concern from folks!\n\nAnyhow, the update:\n\nI got in touch with my sister and asked her to meet up again at a park (no bill involved). I asked her if she was pregnant and she told me the truth. She said she wanted us to still be in each other\u2019s lives and that she wanted me to be in her baby\u2019s. A redditor (and I forget who, I\u2019m sorry) mentioned that she may ask me to be the godmother and that person was correct. But as many of you pointed out \u2014 if I didn\u2019t cut her off, I\u2019d just become her bank and daycare employee. So I told her I could no longer be in her life. And I left her crying on a park bench and felt like the shittiest person in the world.\n\nI emailed my parents and told them how betrayed I felt and that I\u2019d be cutting off contact with them. To my stepmom\u2019s credit, she apologized. She explained that she never thought my sister would live to have kids and that she let her emotion over that get the better of her. Understandable. My dad said nothing, which is honestly what sucked the worst about all of this.\n\nBen tried messaging me from a burner account for the first time since the break-up but I blocked him without reading it.\n\nI didn\u2019t go nuclear and post the story to Facebook as some suggested but I sent an email to the extended family members who I care about. I explained the situation and how I\u2019d be distancing myself from my family. Some have made it an us-versus-them situation and as much as I appreciate the support, feeling like I\u2019m in some valiant battle just makes me more tired. So I haven\u2019t been talking to much of anyone in my family.\n\nI feel lonely and crappy, but I think I made the right decision.\n\nAnyhow, not the most exciting update in the world but hopefully everyone knows that I\u2019m not dead. I do really appreciate the support I\u2019ve gotten \u2014 it made me smile during a really shitty time.\n\nAnd hey, if anyone in the greater Boston area wants an extra guest at Thanksgiving, lemme know.\n\nTL;DR: Ended up cutting off my family.",

        "text": "I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.\n\nWe had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. \n\nA minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.\n\nShe just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.\n\nI thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. \n\nIt bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.\n\nI sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)\n\nAnyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.\n\nI said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. \n\nHowever, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.\n\nI also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the \"do not hire\" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. \n\nShe fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.\n\nAITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier",

        "text": "\n\n\n\nI f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.\n\nI handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself \"well, at least she cooks for us!\".\n\n\nLast night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was \"probably\" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said \"Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry\". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't \"show up for dinner\" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said \"I don't know, maybe save some food for me?\" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life \"on pause\" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.\n\n\nHe picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me \"nuts\" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over \"food\".\n\n\n\n**Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**\n\n\n**one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he \"can't come\" see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came**\n\n\n**Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me \"for real this time\" ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!**\n\n\n**Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also \"talk\" (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",

I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M\u2019s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we\u2019re held to strict standards.  \n\nMy husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. \n\nThis is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can\u2019t be detailed). However, it\u2019s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. \n\nMy company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.\n\nIt\u2019d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don\u2019t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. \n\nI asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we\u2019d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. \n\nHe was extremely angry, and said I was \u201cselfish and only cared about money.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn\u2019t possible. \n\nHe continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn\u2019t being a supportive wife. \n\nI feel so betrayed, and I\u2019ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it\u2019s better coming from my email than from a background check. \n\nI told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. \n\nI feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It\u2019s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",

A lot has happened since my OP\n\nI spoke to the manager of the dental practice. I explained that my boyfriend (BF) had been open to me about not paying and that he doesn\u2019t plan to. The manager said a letter was already on the way demanding the payment, and if BF fails to pay then court proceedings will begin. He was thankful I called and knew it was their mistake, but was surprised by my BF\u2019s attempts to argue with him. That\u2019s a good result for now. \n\nI didn\u2019t plan on telling my BF as I wanted to end it (there\u2019s been too many red flags, so I decided I couldn\u2019t ever truly trust him) and I didn\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire. But before I got to end our relationship in person, I learnt another painful lesson. \n\nRecently my BF\u2019s laptop broke. This was fine as it was old and he can\u2019t work from home anyway (he sells cars), so he\u2019s used mine. Earlier this week I\u2019m on my laptop working and go to check my personal emails, except my BF\u2019s email was still logged in when I opened the webpage. I go to log out but saw the most recent 30 ish emails were all from the same person, a girl. This was weird as who emails like that to converse anymore? I know it was an invasion of privacy, but I clicked onto the emails. \n\nI deduced this was a girl from his work, they were emailing because her mobile phone was broken, and emailing him from her work email during the day was an easy way for them to still talk. The emails were flirtatious. They mentioned dates they\u2019d been on, he\u2019d clearly been to her house, they spent lunch breaks together and she thought he was single. The more I read the more enraged I became. What if I\u2019d never clicked the email? After considering where I could bury him, I decided to remain calm. \n\nI called my manager to tell her what I\u2019d just learned, she\u2019s super cool and said to take the afternoon. I then called an emergency locksmith and packed up my BF\u2019s stuff (he alternates between staying at mine and his mums), except for his PS5 I bought for his 25th birthday last month. When this purge of my BF from my life was ready, I text him: \n\n \u201cI know about S. Our relationship is over, your things are on the doorstep. You must transfer me the money for XYZ. Please don\u2019t ever contact me again.\u201d\n\nAnd blocked him on everything.\n\nA little while later, there\u2019s knocking are at my door as he\u2019s pleading to be let in to talk about it. I can see him but stay silent where he can\u2019t see me. He was on his knees crying, begging, pleading for me not to leave him. Whether they were crocodile tears or not, my heart *ached*. After some time he left with his stuff. I felt relief and had a good cry, but I doubt that\u2019s the last I\u2019ll hear from him.\n\nI feel heartbroken, and stupid. An enormous thank you to all those who said his behaviour was revealing of his character/what he\u2019s capable of, I will apply the same vigilance to future partners. I know this is a dodged bullet, but it hurts like hell.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nJust wanted to clarify some things: \n\n- I kicked him out of *my* house. I own it, he\u2019s never paid anything towards it and has no documentation linking him to my house. He alternates between staying at mine and his mother\u2019s, with his mother\u2019s being his official and primary residency. \n\n- Weirdly, some of you were really focused on the fact I kept the PS5. But I paid for it, have the receipts and it never left my home. I feel like retracting this gift he\u2019s had little over a week as an asshole tax is morally justified after he\u2019s been a 5* asshole. (And last time I checked this was a moral judgement not a legality sub?). \u2026I think they\u2019d be very different comments if this was the other way round and he\u2019d just given me an engagement ring and then found out I was cheating not even 2 weeks later. Yes it\u2019d be mine under the jurisdiction of a gift, but is it morally right I get to keep the ring? Probably not.\n\n- I noted down the email of the girl my ex was cheating with in case I wanted to contact her directly. I was thinking of constructing a message explaining everything and assuring her I\u2019m not bitter towards her. Then it\u2019s up to her what she wants to do with that info.\n\nThanks so much for all the supportive messages and comments, I am reading every single one. I\u2019m honestly shocked at the amount of kindness from strangers!",

My wife needed to take our son to an appt nd I needed to WFH today so my MIL came to watch after our daughter.\n\nMy daughter needed to use the bathroom, and I was going to excuse myself from my online meeting but my MIL said she had it. A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)\n\nI excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.\n\nI said to her, \"You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?\" \n\nShe told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out. She did leave, and about ten minutes layer my wife called me and said her mom was furious with me and said I was terrible to her and made her leave without any reason. After explaining, my wife is on my side. \n\nAITA for defending my daughter's \"real\" vagina?",

        "text": "For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn\u2019t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I\u2019d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn\u2019t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s still always \u201cforgetting\u201d where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we\u2019ve put locks on the rooms we don\u2019t want her in, there isn\u2019t really a problem anymore.  \n\nWell over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn\u2019t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn\u2019t need to lock the doors since she wouldn\u2019t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  \n\nI did this once before when husband didn\u2019t believe me about the snooping to prove she\u2019d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn\u2019t say anything about it but then my husband couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. \n\nHusband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There\u2019s a  baby gate so the kids can\u2019t get upstairs either. \n\nWell guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I\u2019m the asshole.  MIL also says I\u2019m the asshole but SIL says I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it\u2019s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA?\n\nETA: I can\u2019t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple\u2019s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.  \n\nI will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.  \n\nAnd if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)",

She's an absolute sweetheart of a baby, and I'm totally in love with her. Between March and May, I didn't get to see her at all in person, but I was doing regular FaceTime/House Party calls with Stephanie and Karen, and over the last few weeks, I've been going over to Stephanie's house to sit in her backyard and chat with Stephanie/coo at Karen from a lengthy distance.\n\nI have two reasons for updating. First, I've realized since Karen's birth that her name has taken on new meaning to me. When I'm with her, Karen just means *her*, and I don't think about the other connotations. In other words, you guys were right!\n\nThat said, though, my second reason for updating is that Stephanie got back into her years-unused Facebook at the beginning of the pandemic to keep in touch with people. She's been on it pretty regularly lately for the first time in years (historically, she's not really been into social media). Most people in our area/social circle have been posting really heavily about BLM and the protests happening right now, as well as racial justice issues more generally. As a result, Stephanie has now come into contact with a *deluge* of Karen memes for the first time, and found them confusing and horrifying, especially the use of \"Karen\" as shorthand for a racist. I've basically just declined to talk about it with Stephanie, because it went so poorly last time, but both *my* mother and *her* mother have hounded me about it because it's upsetting to Stephanie, and said things like, \"Is *this* what you were talking about before? Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you explain it better?! You should have told Stephanie!!\"\n\nAnd Jesus wept!! You really can't win.\n\nThanks again for all your feedback on my last post! It was very helpful in giving me some Zen about the situation.\n\nEdit: Wow, I've been super overwhelmed by the *flood* of very kind, heartfelt PMs (and just one or two not so kind ones) as well as the comments on my other post. Thank you, everyone! It continually amazes me how many nice and empathetic people frequent a sub devoted to assholes.",

Whenever I read posts like mine on here, I'm always wondering, did OP leave that asshole, so for those of you who care, I left that asshole.\n\nA lot of you were on the nose that this wasn't the only way that he was controlling. My ex believes that he's the smartest person in the room, so if you're doing something differently than how he would, then you're doing it wrong and must be corrected.\n\nI'm not saying that everyone's responses to my post gave me a revelation and I immediately knew what I had to do, but it was a nail in the coffin.\n\nI'm living within an hour of my parents now when before I was on the opposite side of the country. I have a job as a caregiver and am planning to go to grad school to be a social worker. I have a boyfriend who doesn't try to control every aspect of my life. When I go grocery shopping, I'm not stressing about accidentally buying the wrong brand of pasta (which was the right brand of pasta when we lived in a different state, I still don't get that) or juice that's from concentrate. And I've switched to pre-ground coffee because fuck you, I want to. None of this would've happened if I'd stayed with him.\n\nSo yeah, thank you to everyone who played a tiny role in helping me see what an unhealthy relationship I was in.",

So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day. \n\nI just can\u2019t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn\u2019t simply let this go. \n\nAITA for this?",

        "text": "I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.\n\u200b\n\nFive months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said \"This is John\" and described my job.\n\n\u200b\n\nTed: \"Hi, Jack.\"\n\nMe: \"It's John.\"\n\n\u200b\nTed: \"What?\"\n\u200b\n\nMe: \"My name's John, not Jack.\"\n\nTed: \"It's close enough for me.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nThis continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him \"You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nHis response was \"Sure thing, Jackie boy.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSince I don't work directly with him, I figured \"screw it\" and that I'd ignore him.\n\n\u200b\n\nRecently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says \"Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!\"\n\n\u200b\n\n(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)\n\n\u200b\n\nAs promised, I ignored him.\n\n\u200b\n\n7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.\n\nThe first one was along the lines of \"Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.\"\n\nE-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.\n\n\u200b\n\nI signed out and went home. It was raining hard.\n\nNext morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams \"Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!\" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor: \"Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.\n\nSupervisor: \"I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt.\" he sighed and said \"With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.\n\n\u200b\n\n*AM* I the a-hole on this?",

        "text": "A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.\n\nWe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.\n\nCue a question I drew: \"What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?\"\n\nSome backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.\n\nI didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, \"Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\nEveryone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said \"well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nIf things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",

My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn\u2019t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn\u2019t even explain to me what was going on, just \u201cyou\u2019re going to go visit gran for awhile\u201d and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now.\n\nMy sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment.\n\nThey finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like \u201cYou really don\u2019t recognize us?\u201d And I said \u201cOh, are you my dad\u2019s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d\n\nMy gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they\u2019re grieving, but I don\u2019t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.",

We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. \n\nMy mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  \n\nMy boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  \n\nWe didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  \n\nI am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  \n\nI may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  \n\nThey took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. \n\nNow they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. But I miss my dad and he is blameless in this. \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nI'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of things that keep being repeated.  \n\n1. How was staying at a hotel so we didn't break her rules not the adult choice?\n\n2. How many of you guys fly across the country or drive for hours to just stay one night?",

He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.\n\nSo I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.",

When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. \n\nApples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. \n\nFinally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n",

        "text": "Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. \n\nMy daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as \"liberal\", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n\nMy parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.\n\nAs I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.\n\nAnna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.\n\nNo advice needed, but I have to know. Have I been an ass?",

        "text": "I \\[20 F\\] am an older sister to my little (biological) brother (17 M) who finished high school last year. My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own).\n\nMy brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me.\n\nNote that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though.\n\nAnyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week. \n\nThe fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: \"you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later.\" He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified.\n\nThey asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?",

Many of you asked for an update, so here goes:\n\nLast weekend, the girls were at their mom\u2019s. After she dropped them off Sunday night, my 12yo asked to talk to me in private. We went into her room, and she showed me two recordings she\u2019d taken on her phone; one of my ex trying to convince them I was abusing them, and one of her and her husband arguing about how much she was paying in child support, and I\u2019ll be honest here - my cousin is a family court lawyer and basically raked her over the coals. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but I was still extremely hurt over the affair. I even got alimony.\n\nAnyway, my 12yo told me she didn\u2019t want to go to her mom\u2019s anymore, but she said she felt she had to because she\u2019s the oldest sibling and it\u2019s her job to protect the younger ones. I\u2019ve always instilled this value in her (I\u2019m an oldest child myself) but seeing this just made me even more upset, because now it\u2019s just another battle she\u2019s fighting that she shouldn\u2019t be. She\u2019s also just started to figure out that her mom cheated, and over the past couple weeks she started firing tons of questions at me about the timeline of their relationship I couldn\u2019t really answer, and after showing me the recordings, she literally demanded I answer her, yes or no, did her mom cheat on me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I told her the truth, with the promise she wouldn\u2019t tell her sisters (as much it sucks, that\u2019s my job, not hers). The way she cried on my shoulder was the most heartbreaking thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, but she was catching on and I figured if she\u2019s going to find out regardless, it should be in a setting where she\u2019s comfortable. After she was done crying, I told her to email me the recordings she took, and called my cousin.\n\nWe\u2019ve just started the paperwork, but my cousin is certain we can get my ex nailed for parental alienation, and since she got a promotion a few months ago, I should be able to renegotiate the child support payments as well. Most importantly, the recordings should be enough to give me grounds for supervised visits only, which is what I want. I still want the girls to have a relationship with their mom (especially since the younger two still want to see her), I\u2019m just going to have to make sure I\u2019m present at all times when they\u2019re with her. Coparenting is oodles of fun, kids! \n\nAnyway, I also want to give a huge thank you to all the supportive comments and messages. I only saw most of the DMs recently because I use the Reddit is Fun app on my phone and for some reason it doesn\u2019t show chatroom messages. I\u2019m not the best with technology, seeing as my most valuable job skill is herding 5yos, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for any other career. Thanks for all your support, Reddit!",

The post didn\u2019t get a lot of attention but the attention it did get was controversial and there was a lot of differing opinions so I figured I\u2019d do an update as a lot has happened. \n\nSo after I posted I ended up contacting the girlfriends in the group to see what was up and we started noticing some fishy stuff. Their boyfriends and the guys in the group would say the exact same things to them as they did to me. Stuff like we\u2019d invite you but then the other girls will want to come. We also figured out that there were other nights that all the guys were free but that wanted to do Saturday\u2019s for some reason. One of the girls, H, was suspicious for this any many other reasons so she checked her boyfriends phone (I don\u2019t condone what she did at all btw, but in this circumstance I excuse it). While looking she found a group chat called \u201cboys night\u201d which she had never heard of. She was super suspicious at this point and clicked it to be greeted by a bunch of very interesting messages from the boys in our group. \n\nWell guess what? Turns out \u201cguys night\u201d was really \u201cgo to a pub and cheat on your girlfriend night\u201d. The message was in reference to one of the girls my boyfriend was sleeping with last week. In fact, all the other guys except one were cheating, while the other knew but kept quiet. Another lovely discovery from the chat was that he hasn\u2019t been using protection with the other women or with me (birth control), meaning not only has he been cheating he has also been putting me a high risk of an STD, while also risking mine and my elderly grandfathers life because of COVID.\n\nNeedless to say we\u2019ve broken up and I feel better for it, but right now I\u2019m friendless, single and waiting on STD results which doesn\u2019t feel fantastic. \n\nSo yep. Definitely not the update I was hoping to do but life clearly doesn\u2019t turn out the way you plan.\n\nEdit: wow I really was not expecting this response. Thankyou for all the kind words. I\u2019m at work at the moment and will try to respond as much as possible but from the bottom of my heart Thankyou all. And also Thankyou for the award I\u2019m very overwhelmed by all the kindness\n\nEdit 2: Thankyou again for all the kindness- I just thought I\u2019d add a few things. 1. Covid isn\u2019t bad where I am (Aus) but when we hang out we social distance with masks- you can\u2019t social distance during sex which is where my fear of covid comes from 2. One of the girls dumped her boyfriend (who wasn\u2019t cheating but knew) and the other took him back (he was cheating) and finally 3. I\u2019m STD free!!! I got a call an hour ago and am so completely relieved- now I can start to move on.",

His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.\n\n\nI hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this \"vision\" she has for the wedding and how it should be.\n\n\nShe insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that \"she always pictured her son's bride in it\" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her \"vision\" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had \"envisioned\" myself wearing at my wedding!.\n\n\nShe got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and \"turned down\" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked \"what process?\" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that \"both dresses weren't that much different anyway\" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.\n\n\nAnyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress \"a chance\". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a \"vision\" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.\n\n\nMom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and \"go with the flow\" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?\n\nETD Q & As\n\nI'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get.\n\nA. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type.\n\nB. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this \"vision\" has been there for...quite a while.\n\nC. I AM paying for the dress obviously.\n\nD. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son.\n\nE. He's still presisting...",

They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. \n\nI found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling \"the CHICKENS!!!\"). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. \n\nThey all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA?

Matter of fact, she hasn't reached out to either one of us since then (we also didn't reach out to her). Unfortunately, B's words from that day really got to friend A. She struggled with survivors guilt and questioned her upbringing/lifestyle, views on religion, etc. She doubled her therapy sessions and I spent my free time keeping her company.   \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I went over to her place and found her reading a bible and (almost obsessively) flagging pages. She said she was researching to check if what B told her was true. She started reading excerpts and telling me her interpretations. This behavior did scare me a bit, so I suggested she bring this up to her therapist (it was the only thing I could think of to help calm her down). She did talk to the therapist who suggested she perhaps talk to a pastor instead of trying to come up with her own conclusions. She asked me to go with her, which I did, but told me to just wait for her at the church while she talked to the pastor privately. After, she said that she felt better and was more convinced that B was full of it. She also seemed calmer, so I believed that conversation did help her. \n\nI was at her house on Friday and she told me that she still thinks about what was said and, although she feels much better after talking to the pastor, he's only one person and what if he is wrong? I tried to reassure her again and talk through her feelings, but I could tell it was still eating at her. I had a feeling she might spiral again. Then I had an idea. I told her about the post I made on here and explained why, how it works, etc. (she's not a Reddit user). I pulled up my original post and asked her to read the comments to show her how hundreds of people (religious and non-religious) felt about what was said. We spent the evening reading each comment, she cried, she laughed, she was surprised and overwhelmed at the amount of support and reassuring words from all these strangers. I could tell she was more and more relieved as we read. She has been in a much better state of mind since then, so seeing hundreds of people disagree with B's words definitely had a positive impact on her. \n\nSo dear Redditors, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping my friend with your kind words and reassurance! She has a long road ahead of her in this grieving process, but she's going strong.",

She would make noises in between conversations like \"Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop\" and \"Awowo-fwatata\", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. \n\n\nI have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.\n\n\nIt was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:\n\n\n\"Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?\"\n\n\nSeeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. I rolled my eyes and told her:\n\n\n\"I am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. Please excuse me.\" \n\n\nThen I left the restaurant without her. I don't know what occurred to me but I probably shouldn't have done that, but I guess it kinda just snapped. AITA?",

        "text": "My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.\n\nWhen I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was \"cooler\" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like \"fatass\" and \"chubster\". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).\n\nBy the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, \"He's still pretty big\", \"Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness\", \"Maybe lose a little more around that gut\". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.\n\nNow here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, \"Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?\" I flipped out. I yelled, \"Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?\"She said back to me, \"Defensive much?\"  \n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?\" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. \"Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!\" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, \"Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!\"  \n\"But you're way older!\" she whined.\n\nI left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not \"bordering\" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",

I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can\u2019t find out why.\n\nTo answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn\u2019t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it\u2019s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don\u2019t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",

I decided to drive home from work and talk with Erica. When I showed up Leah\u2019s car was parked in the drive. I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn\u2019t then I\u2019m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I\u2019m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said \u201cthose people don\u2019t understand our relationship or Leah\u201d. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she\u2019ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can\u2019t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She\u2019s locked herself in our room now. I\u2019m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn\u2019t know this but her parents said it\u2019s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn\u2019t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn\u2019t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone. Can\u2019t wait to take my clubs out and play a round now that I have more free time. Really excited to see what single life brings and can\u2019t thank you all enough again. \n\n\n\nMe (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don\u2019t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she\u2019s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples\u2026\n\nShe always brings her boyfriend over and he\u2019s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I\u2019m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn\u2019t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn\u2019t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don\u2019t remember\u201d. I told her at this point I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off. \n\nFinal straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I\u2019m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it\u2019s her best friend and that wasn\u2019t fair to do to her in our house. I said it\u2019s a pattern and since Erica\u2019s stuff isn\u2019t affected she doesn\u2019t care. I said she can go over to Leah\u2019s if she wants to see her. She said she can\u2019t do this because Leah doesn\u2019t like her apartment and Leah\u2019s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable. I\u2019m now getting the silent treatment and getting called an AH but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. AITA?",

She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, \u201cWhy? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won\u2019t change that.\u201d She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "So background: I (32f) have a brother, \"Dave\" (35m), who's married to \"Sarah\" (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.\n\nMy sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.\n\nAnyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be \"ignoring my son's obvious speech issues.\" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.\n\nThis really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in \"bad\" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, \"Pass *us* the peas, will you\". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.\n\nEveryone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.\n\nShould I just apologise?\n\n**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**\n\n**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to \"keep the peace\"). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**\n\n**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**\n\n**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",

I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nThis is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/\n\nThis last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \n\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \n\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. Que sera, sera. ",

Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John\u2019s parents AND his childhood best friend \u201cDan\u201d and his wife decided to move here as well.\n\nThis past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a \u201cdistanced picnic\u201d at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to \u201cjokingly\u201d rip on him for being \u201cwhipped\u201d and doing \u201cmy\u201d job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be \u201callowed\u201d to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how \u201cmean\u201d I was for not \u201cfixing him a plate\u201d and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families \"do it right\", where they handle the \u201coutside chores\u201d while their wives handle the \u201cinside chores\u201d (including the care of Dan and his wife\u2019s two children). I think it\u2019s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have \u201coutdoor chores\u201d, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.\n\nThe whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to \u201cgo for a walk\u201d and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for \u201cmaking \\[him\\] look bad\u201d in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how \u201ca traditional division of labor\u201d is \u201ca huge part of southern culture\u201d, and how I was being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his background by \u201cforcing northern culture\u201d onto him and his family. He said he\u2019s been building up a lot of \u201cresentment\u201d the past few months that I \u201cmake\u201d him do half the chores and childcare, since in his \u201cculture\u201d, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.\n\nI was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how \"southern hospitality\" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. \n\nJohn is livid and says his \"culture\" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not \"compromising\" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his \"culture\" was \"Islamic or Asian or whatnot\".",

She does her best to spend as much time with them as she can. but she on the other hand complains that her stepdad tells her to basically take on the role of a babysitter whenever she's with her stepsiblings. My husband denied that and said that my daughter was making up excuses to not have to spend time with his kids.\n\n\nFor this issue, I figured that a family trip is what the family need to get together and spend more time around each others. My husband liked the idea but said that his kids are now \"uncomfortable\" around my daughter because of her \"attitude\" and suggested we let her stay home and have the house all to herself since that's \"what she always wanted\". I told him it's best that we all go. he kept complaing til I snapped and told him to stop\n\n\nI booked (paid) for the whole family. However, my daughter told me she couldn't find her passport. We turned the house upside down looking for it but couldn't find it. My husband said maybe it was a sign from God that we should let her stay home so the trip wouldn't turn into a disaster. I ignored his comment but later while I was cleaning his office I found the passport, tucked away in the 3rd drawer under a ton of papers. I was floored by this, I confronted him with it and he swore he had no idea why or how the passport got there. I checked the upstairs camera and saw him enter my daughter's room. That was it for me, I screamed my head off at him then cancelled the whole trip completely. He started arguing saying I overreacted and that he didn't want his kids to be \"miserable\" on the trip and that willing to apologize to my daughter if and *when* I reconsider my decision regarding the cancellation of the trip, because my stepkids will be devastated but I said it was final and that it was done.\n\n\nHe become cold and distant and said that he wants to take some time to do some fasting and get guidance from God about how he should deal with the disrespect and control I had displayed lately.\n\n\nAITA for cancelling it altogether?",

She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. \n\nIt sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.\n\nI found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.\n\n\"No photos\" \"no videos\" \"i do not consent to be photographed\" \"no means no\" \"respect my privacy\" \"no cameras\" \"no profiting off my image\"\n\nIt sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.\n\nAnd I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.\n\nMy mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking\n\nBut I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.\n\nAnd I'm always like \"no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. \n\nI am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.\n\nI know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.\n\nEdit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and \"no means no\" and \"this body is my own\" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a \"gangster hoody\". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree\n\nAITA for always wearing my no photos hoodie?",

We're talking about making it a home for both of us.\n\nBut as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. \n\nWhen his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. \n\nWhen I am bothered, she's like \"I was just helping with chores\" etc. He says I should just let her because she has \"a lot of nervous energy\" \n\nOne thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little \"affirmation\" post it note on my monitor saying \"I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things\" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. \n\nAnyway, she made a comment to about my ego... \n\nBut as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of \"affirmations\" to hide.\n\nSome were:\n\nMedicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!\n\nKitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!\n\nWork desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! \n\nWalk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!\n\n\nThere were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. \n\nNext time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. \n\nI went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. \n\nHe asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? \n\nHe said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.\n\nI was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit\"\n\nHe asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.\n\nHe said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!\n\nAITA for the note prank?",

We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. \n\nWe always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. \n\nWe were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. \n\nWe decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. \n\nTurns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. \n\nI\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ?\n\nHi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i\u2019ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I\u2019ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fianc\u00e9 bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they\u2019re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I\u2019d mail the ring but as for me and her, we\u2019re done and to tell my parents the same. I\u2019m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don\u2019t turn to a bottle again and go off again.",

        "text": "I\u2019m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I\u2019ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there\u2019s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.\n\nShe exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.\n\nAfter her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She\u2019s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide \u201cThe Rules\u201d like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who\u2019s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.\n\nBut I doubt she loves him. We\u2019ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been open with me that she doesn\u2019t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt \u201cpretty neutral\u201d about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she\u2019s ever done, and doesn\u2019t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.\n\nHer boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she\u2019s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it\u2019ll scare him away. I\u2019ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sabotage my daughter\u2019s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend\u2019s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won\u2019t end the relationship. It\u2019s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he\u2019s bound to find out she\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d; it can\u2019t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",

I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.\n\nMy wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. \n\nHe said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. \n\nWell, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",

Unfortunately, I'm wrong.\n\nI gave my oldest two weeks to really think about whether he wanted to talk to my sister or not. I figured that the decision he made at first might have been made out of anger, so I wanted to give him time to make such an important decision.\n\nUltimately, he decided that he did actually want to talk to her. I have to admit I was a little bit surprised, but we set up a zoom call between them anyway (of course with me supervising). Right before the zoom call he admitted to me that he wanted to talk to her, \"Just to see if she'll say sorry,\".\n\nShe did not say sorry.\n\nActually she opened the call with, \"Hello! It's been so long! I guess you're ready come home with me now?\", and then she noticed that I was sitting there with him, and almost immediately launched into accusations about \"alienation\" and how I \"have to give the kids back now or she'll call the police and say I kidnapped them,\". My oldest was very obviously disgusted. He asked her if she was going to apologize to him, and she actually had the audacity to ask what she had to apologize for.\n\nAt that point, he just shut off the zoom call. I asked him if he was okay, but he spent the rest of the afternoon in his room by himself.\n\nThat night he told me that he never wanted to talk to her again, ever. I told him that never is a long time, but that we weren't going to make him talk to her if he didn't want to, and we were never, ever going to give him back to her.\n\nHe told me that never is a long time. We told him that in this case, it meant never.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still shocked. I don't know what happened to my sister. She was my best friend as a kid. She was almost my second mother. She was sweet and caring and nice, I just don't know how all that changed so fast. Or maybe it didn't change that fast and I just never noticed until it was too late and I was driving four hours away at midnight to pick up three little kids, one of which I didn't even know existed.\n\nBefore now, I honestly never considered myself as their parent, even after I legally adopted them. More like I was just taking care of them long term. But now I realize that those kids are my kids. And they're going to be my kids for the rest of my (and hopefully their) lives.\n\nThank you for all of your help, guys. I hope you all have a fantastic day.",

        "text": "I 23 am the oldest of five siblings and I am a full time student. I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  \n\nBoth of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  \n\nMy dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  \n\nOver Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  \n\nMy parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  \n\nI went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  \n\nI packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  \n\nI'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  \n\nI just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  \n\nMy oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  \n\nMy parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  \n\nI'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    \n\nI feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.\n\n#EDIT\n\nAll the chores were split fairly.  I wasn't doing any more than anyone else.  I thought it was fair until I was asked to out in money as well.",

I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say \"OK I get it\" and \"I won't do it again\".\n\nDays ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.\n\nHours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\nHe pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.\n\nNote: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.",

I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.\n\nDad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.\n\nWhen I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.\n\nIn 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.\n\nDad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.\n\nAITA?",

I gave him $20.)  \n\nAs I suspected, Steve confirmed that he wasn\u2019t approached all night, nobody could tell he wasn\u2019t me, and he admitted he even felt excluded and he could only imagine how I felt. \n\nSo this morning on Christmas I invited Steve to join (normally he\u2019s with my mom and dad every year as he\u2019s not married or in a relationship.) they know about him obviously but didn\u2019t know about the switcheroo. That was when I revealed that last night \u201cI\u201d was Steve and expressed disappointment that nobody noticed and said this is why I stopped trying, nobody talks to me. \n\nMy wife drew the line here, she was hoping we would keep this between the two of us as a funny prank.

I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**\n\nA while ago my daughter\\[8f\\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have\n\nEDIT: we live in the deep south",

I don't live close to any of my family and don't post on social media so my family wasn't really aware of my weight loss. I did mention that I was making healthier choices but that's it. It's just that every time before that I've tried to lose weight it hasn't worked out so I didn't want anyone commenting on it.\n\nMy sister 26F got engaged last year and I'm super happy for her. Due to circumstances, the wedding had to be pushed back a little. It's happening a week from now and because I haven't seen everyone in so long I decided to come down two weeks earlier to help out and catch up. Well, when I came to see my family my sister freaked out upon seeing me. As it turns out she has gained a bit of weight not super noticeable to me she still looks great. But I think this is the first time in our lives that I'm smaller than her I've always been the \"fat sister\". She basically accused me of trying to upstage her and my parents are fully taking her side. I'm really not sure if I'm in the wrong here as so many of my family are taking her side of things.\n\nAITA for losing weight before my sister's wedding?",

She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just \"harmless teasing\".\n\n\nMy husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.\n\n\n\nWe went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just \"kids teasing each other\" and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.",

It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead. \n\nI got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well). \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. \n\nAt first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. \n\nI started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. \n\nI told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?",

My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.\n\nMy husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.\n\nEventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. \n\nI filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?",

And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. \n\nIt hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me \u201ckilling\u201d her and he can\u2019t stand to look at my face. \n\nYou can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That\u2019s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. \n\nMy aunt doesn\u2019t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that\u2019s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn\u2019t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It\u2019s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason about why we\u2019re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. \n\nBut he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of \u201clife stuff.\u201d It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. \n\nI told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma\u2019s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it\u2019s been put in jeopardy. \n\nMy dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn\u2019t agree at all with what he did and it could\u2019ve been avoided if I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nFor me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn\u2019t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",

        "text": "Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. \n\nTen years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. \n\nSo here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. \n\nSo recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",

Am i the asshole in this situation?\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nwell guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn\u2019t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon\n\n\n\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\n\nHello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So\u2026 the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to \u201cappreciate the gays\u201d. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! \nPs: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey\u2019s name, won\u2019t happen again lol",

They were understanding and setup a family meeting with them, their lawyer, my dad, his wife, and myself.\n\nI was secretly hoping that my grandparents would get over some of their issues with my dad and his wife but nope. My dad's wife actually started crying and wailing when they revealed that I would be getting most of the inheritance. I could see my grandmother almost exploding. My dad to his credit, looked disappointed but said it was their money to do as they wished.\n\nThe new agreement is that my father will receive $75k, and each of my younger siblings will receive a 50K education fund.\n\nMy dad's wife did call me a few days later and acted really foolishly. And she somehow thought that insulting my mother would help her.\n\nI told her that if she ever said something bad about my mother again I would tell my grandparents about it. That seems to have shut her up.\n\nMy relationship with my dad was never the greatest. But I haven't really seen any further decline in the relationship.\n\nBut I feel a lot of relief now.

        "text": "I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.\n\nWe didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.\n\nSo my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.\n\nI visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is \u00a3500k and she needs a \u00a3150k deposit. She has \u00a3100k so far. \u00a325k on her own, \u00a325k from her mum and \u00a350k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra \u00a350k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.\n\nI said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave \u00a310k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back \"like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?\"\n\nEveryone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.\n\nMy mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about.

I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M. \n\nI have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter \"the house will be yours\" nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to?\n\nOne important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist.\n\nMy fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split. \n\nI spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her.",

So thanks to everyone who told me what I desperately needed to hear. \n\nI started gathering evidence which would allow me to leave relatively savely. After I had enough evidence I prepared to leave. I gathered all documents and secretly packed up some stuff for the kids and myself. I informed my parents and my brother about the situation. My parents immediately turned my brother's old room into the new kids room and my old room has never stopped being mine. I waited for my husband to be gone and then my brother picked us all up. \n\nI left a message for my husband explaining that I wasn't coming back and that I'd be filing for divorce. I also told him about all the evidence so he wouldn't do anything stupid. \n\nI've been at my parents' for nearly a week now. We have a carer who stays here 3 nights a week and I share the other 4 nights with both my parents. My dad is retired so he looks after the kids for a good portion of the day. \n\nI have talked to a lawyer and she said I will likely get full custody. \nMy soon to be ex has left some nasty messages but hasn't shown up so I feel relatively safe. I don't think he will fight for custody since he was always disappointed that our daughter wasn't a son and our son isn't the strong little boy that he wanted either. \n\nAs of now I will stay with my parents. The kids are happy, my parents are happy and I had 7 hours of sleep last night.",

My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. \n\nMy sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn\u2019t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.\n\nYesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.\n\nI asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a \u201cstupid baby toy\u201d and that he saw people break them online. \n\nMy sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.\n\nShe laughed and said no. She says I shouldn\u2019t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. \n\nSeeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.\n\nMy sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn\u2019t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won\u2019t miss it. I than told them to leave.\n\nMy nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.\n\nOther family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don\u2019t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don\u2019t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.\n\nThey all think I should buy another new system for him but I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I\u2019m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",

We got married in the fall of 2018, so it\u2019s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.\n\nMy whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. \nIn college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. \n\nDuring visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren\u2019t married we weren\u2019t allowed to share a bed. We didn\u2019t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.\n\nDuring Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.\n\nThe 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. \n\nThey snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband\u2019s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That\u2019s when I saw red. \n\nI started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn\u2019t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house \u2014 that was still in my parents\u2019 name.\n\nMy bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in \u201ctheir\u201d house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn\u2019t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.\n\nThe kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.\n\nI told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.\n\nI want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",

        "text": "I was asked to be a member of the wedding party. Despite this, I was THE ONLY person, not only in the wedding party, but also at the ceremony, who wasn't allowed to have a +1. This was an outdoor wedding with unlimited seating and these people don't give a shit about COVID so it wasn't about that.   \n\n\nI was told it was because my relationship wasn't \"serious\" enough despite us being together for a year. That only engaged or married couples were invited. And that they didn't want \"some random guy\" in their wedding pictures who \"I might not even be with\" later in the future. They don't want to \"have to look at some random guy in their pictures\" even though he wouldn't have been in any of the posed pictures at all. Maybe just in the background of crowd shots.  \n\n\nThere have been NO conflicts between them and my boyfriend and he's a nice and mild-mannered guy who gets along with everyone so I don't think it was about him personally.   \n\n\nI get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.   \n\n\nThis is when I started feeling surly. I smiled and played my part during the ceremony but inside I was very surly and angry.   \n\n\nWe then got to the reception which had way more people than the ceremony. This is where all the \"more distant friends\" were invited. AND EVERYONE THERE had a +1. I was literally placed at a table as the one single person and everyone else at the table was a couple. Some at the table were other members of the wedding party, but others were random distant acquaintances. People started asking me where my boyfriend was and I said I was told he wasn't invited. They asked why and I said I had no idea why. This is when I started letting my surliness show and started acting rude and mean, because I was humiliated.   \n\n\nAND THEN, I was \"brought into conversation\" with the couple's male friend, Dean. I was previously told that Dean has a crush on me and I made it clear I wouldn't be interested even if I were single. Even after that he kept trying to message me and I ignored him. But now the people who \"brought me into conversation\" with Dean were like standing around staring at us and giggling behind their hands. Like they thought they were Cupid matchmakers. Dean was absolutely a participant in this  \n\n\nI was meaner to Dean than I've ever been to anyone in my entire life. I was as fully rude as I've ever wanted to be when being the target of someone's romantic interest unwantedly. It's true I don't really know if I was being set up but I was already furious before that happened. Everyone was silent and awkward.  \n\n\nI went back and finished my meal, and as soon as I was done, picked up my purse and left and went straight to my boyfriend's house, skipping most of the reception, cake cutting, speeches, and everything.   \n\n\nI'm now being told by the couple that they're \"hurt and confused\" why I left so early. I haven't replied.",

        "text": "I (32f) am getting married to my fianc\u00b4\u00e9 (41m) next year. After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fianc\u00e9's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family).\n\nAnyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fianc\u00e9's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, \"It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once.\" and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset.\n\nIn response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the \"wedding colour\", to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable \u2013 and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.\n\nMy niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fianc\u00e9 to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy. \n\nAITA for trying to overrule her parents?",

        "text": "My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say \"No\" to things she feels uncomfortable with.\n\nThere is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.\n\nMy daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. \n\nHe said no because the teacher had said \"about\" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that \"you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules\" and she said she didn't care. \n\nI heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.\n\nBut then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. \n\nI sent her an email saying..\n\nDear Mrs. (Teacher)\n\nI'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. \n\nShe's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.\n\nI understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.\n\nI think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her \"No\" and stepping out of the situation.\n\nI hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the \"Include everyone\" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say \"No\" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. \n\nThank you,\n\nOP\n\nShe emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh\n\nAITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?\n\n////\n\nEdit to update...\n\nI reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. \n\nI ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. \n\nWe all presented a united front asking for the following...\n\nThe school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be \"nice\". Instead of \"Include everyone\" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. \n\nWe went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.\n\nThanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",

I moved her hand away and we went to the principal.

        "text": "Last week a new colleague \"Cathy\" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far \"exotic\" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.\n\nCathy then jokes about how all this \"no travel business\" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was \"at a native speaker level\" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.\n\nI was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy \"oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!\" (\"oh fun, we have something in common then!\")\n\nShe immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she \"couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it.\" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.\n\nShe got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added \"which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!\" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said \"whatever\" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.\n\nHowever, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting \"superior\" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a \"little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues\" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have \"witnesses\" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. \n\nEdit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an \"exotic\" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know \"exotic\" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. \n\nEdit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft \"g\" lol.) ",

        "text": "My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep.\n\n\nMy husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that \ud83d\ude09) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said \"NO\" because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's \"homemade\". I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is.\n\nOnce I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it \"appropriate\" to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they \"missed\" out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their \"traditional feasts\" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family.\n\nI understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese?\n\n\nEDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely.\n\nCome on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",

A couple hours after I posted it, I realized I left a lot of information out and wanted to clarify some things, as well as provide an update on the situation.\n\nSome people asked if I pay rent or own the house. It's my parents house, and I don't pay rent. I can't afford to move out right now, and my parents don't want to let me move out until after my first year of uni. \n\nSome people also asked if I'm autistic. I have ADHD, which shares a lot of traits with autism. I stick to a strict routine because it's the only way I'm able to remember to do everything I need to in the morning. \n\nA lot of people suggested packing my lunch at a different time, or even the night before. I had tried this before; no matter what time I went into the kitchen, my mom followed. I tried it again a couple times since making the post, and she continued to follow me.\n\nI took the advice of some people who told me to try going into the kitchen as usual, but to leave when my mom got in my way and tell her I'd wait until she was finished. I even made sure the kitchen was spotless the night before. Dishwasher emptied, no dishes in the sink, counters wiped down, and trash emptied. She followed me in, and when I said I'd wait, she said she was done. Almost as soon as I went back in, she followed me in again and claimed she had forgotten to do something. \n\nA lot of people pointed out that she might just want to spend time with me, which I hadn't thought of before. I think that maybe me getting a job, finishing high school, and starting to work towards getting my driver's license made her realize I'm growing up and won't be dependent on her/living at home for much longer. Maybe she just wants to spend as much time with me as she can before I go, or maybe she doesn't feel as \"Mom\" as she did before. \n\nWhat finally worked was, after dinner a couple nights ago, asking her to pack some leftovers from dinner in a separate container for me to take for lunch the next day. She seemed really happy that I asked, and didn't follow me into the kitchen the next morning. She even left a sticky note with a smiley face on top of the container! I also asked if she could drive me to work, which gave us the chance to chat and catch up in the car. \n\nI think she just missed feeling like I need her, which I always will. Even though we butt heads sometimes, she'll always be my mom, and I think I just needed to find a way to remind her of that. \n\nI wrote my original post feeling super frustrated at my mom, but I teared up a bit finishing this update. Sending a massive thank you to all the kind people who commented and helped me work this out :)",

Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a \"responsible adult\" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn\u2019t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.\n\nBri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.\n\nI don\u2019t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.\n\nlong story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn\u2019t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don\u2019t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn\u2019t go into detail about.\n\nIt's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.\n\nAITA??",

        "text": "I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.\n\n\nSo I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.\n\n\nLately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.\n\n\n\nThursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) \"borrowed\" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. \n\n\nBut he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?\n\n\n\n\nEdit: holy shitballs this blew up!\n\n\n\nI *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. \n\n\n\nMy coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?\n\n\n\nTo answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.\n\n\n\nI'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.\n\n\n\nSuing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.\n\n\nAnd for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: the recipe\n\n\n\n\n2 tbsp red curry paste \n3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter\n1/4 cup sugar\n2 tsp dark soy sauce\n2 tbsp cider vinegar\n3/4 cup of water\n12 oz of coconut milk\n\n\nI cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo\n\n\n\nI had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new\n\n\nAnd the natural pb is important! Nuttier, stronger and far less sugar",

Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.\n\nConnor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it\u2019d be fun to act like college students again.\n\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement \u201cNever Have I Ever cheated before\u201d came up.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fianc\u00e9 cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my \u201cboyfriend\u201d of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).\n\nWell my brother knows about this so when I didn\u2019t drink, he went \u201chey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex\u2019s name*). You have to drink to that!\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t any of it and ended things on the spot. I\u2019m numb. I\u2019m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on.\n\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn\u2019t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn\u2019t think when he said those words. I just can\u2019t look at him right now. He ruined my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt. Am I being unreasonable?",

        "text": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c5lpau/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_that_i_am_dying/)\n\nHey all. I wasn't sure if I was going to make this update, but things are getting gloomier, and I feel that I owe you guys the closure you deserve, for all the help you gave me (as well as the multiple news stories lol). Although I didn't respond much, due to everything being so new and overwhelming, I want each of you to know that I read every single comment and message, multiple times, over the past year and a half.\n\nI did end up telling my wife, soon after my post. She took it rough, as expected. It ruined me to see her that way, but I knew that I needed to tell her. She did enjoy reading through the original thread though, as many of you had heartwarming thoughts and messages. We took the time that we needed to ensure that she would be setup as best as possible. Following that, we went and spent the best 4 months of my life in Australia. The experience was amazing, and I couldn't have asked for a better dying wish.\n\nWe came back just in time for COVID. Honestly, I was scared to death (and still am), but somehow I've lasted this long. I've lost much of my strength, and hospice has come in to setup the house and ensure that I am comfortable enough to die. I had thought that I would be dead by now, so it is hard to complain about getting a little extra time.\n\nI've left a large collection of greeting cards in possession with a friend-- birthday's, first anniversary without me, remarriage, children's birth and birthdays (if she uses my sperm). I didn't tell her about any of these, just because some of these events aren't guaranteed. But I know that they can help if the time comes around.\n\nOverall, I'm content (about as content as I can be). There's a lot of things I would have done differently in life if I had known this would happen, but that's unfortunately out of my control. However, I do know that I did the most I could have done with the remaining time I was given. I am just glad that I had time left while I still had my health, as I know that many aren't as lucky.\n\nThanks again for all of your help. I'll answer any questions you guys have, so long as it isn't personally identifiable (which includes my medical information, as my town paper was thoughtful enough to write an article about me). Just be patient please; even typing for long periods of time gets painful.",

        "text": "I have big boobs. I\u2019m currently at 52kg and there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I\u2019m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. \n\nMy friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She\u2019s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I\u2019m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. \n\nSarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they\u2019re a physical feature I\u2019m uncomfortable with but doesn\u2019t let up. Examples of things she\u2019ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they\u2019ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she\u2019ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my \u2018cartoon boobs\u2019. I know she\u2019s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I\u2019ve told her a few times to drop it before. \n\nNow we\u2019re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *\u2018Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you\u2019re in a porno. We don\u2019t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.\u2019* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven\u2019t spoken again. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I\u2019m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah\u2019s been telling everyone that it\u2019s ME that\u2019s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I\u2019ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don\u2019t even understand the stupid \u2018boy body\u2019 insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she\u2019s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn\u2019t sure at first but fuck it, I\u2019m reporting her. I don\u2019t know why I ever considered her a friend, she\u2019s fucking mental and annoying.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn\u2019t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn\u2019t).\n\nI\u2019ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don\u2019t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I\u2019ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I\u2019m stupidly shy?)\n\nMy head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.\n\n\n**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I\u2019ve seen:\n\n- I\u2019ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I\u2019m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.\n\n- My breasts alone aren\u2019t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can\u2019t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won\u2019t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People\u2019s comments don\u2019t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.\n\n- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.\n\n- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.\n\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nThe coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. \n\nI have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It\u2019s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don\u2019t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I\u2019m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don\u2019t directly work with one another but it doesn\u2019t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn\u2019t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. \n\nI don\u2019t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don\u2019t ever have to interact with one another, I\u2019m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don\u2019t care.\n\n\n**Last Update:**\n\nI\u2019m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I\u2019ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don\u2019t need this misery in my life. If she\u2019s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. \n\nIf I don\u2019t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",

        "text": "My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I\u2019ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I\u2019ve always been supportive of him and his identity. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son \u2013 at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I\u2019ve gotten to know him really well. However my fianc\u00e9 told me recently that she does not want my son\u2019s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He\u2019s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic \u2013 that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It\u2019s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. \n\nAfter that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn\u2019t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here \u2013 that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it\u2019s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his \u201cstep grandparents\u201d in the future anyway. I still don\u2019t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",

I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.\n\nHe (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.",

        "text": "This is a shitty situation but here we go. \n\nMe and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because \"oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone\". \n\nI stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. \n\nAnya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. \n\nFew months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. \n\nA week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. \n\nSince then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. \n\nLater that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. \n\nI was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the \"She is my daughter, not yours\" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. \n\nWhether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. \n\nOf course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. \n\nBoth of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?",

        "text": "Hello reddit. It has been a couple months since my last post and so much has happened. [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/m47ual/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_husband_for_using_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nI first want to thank EVERYONE who reached out and snapped me out of this daze with my SOON TO BE EX! He was extremely toxic and just made me feel not even worth anything. Thus probably why it was so hard to see he wasn't it. So I want to thank everyone who offered words of encouragement and even the tough love. I needed to hear it.\n\nAfter he went back to his parents he was waiting for my apology (which I never did) and when he noticed I drained our joint bank he escalated saying I was his and how I could never actually leave him and that he \"owned\" me, all of my success was his and without him I would a loser drop out. His family was even worse because I had already blocked them so they started making fake accounts and using apps to hide their number to harass me. Saying I ruined their sons life and how he sacrificed everything to get me where I am to throw him to the side like this was disgusting and I deserve to rot.\n\nI provided all this to my lawyer who recommended I take a restraining order (in case he wanted to escalate further) and to not engage EVER but just keep the records. This has caused my anxiety to go through the roof and I am working on this with my therapist. I have separated the finances completely and changed my banks, even told them my stbx is NEVER allowed to access these accounts because he would take it all and run. I have changed my number and gone completely social media less(besides this). Part of me is broken that our marriage came to end over a computer. I keep thinking I am stupid and how I couldn't see the warning signs. I must look like a fool to everyone. All in all I'm slowly picking up the pieces of my life and figuring out how to move forward. Thank you to anyone still reading this and thank you everyone who helped me get here.\n\nSummary: I am officially filing for divorce after I never apologized to him which only made my soon to be ex-husband and his family started harassing me to the nth degree. I was having a panic attack everytime the phone rang so I had to change my number and delete any social media. I am gaining my freedom from my toxic partner and his family.",

        "text": "\n\nHello! \n\nI f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.\n\n\n\nThe day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.\n\n\nBefore I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. \n\nThey didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.\n\n\nI went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of \"teaching me a lesson\" was not right.",

I had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. When I was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. I had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.\n\nFive years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. My mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. My father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. Obviously my family is morning, and I've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.\n\nThe only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and I'm not going to let that happen. I told my wife that I was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. She did not take it well and is furious that I would choose my brother over her. I doubt my marriage will survive, but I can't let my brother go into foster care.\n\nEDIT: LC",

I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.\n\nAnyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they\u2019re cutting capacity by half. As a result she\u2019s sending out \u201cre-invites\u201d that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she\u2019s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word \u201cessays\u201d to two questions. The gist is that they\u2019ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people\u2019s enthusiasm. People who don\u2019t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.\n\nI just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren\u2019t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like \u201dwhy do you still want to celebrate this day with us?\u201d And \u201cwhat will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?\u201d So she\u2019s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. \n\nAnyways I told her in advance I\u2019m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She\u2019s said that to keep things fair if I don\u2019t fill out the RSVP correctly I won\u2019t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don\u2019t show up I\u2019m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. \n\nAITA if I stay stubborn on this? I\u2019m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 27F. I don\u2019t live with family but she is my only sister.\n\nEdit2: Sister has framed these essays as \u201csurveys\u201d but there\u2019s a word limit requirement so if you don\u2019t reach it on the google forms you can\u2019t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.",

Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only \"friend\" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\\*\\*\\*\\* and a c\\*\\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\\*\\*\\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.\n\nAITA for not wanting to forgive him??",

I had no problem with that.\n\nThis happened before we found out the gender of the baby - my husband and his family had me \"do things\" like attend prayers and do other rituals before the reveal at the drs. I didn't like that but went with it to keep the peace.\n\nDr appoitment came, and it turned out to be a girl. My husband cried in the car then turned his phone off to hide from his family then finally told them. His mom and the others made their frustration & disapppintment clear which bothered me cause my daughter deserves to be celebrated but, they ghosted me for days then started coming over & visiting constantly referring to my daughter as my son claiming the results were false and basically pretending it's a boy. I had severa fights with them after they refused to stop it, and my husband sided with them despite seeing how wrong and unreasonable what they were doing was. We didn't speak for a while\n\nSister InLaw called to apologize then inform me she arranged for a babyshower for me. I was so excited and happy. But when I arrived I saw blue balloons, blue cake with Father InLaw's name/decorations around. I was so confused I had to sit down. Sister InLaw explained they were \"still\" hoping the gender results are false and it's a boy. I looked at my husband and he agreed with her. I lost my temper and yelled at them all calling them delusionals and telling them to stop treating my daughter like she's unwanted and act like she doesn't exist by throwing a party for \"their imaginary grandson\". mother InLaw break down crying, I took my bag and walked out immediately.\n\nThey started yelling and my husband followed me outside and started arguing about how I insulted his family, and his dads memory by acting like that. I told him to wake up and see the insanity in his family's behavior. He said they needed time to process the fact that it's a girl not a boy as they expected and insisted I play along and \"they'll soon get over it\". I said absolutely not and demanded he take me home, he said no so I called an Uber and left. He was fuming he called 15 times, then texted that he won't be coming home til I \"get my ass\" over and apologize for ruining everything THEY'VE DONE FOR ME and accusing them of being mentally unstable. I haven't responded yet he's constantly pressuring me to get right with his family before we even talk about anything else.",

I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.\n\nAs soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.\n\nThis released an even bigger tirade and series of \"what the fuck is your problem\"-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her \"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now\". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.\n\nI noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.",

        "text": " \n\nI (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to \"brunch\" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.\n\nOn Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying \"Hey, I'm staying out until x time\", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed.\n\nI am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed.\n\nThe next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again. She asked if her potentially losing her kids was worth me being petty.",

        "text": "Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. \n\nAnyway:\n\nI did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\".\n\nI've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.\n\nThey didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn\u2019t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don\u2019t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.\n\nI raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their \u201csilly joke\u201c. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It\u2019s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.\n\nI now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?\n\nedit: grammer",

She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I\u2019ve watched these kids grow up, I\u2019ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they\u2019ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.\n\nMy brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fianc\u00e9 Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there\u2019s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn\u2019t belong.\nMy brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop\u2014 the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.\n\nThe kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.\nIvan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.\n\nMy kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn\u2019t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.\n\nSara spoke up and said \u201coh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.\u201d\n\nMy dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children.\n\nMy wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine.\n\nI left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.\n\nMy brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving.\n\nI haven\u2019t replied back. I meant what I said, but I\u2019m worried that maybe I\u2019m reacting too harshly.\n\nETA INFO:\n\nI adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents \"step grandchildren\". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.\n\nEdit no.2:\n\n- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.\n- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.\n- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",

Llamas spit in self-defense.\" But they kind of laughed my warning off.\n\nNow, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.\n\nThe llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a \"warning spit\" (just saliva) and they went \"eww\" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.\n\nFinally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.\n\nTo make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.\n\nAITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",

So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. \n\nWhile it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.\n\nSo that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, \"what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?\" Without a thought I said, \"same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table\". \n\nLong story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end \"dogs aren't comparable to humans\". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",

I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting.\n\nI have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house.\n\nLater in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se.\n\nSean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.",

She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like \"I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children\".  \n\n\nNow that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. \n\nWell, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a \"healthy marriage\". But its my daughter's happiness that matters. AITA?",

        "text": "I\u2019ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he\u2019s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he\u2019s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it\u2019s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. \n\nI know exactly the reason why and it\u2019s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who\u2019s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. \n\nSo I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like \u201cyou are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I\u2019m just being honest and you can\u2019t accept it.\u201d This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. \n\nAnyways when he asked me I basically said, \u201clisten the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.\u201d I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he\u2019s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can\u2019t control. \n\nNow I\u2019m in hot water for \u201cruining his confidence\u201d and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh? AITA for telling him what I said?",

Or cut all the roses off her bushes because they were too cheap to buy from the florist I guess.\n\nAnyway my dash cam of my car which I park in the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of them close up and as a way to help my mom not have her plants stolen I printed all their pictures out and made a poster that said \n\n\"Oh Hay there! Don't be a Daffy-dil and steal, or else you might end up doing hard Thyme! We hope Thistle be a lesson to Yew! \n\nAnd I put the pictures of everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a funny fake name : \"mr potato head\" \"dill-a-tante\" \"pothead\" \"prick\" 'Succ-er\" \" i peony in my pants\" \"frond-less\" 'dirt-bag' 'in-fertile\" and \"root boy\" \n\n. I thought it was funny and cutesy, like how can you be offended with dumb plant puns... My mom thought it was hilarious and wanted me to hang it up because she was sick of seeing stuff stolen \n\nBut I got a couple complains, one neighbor said I needed to take it down because I had a picture of his son a minor who did something dumb yes but was just trying to bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that is was disproportionate and rude to publicly shame him.\n\nI told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty.\n\nAnother guy came to the house and returned a cutting his wife apparently tookbto propogate thinking it would be no big deal... But yeah it damaged the plant because she cut like a quarter off. And he asked if we'd take down the sign because she was on the board of directors or something from the town and whatever. My mom had answered the door and told him to make like a bee and buzz off. \n\nAnyway I guess they both know each other and now both these familys are annoyed. \n\nAITA for making a petty sign about people stealing from my mom's garden?

They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. \n\nSo the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. Obviously there's no way I could have known this.\n\nI'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there.

I am thankful to each and everyone of you to give me such beautiful and encouraging messages. These kept me going, no joke.\u00a0\n\n\nTippy was found 2 miles away from our house, a day after I posted ads and posters on several platforms and websites. A kind lady living alone had found him near her street, starving and exhausted. She responded to my calls for help on Facebook and I am utterly thankful to her. We need more people like her in this world :')\u00a0\n\n\nMy son and Tippy are both ecstatic to be reunited, he takes care of him just like he did before, only now I have some time on my hands to help him as well. However, my son is still wary of his father and he'll likely remain so for a long time. Now he doesn't ask him for help at all.\u00a0\n\n\nAs for my husband, he now treats Tippy as if he doesn't exist. He went and bought a new xbox controller right after Tippy was brought back and now demands that I pay him for damaging his property. I am willing to pay because I realise my impulsive response was not the best decision and nor was it the best way to deal with my situation. My approach towards my husband's Xbox and my husband's approach towards Tippy were both horrible and irrational.\u00a0\n\n\nMany of you mentioned that my husband may have been neglecting our daughter. It's unfortunate that you were right.\u00a0\n\n\nI started to notice some tender area and red skin around my daughter's diaper area around 2 weeks ago. She was uncomfortable, irritable and put up a fuss every time I tried to change her diaper. Turns out she was suffering from a diaper rash.\u00a0\n\n\nDiaper rashes can occur for a variety of reasons, none of which were applying to my daughter. She wasn't on antibiotics, she had soft cotton clothes, her bowel movements were normal and we weren't using any new products on her. This left only one option. Her diapers weren't being changed frequently. I was away from home for 5 days. I asked my husband how many times he had changed her diapers.\u00a0\n\n\nA baby her age needs her diaper changed at least once every 3 hours. My husband outright said he was changing them every 7 hours or so for those 5 days because he didn't think that they needed to be changed as much as before because she was now 6 months old. He had raised a son with me before, it's a ridiculous excuse.\u00a0\n\n\nThe diaper rash is gone now, but now I am scared to ever leave my baby with him when I go to work. I will have to sit down and reconsider everything and have a long talk with him soon. It's inevitable. He still plays Xbox just like he used to play before.\n\n\nI will never forget how a bunch of strangers jumped to help me find our dog. Thank you, you lovely people. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Please check out my account for a beautiful and heartwarming message I just recieved :)",

I have a16 year old son 'Daniel' and I recently got engaged to my fiancee of 2 years.\nHer mom and I aren't on good terms because of how she behaves. She's a controlling, self-centered, Dolly parton wanna be. I learn to ignore her crap but she's been annoying Daniel and criticizing his personality regularly (he's a private kid and still hasn't gotten used to the new family dynamic but he's in therapy and is doing fine) she keeps diagnosing him left and right calling him anti-social, autistic and other crap.\n\nFact is, Daniel is a shy, well manared kid but people confuse that with being \"anti-social\".\nMIL tried several time to force Daniel to \"open up\" by embarrassing him with personal questions on family dinners and \"test\" his personality type.\n\nI've realized the effect her behavior had on Daniel so I gave him the choice to no longer be in the same room/house as MIL and he appreciated this alot. MIL didn't like that Daniel kept his distance and no longer visits and kept bitching about how spoiled he will become for her daughter to deal with. I told her to stop bringing it up but she cried \"I'm just doing this for Daaannny;\"\n\n\nLast week she visited unexpectedly wanting to say hi to Daniel. After Daniel greeted her he went into the bathroom and she went into the livingroom with my fiancee.\nI was in my bedroom when Daniel came and said his journal was gone. We looked for it but didn't find it. I asked my fiancee who was alone in the kitchen but didn't see it. I paused for a second to ask where MIL was, My fiancee said in the living room but I saw her coming down the stairs. I asked where she was, she said the bathroom. I saw her purse in hand so I bluntly asked if she took Daniel's journal. She looked offended and called for my fiancee when I insisted to see inside her purse. She wanted to leave but I didn't let her. Fiancee told me to stop it but I insisted and the journal was there. MIL tried to explain this was her only chance to get to know Daniel better because \"she cares about him\". I blew up at her and berated her for stealing from my son and told her she's banned from my house for the stunt she pulled. she argued with me then left.\nMy fiancee apologized for her but said banning her from the house was over the top.\nIt backlashed and and FIL argued and hoped his daughter realizes how f///ing ab///ve I am and call off the wedding for refusing to apologize to MIL. Fiancee said her family won't come to the wedding til I reconcile with her mom and cancel the ban but I won't let my son be disrespected in his own house and asked my fiancee to understand. I'm refusing to reconcile but am aware this could ruin my relationship with all my inlaws not just MIL and my fiancee thinks I'm selfish to cause drama.",

The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. \n\n3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said \"neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it.\" She decided to leave. Again, I am being told I am childish. AITA?",

        "text": "\nThis has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.\n\nI M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.\n\nDespite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.\n\nI started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.\n\nHe never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. \n\nLast week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this \"opportunity\" away to someone else.\n\nI didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.\n\nIt's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",

        "text": "I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. \n\nMy son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. \n\nI was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.\n\nAfter talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.\n\nHowever, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he \"really liked it\" and \"it would only be fair\", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was \"fair\" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.\n\nThis obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say \"but I need a chair!\" or \"What am I supposed to do now\" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.\n\nHe's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",

The profile picture was very clearly a scantily clad image of her, and the username was my nickname that literally everyone in my life uses. I asked our friend about it and he told me that he had discovered the profile through twitter and then subscribed to the profile, which included dozens of videos of her doing\u2026 spicy things to say the least, solo and with partners, all of which with her face showing.\n\nI was floored and, in a fit of rage, showed the profile to our parents. I mean\u2026 literally anyone who saw that profile that knows us would immediately assume that it\u2019s me considering she\u2019s basically going by my name. Our parents forced her to delete the profile and she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, claiming that I not only ruined her main source of income, but also betrayed her trust.

        "text": "I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. \n\nI never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said \"Einstein\" once and John interrupted him to say, \"I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?\". I once put up a snapchat story saying, \"I love college football!\", and he replied to my story with \"It's called gridiron you moron\".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. \n\nOn one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went \"I'm a Biomed Engineer\". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.\n\nEvery time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, \"What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing\". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. \n\nOver the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, \"damn M0shka you famous now\" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like \"His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent.\" \n\n\nAt this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). \n\nLast week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo\". To which he got angry again and said, \"I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you\". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. \n\nThat's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, \"Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*\" \n\nHis dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",

I decided that I didn't want this hanging over my head in our marriage. So it was tough, but shortly afterwards one night I had a few glasses of wine and told him I had something I needed to talk about. I had considered seducing him, having sex and then telling him so I could at least do it one last time but decided that would be manipulative and dishonest. \n\nSo I sat down and told him: When I said I had \"a lot\" of sexual partners it was over a stint of about 4 months as an escort.\n\nHe was taken back a bit and said \"That's not something I'd expect.\" I figured no one would, I dress modestly, I'm pretty conservative with drinking and I volunteer with the kids programs at my church.\n\nI had tears in my eyes and asked him if his opinion of me had changed. He said \"Well what you did didn't stop you from being the woman I fell in love with so why should it?\" I started crying more...tears of joy. \n\nI begged him to let me know if he had any apprehensions or questions or if it'd come between us in any way. He said he might have questions about any cool or sexy stories sometime but for now no. He even made a quip about \"No wonder you blow my mind in having sex, you were a professional!\" Not really the type of joke I'd normally appreciate but in that time it was perfect. And we ended up going to the bedroom not too much later.\n\nSo now I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I know just how much my fiancee loves me and what he's willing to tolerate in me. It's wonderful! We're both in lockdown basically now, both working from home and I'm so thankful to be able to be with a wonderful and amazing man who I love so much and who loves me so much.\n\nThanks to everyone!",

        "text": "I\u2019m an author of mild success. I\u2019m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.\n\nI responded that my time at the school wasn\u2019t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked \u201cI\u2019m sensing that you\u2019re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?\u201d\n\nI said let\u2019s focus on the story, and she was like \u201cActually this could be a better story.\u201d\n\nSo I said y\u2019know what, sure. Whatever. I don\u2019t owe the school anything, I\u2019m not being paid, and even though it\u2019s been a long time and I\u2019ve grown from what happened, it\u2019s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I\u2019d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.\n\nI mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn\u2019t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me \u201cMoolly\u201d for the rest of the year and when I yelled \u201cMY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY\u201d* she had me suspended for a week.\n\nShe ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went \u201cviral\u201d but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.\n\nA few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the \u201cMoolly\u201d incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?\n\nFinally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I\u2019m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can\u2019t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven\u2019t changed.\n\nIt was a long time ago, yes. I don\u2019t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn\u2019t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?\n\n**Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. ",

I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to. \n\nFor the first seven years of my boys\u2019 lives, I didn\u2019t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons) \n\nWhen I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn\u2019t want it at first but I\u2019m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they\u2019d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We\u2019ve been doing this since they were seven.\n\nI met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything. \n\nMy kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I\u2019m watching TV.\n\nMy son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don\u2019t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don\u2019t feel any different, and it doesn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable. \n\nMy son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time \u201cofficially out\u201d) I was watching \u201cRed\u201d with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, \u201cGood to have you back buddy\u201d. \n\nWe went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn\u2019t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn\u2019t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said \"that's  ok because you are not\" \n\nMy brother says I should understand because this is a big \u201cchange\u201d for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get \u201cused to\u201d this isn\u2019t neither her nor my problem who my son loves. \n\nAm I in the wrong?",

        "text": "Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account.\n\nSo I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.\n\nI have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.\n\nAt first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still\u00a0 a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect.\u00a0\n\nThe next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment.\u00a0\n\nWell, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.\u00a0 So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.\n\nAnyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away.\u00a0\n\nShe obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now.",

I can't give you an update now, but soon. Really sorry.\n\n**Little update on the apology**: it's not out. She said she needed more time to prepare her emotional state and she's overworked with their child, but she'll let me know when I can have the apology.\n\n(\u0298\u8a00\u0298\u256c)\n\n\\*\n\nThank you everyone for giving me advices on how to proceed with this mess.\n\nAfter speaking with my pre-law friend, I decided to go the legal route. I reiterated my compromise with SIL and my brother, but he has fully taken her side. My parents warned me that I'd be disowned and I'd be dead to them if I'm willing to stoop so low.\n\nI hired a lawyer and given all the details on my side. My lawyer said she needs my unedited manuscript for the book and my SIL's published book along with the copy SIL sent to have it proofread and edited. Because the published book has different parts changed, my lawyer needs the unedited version which SIL should still have in the transaction she did with her editor and proofreader. We took the risk to ask SIL for the unedited copy she sent to her editor & proofreader despite the chance of having her feign \"I don't remember their names, I don't have their contacts anymore, I don't want to, etc.\" I told SIL that we will go through the route of having to use third-party notarization to ensure no foul play on either part (have 1 individual look at my unedited manuscript and the one she sent to her hired editor + proofreader).\n\nOnce I told her that, she must've realized I was not bluffing. SIL and my brother accepted the compromise (I take the pseudonym, the royalties: with evidence of sold copies). I stipulated that SIL must put a message out to her followers on her blog that she stole from me and not a single word in the book is hers. I thank the Redditors for suggesting that.\n\nShe is clearly pissed off and disgusted with me for doing this to my own family.\n\nI threatened her with further legal proceedings if she doesn't do it. No lawsuit happened, but I'm glad I got a professional option just in case. As words got back to my parents of what I did and how dare I got a lawyer to punish SIL because her blog followers will surely lose trust in her and future revenue.\n\nI told them and my parents that if they have anything to say, use my business email. I'm done with them. They treated an outsider (SIL one month into dating my brother) better than they ever did to me. I don't need that negativity dragging me down.\n\nI'm happier, more free with my opinions, and I don't have to feel the need to compete with everything SIL does just to get my parents to love me a little more than a daughter in name.\n\nI have my friends; they've always been more of a family unit to me than my biological ones. I knew I was going to lose something coming out of this, but I didn't expect I'd be okay with the disappointment and hurt.\n\nThank you, everyone. And no, I will not be telling anyone what the name of the book is because I only came here to get a moral judgment and update everyone on what happened. Please don't think I'm using this for clout. The book will not be promoted on Reddit: not then, not now, and not in the future either.",

        "text": "Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I\u2019m on mobile - I apologise. \n\n\nI (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) \u2018Mary\u2019. They\u2019ve known each other since they were in high school and she\u2019s considered \u2018one of the boys\u2019, if you may. That basically means she\u2019s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don\u2019t mind at all, I trust my husband. \n\n\nWell, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I\u2019m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband\u2019s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me \u2018are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?\u2019 to \u2018are you a gypsy? I bet you\u2019ve got some of that gypsy blood in you\u2019 (which is just blatantly racist)\n\n\nLast week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she\u2019s been understanding so it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll say something this time.\n\n\nIt was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary\u2019s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I\u2019m just a \u2018immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband\u2019s life\u2019 and I\u2019ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn\u2019t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. \n\nAITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I\u2019m way too sensitive about my heritage and I\u2019m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I\u2019m still not ok with her.\n\n\nEDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I\u2019m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We\u2019ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I\u2019ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.\n\n\nEDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: \n\n\n\nA lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband\u2019s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn\u2019t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they\u2019ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I\u2019m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she\u2019s focusing on her career, she\u2019s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. \n\n\n\n\nBut now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I\u2019m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won\u2019t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I\u2019m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Ave\u021bi grij\u0103 de voi!",

        "text": "For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  \n\nUnfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  \n\nFirst day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  \n\nI talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. \n\nHe started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  \n\nSo I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  \n\nI don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.  \n\nHe has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",

        "text": "I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. \n\nMy brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n\nSince then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.\n\nI told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?",

        "text": "Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account. \n\nI (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven\u2019t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn\u2019t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would\u2019ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn\u2019t really expecting that. \n\nI asked him why. He said that he didn\u2019t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn\u2019t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn\u2019t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn\u2019t want anyone to see him with the pads because they\u2019d think he was a \u201ctr***y\u201d. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn\u2019t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe I might\u2019ve pushed it too far.\n\nSo AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?\n\n*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I\u2019m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we\u2019ll see how it goes*\n\n**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn\u2019t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn\u2019t feel like he had to, and that I could\u2019ve \u201cheld it in\u201d and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can\u2019t \u201chold in\u201d menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could\u2019ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. \n\nI asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he\u2019d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn\u2019t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I\u2019d need help is if I was a \u201ccripple\u201d. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn\u2019t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. \n\nI can\u2019t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can\u2019t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month\u2019s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I\u2019m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I\u2019m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all.",

I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with.\n\nWhen i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice. \n\nWell onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.",

We wanted kids but because of my health problems this wasn't possible.\nWe decided to go with surrogacy, my friend nominated her sister ( Brittany 29) I agreed right away cause I know Brittany and the family.\nWe've set everything up. Discussed payment, short and long term plans, counseling and dr appointments. We explored IVF and chose a private clininc to get it done.\n\nIt started after Brittany took a pregnancy test. She only told my husband though she had both our numbers. she only sent my husband a pic of the test while he was at work and sent me nothing when I gave her my personal contact info but it was okay. Things got complicated when Brittany started having access to our credit cards for her own wants and claim they were the baby's needs. She excluded me from dr visits and scans and had only my husband go with her. Her excuse was my husband drives and has time since I work and \"unavailable\" most of the time. I felt isolated from this experience but said nothing knowing she's bearing a lot of burden so I had patience. My husband had no idea what was going on and if this was normal. This was new to us so we didn't know.\n\n\nShe's 7 months in and last week she had us visit to discuss things that I thought we'd previously agreed on but she said she changed her mind about and her mom was there too. I heard Brittany out and was shocked when she gave a list of how things should be from now on since she said \"there was lot of confusion\" in the past cause of me stressing her out by complaining.\nShe requested she gets say in things like baby name after I \"deleted\" the list of names she sent to my husband.\nShe wanted more access to my husband's credit cards/free time to get stuff done at her place. Also more time with the baby than agreed on.\nThen wrapped up by saying only my husband should be with her in the delivery room and used the hospital as excuse. I got up and firmly stated I don't agree on her new terms and that she had to stop acting like she was my husband's wife and this was their baby. My husband didn't speak til she started crying. He asked me to sit down but I said I had boundaries, reminded her what her role was and how she overstepped.\n\nHer mom went off and and said her daughter was being mistreated when she put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for us, to make us a family. She gave up a part of her life in those months to give us what we want and I was acting selfish and ungrateful. She had us leave then told my friend and it got more complicated. I was told to apologize for what i said. IATA\n\n\nEdit: yes, we agreed on paying for the surrogacy like I stated above. So no favors or anything.\n\nEdit: No, we did not have a legal contract because my friend said there was no need for us to do that and basically talked us out of it since we are considered family but we had an agreement including paying her.\n\nEdit: Question about whether Brittany had kids of her own. She was a single mom of a 4 year old who passed away from an accident. She had him at young age but she always seemed in good mental and physical health.",

However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in.

I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she\u2019s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?",

We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn\u2019t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn\u2019t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. \n\nOur wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. \n\nMy wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She\u2019s in her mid 30\u2019s, we have 3 kids and she doesn\u2019t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she\u2019s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. \n\nAnyway, she\u2019s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. She looks great all the time. She\u2019s gorgeous without makeup. She\u2019s really talented with it though and she\u2019s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she\u2019s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she\u2019s at a nightclub. I think it\u2019s cute and funny. \n\nMy brother thinks she\u2019s doing it because she\u2019s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he\u2019s concerned because he\u2019s seen her on FaceTime and he\u2019s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn\u2019t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing. \n\nHe\u2019s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he\u2019s probably well intentioned. \n\nI want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven\u2019t asked my wife why she\u2019s recently starting wearing more makeup and I\u2019m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. \n\nShe\u2019s spending her money on stuff for her face and it\u2019s a creative hobby. I\u2019m not going to be the dick that ruins someone\u2019s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there\u2019s a sinister motive behind it. It makes her happy so I assume that\u2019s why she\u2019s doing it. Asking why is dumb and insulting in my opinion.",

        "text": "So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.\n\nSo I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he \"mellowed out\" \n\nIt makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now. \n\nIt's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help. \n\nSo I took a different approach. I stopped calling him \"angry\", or calling what he was doing \"arguing\" or \"yelling\". I just swapped in the words \"emotional\" or \"throwing a tantrum\" or \"having a fit\"\n\nI was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes) \n\nSo I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people \"Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake\" \n\nOr when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him \"Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets.\" \n\nOr when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say \"Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally.\" \n\nI tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like \"Oh, another of Jay's fits\" or something.\n\nI got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face \"Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional\"\n\nAnd again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.\n\nAfter a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much. \n\nAnyway, he slipped once this week and I just said \"I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional\" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said \"dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me\" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) \n\nI feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the \"proper channels\" didn't\n\nAITA for calling my coworker emotional when he got mad?",

I was very young when 9/11 happened, as were the rest of the people in my year.\n\nThere's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk.\n\nBut today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. \n\nShe said that \"you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect.\" \n\nI obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.)\n\nShe made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said \"Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right\". I don't know why that set me off, but it did. \n\nI told her \"No, I'm just busy texting my DAD\". She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA??\n\nYes, I am aware I have spelling mistakes. I speak Arabic at home.\n\nEDIT: For everyone wondering, the professor was out of the room. He'd already given us our lecture.",

I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a \"realization\" moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids.

Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.\n\nI felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.\n\nAnyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.\n\nI guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad \"nagging her\". When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?",

The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. \n\nWe made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.\n\nWife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the \"how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?\" card and I said \"Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?\" and she just up and screamed. \n\nThis has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. \n\nThe car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. \n\nSo AITA?",

Both Jess and I work on the west coast so it takes some time to get there with all of our kids and family. \n\nI saw several notifications from my parents Ring Doorbell and I\u2019m a lawyer. I reminded my family we will prosecute. Jess and I are on the same page. \nJess gets to my parents house first and notices stuff is missing and my parents had security cameras and an Alexa show. It shown my cousin taking stuff from the house. So Jess did what we agreed on and called the police and two of our cousins was arrested. Because it was over a thousand dollars both are looking at felonies. My cousin said my dad promised him this stuff and I have my dad\u2019s will making me executor of the estate. I told him he should have waited to file a claim with estate and everyone was warned about what would happen. \nJess and I don\u2019t have the best relationship with our extended family and We are not dropping charges. Because of this drama dad was quietly cremated with no service and we plan to hold one when scattered our parents ashes at Jess\u2019s house in a tree planted for them. \nMy last living grandma is upset about it but she sided with my cousins and aunt saying we are too tough on having them arrested.",

But turns out they also invited her husband\u2019s side of the family. \n\nWhen it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I\u2019m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they\u2019re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You\u2019d have to look really close to even notice. \n\nI\u2019ve been to their pool many times and she\u2019s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. \n\nWhen I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I\u2019m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn\u2019t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. \n\nShe told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. \n\nWhen she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn\u2019t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn\u2019t expect her to ask me this. \n\nMy mood was soured after that and I didn\u2019t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. \n\nI told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. \n\nMy parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she\u2019s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn\u2019t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.\n\nWhat she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn\u2019t mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?",

        "text": "\n\nI F,33 found out that my ex husband M, 37 was cheating on me when I was 7 months pregnant with our son. I got a divorce and we share custody of our 3 yro old son. My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her \"house\" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.\n\n\nI made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.\n\n\nI sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as \"punishment\" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.\n\nMy ex husband called me yelling about my \"pathetic attempt\" to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her \"future inlaws\". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",

She and my dad actually met in a harry potter \u201cIRC\u201d (like Disord but for old people) in the early 00s got married had kids and from day one decided to embarrass us for life by naming us after some Harry Potter and Star Wars characters.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly been hell. I have a stupid name and since we were little my parents have forced stuff like Harry Potter, Star Wars, marvel movies, etc etc down our throats. Everything is about dragons and magic and blah blah blah. I\u2019m so sick of it. Every birthday every holiday everything is just organized around \u201cfandom.\u201d\n\nSo just like every Christmas the days leading up to Christmas we have to sit down every night and watch Harry Potter movies. It\u2019s. So. Fucking. BORING!!!! I can usually get away with knitting or drawing on my Ipad during this but this year my mom was like \u201clet\u2019s just have a technology and distraction free night every night\u201d\n\nI arranged to go over to my friend Missy\u2019s house instead for like two nights. Missy\u2019s family is NORMAL and likes things a NORMAL amount. My mom got really mad and started talking about how it\u2019s a family tradition and how I\u2019m basically rejecting her and went on her whole thing about how \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t exist if it wasn\u2019t for harry potter.\u201d\n\nI finally had it and just yelled \u201cNOBODY CARES THAT YOU WERE A BIG NAME IN THE HARRY POTTER FAN CLUB!!! I don\u2019t like Harry Potter! I don\u2019t like Star Wars! I HATE MARVEL MOVIES THEY\u2019RE ALL SO BORING PLEASE JUST LET ME HAVE MY OWN INTERESTS!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it I started crying because I was just so frustrated because everything always has to be about harry potter this star wars that and now that we\u2019re all older they started doing game of thrones. EVERYTHING is centered around some kind of movie or tv show or book series. \n\nJust onces I want my family to band around something that DOESN\u2019T have to do with media or these nerdy things. We live in Utah where we have like 5 National Parks and even though I ask every year for my birthday I\u2019VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO ARCHES!!!! \n\nWell my sister called me saying that mom was angry and to just come home and to stop with the theatrics. I told her that I\u2019m sick of having all this old \u201cnerd\u201d stuff crammed down my throat and just once I want to have a normal time watching normal Christmas movies and not having to pause for \u201clightsabre battles\u201d.\u201d\n\nAITA?!??!\n\n**HEY GUYS** I know you think you're \"cool\" and \"in on the joke\" wink wink when you DM me and ask me for my name, but I'm a teenage girl and that's not really how it's coming across. Please stop DMing me I don't care.\n\n**for those of you telling me in dms \"IRC didn't do fandom\" it was part of a \"livejournal\" community. Someone in the community had a fan site they all liked. It had a chatroom. I'm sure there was other stuff too?",

He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.\n\nMy daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.\n\nSome of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.\n\nIt was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.\n\nSo while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a \"morbid\" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?",

        "text": "About two months ago, my husband and I got \u201cmarried\u201d in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it\u2019s their only daughter\u2019s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest \u2014 his family did not contribute (which is fine!). \n\nThe wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn\u2019t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he \u201cproposed\u201d (something I didn\u2019t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. \n\nVery few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren\u2019t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn\u2019t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I\u2019ll call her Carol) and I aren\u2019t close. She\u2019s fine enough in low doses, but...\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must\u2019ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. \n\nCarol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a \u201cgift grab\u201d (our wedding website stated that someone\u2019s presence was gift enough\u2014 we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband\u2019s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back\u2014something we are fine with giving her. \n\nFor me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I\u2019ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.",

        "text": "Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main.\n\nMy sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.\n\nProblem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to \"lend\" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me \"your sister needs $X.XX for the kids\" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)\n\nSo over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. \n\nLater she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies \"God will provide like he has so far,\" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. \n\nIt's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",

        "text": "\n\nMy biological (12yo) daughter ~ Susan likes to collect and read old children's books. She's become incredible reader. She had problems with reading and learning before and we were advised to encourage her to read and eversince she started reading (which she does regularly) her skills improved. she also reads to her 2yo sister everynight.\n\nI have a (16yo), stepson ~ Levi who can be a hothead sometimes. We don't have a son~dad relationship but I respect him and he respects me though he can act quite mean and selfish towards me and his sisters. He'd throw away stuff that belongs to us over small arguments and teases Susan for spending a lot of time to read calling her grandma.\n\nMy wife and I discussed his behavior and had conversations and agreed on punishments but Levi'd go to his dad's place whenever he causes troubles then have his dad yell at me for wanting to discuss a suitable punishment. Then Levi comes home days later expecting me to let go of what he did everytime, it's frustrating.\n\nI got a call at work from Susan saying Levi took her entire book collection and threw them in the pool after she refused to lend him and his friends her camera for his trip. My wife helped get them out but they were wet and some were torn. It was horrific because some of those books are hard to get and meant a lot to Susan as a part of her life.\nI was so mad at Levi I came home to have a conversation with my wife to decide on a punishment but he already packed a small bag and went to his dad's, I asked my wife how could she let him basically run after doing this and she said he called his dad and he came to pick him up after Susan said that I was coming home to deal with the problem.\n\nI went to his dad's house and he refused to let me see him. I told him how Levi was hiding from consequences and his dad tried to justify why Levi was acting out by blaming me for how me and Susan treat him. He even said he'd get CPS involved if I ever try to punish him because I'm not his dad, I have no right. Adding what Levi did was a reaction to my daughter being mean to him. He told me to leave because Levi won't come home til I promise not to do anything about what he did and put it in writing.\n\nI told him Levi should stay there with him then. He's not to come back til ~he~ get proper punishment.\nHis dad argued it's his mom's house too and called my wife and she asked to let this go and we'll figure out some way to resolve it but I don't think it's fair for Susan to have her books ruined and Levi getting away with it. They're asking me to let it go but this will only encourage Levi to do worse if I don't deal with it now.\nIt's been 2 weeks and my in-laws say I was out of line for banning Levi from coming home and are telling me to step back but I refused.\n\nEDIT ~ Levi's dad thinks that because I'm not his bio dad then I have no right to punish him for whatever he does in the house. In the past his dad caused issues when I used to take Levi's electronics (that his dad bought) as punishment. Then I got talked out of punishing him everytime he did something unacceptable wether to me or his sisters.\n\nI've arranged for family therapy but Levi's dad refused to let him go.\n\nEDIT ~ I'd like to mention that my inlaws said that Levi is willing to apologize to Susan and so this should be enough to get this over with but I kept saying no and for that I'm being considered at fault.",

During the phone call I asked them why there was monthly payments being sent to my parents. Turns out my parents were living beyond their means for a while because my mother quit her job to be a full time stay at home mom. My grandparents decided to help out by sending them money monthly to help with my parents mortgage and also to set aside some of that money for college savings for both my brother and I that was to be split evenly. Turns out my parents only planned to put that savings towards my brother's college. And that's also how they bought his car as well. So from now on my parents are now on their own financially. Likely my mother will have to go back to work to help my dad keep up the mortgage.\n\nI confronted my parents and asked why they've always treated my brother as the favorite. Then asked if there was something I needed to know. Turns out there was...**NOTHING**! Literally nothing! I'm not an affair baby. Not even an unplanned pregnancy! They just liked my brother more! I was mad as hell and we argued a lot before I left the room because I'd had enough.\n\nMy grandparents showed up on Saturday with a moving truck. My parents were floored when we started bringing in boxes to pack. My father got in our way and I reminded him how he said that I should move out, so I am. My mother cried some more and said that my father was just angry in the moment when he said that, and they had been counting on my rent money to help with my brother's college fund. I asked if that meant he would never have had to pay rent like I did when he turns 18. My father then said that since I was taking a gap year to work, then my rent money could have helped my brother. Which means they never intended for him to get a job while going to college.\n\nMy grandpa was enraged and confronted my father, saying he raised him better than this. He chewed him out saying he's never been more disappointed in him, and they will no longer receive any more financial support. Then said he'd disown them both if they ever tried to retaliate against me for exposing them. My father backed down and neither he or my mother said another word to me. I had a bit of an awkward conversation with my brother as we said our goodbyes to each other. And that was it. I just got in my car, waved and drove off.\n\nI'm now fully moved into my new room at my grandparents' house. It's a little smaller, but nice. And my grandparents are very welcoming. I'm going to keep working hard to move forward from here and I appreciate everyone's support.",

He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.\n\nOur dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.\n\nWhen we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.\n\nA few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.\n\nI told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.\n\nWhen he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.\n\nI was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",

I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. \n\n-I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro\n\n-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. \n\n-Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. \n\nAITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",

He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren\u2019t there\u2026 I was fucking slack jawed. \n\nI told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM \u201cyou just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.\u201d\n\nI was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read \u201cwelcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)\u201d and this is where things go down hill. \n\nI did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn\u2019t want to change her last name, and she\u2019s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She\u2019s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she\u2019s doubled down.\n\nWhen she saw the sign she joked \u201cMrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!\u201d Everyone went silent until his mom said \u201cWell the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!\u201d She takes the ring off and see\u2019s \u201cMrs.(his last name)\u201d engraved on the band.\n\nThen she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn\u2019t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said \u201cThis was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.\u201d\n\nSHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That\u2019s when I\u2019m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).\n\nShe was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said \u201cdoes he really think I\u2019m that shallow?\u201d She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. \n\nShe\u2019s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you\u2019ve all helped me realize, this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.\n\nEdit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn\u2019t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.\n\nEDIT 2 (update): I did not mention this plan when I originally posted just in case her ex found this thread, but I can report now that we got a heads up last night that he wasn\u2019t at their apartment, so we ran over and got most of her shit out, at least all the really important stuff. To those asking, no she isn\u2019t going back to him, it\u2019s over.",

        "text": "I am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked.\n\nHer parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket.\n\nBut when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. \n\nOn the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?\n\nThe first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip \n\nAnd by \"they wanted to cook\" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo \"traditional\" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.\n\nSo it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9\n\nI screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.\n\nBut he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? \n\nMeg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.\n\nThe argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself \"the help\"\n\nHis dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.\n\nI left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  \n\nThen I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. \n\nI went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things. \n\nAITA for staying on that vacation and using the flight home? ,,,,",

        "text": "When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.\n\nMy parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.\n\nMy mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.\n\nThis year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying \"She is your sister\" and \"If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?\"\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "I have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

Ngl most of my mom\u2019s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom\u2019s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.\n\nMy names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it\u2019s a shame I got stuck with it. I\u2019m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.\n\nBut literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it\u2019s \u201ctoo many syllables\u201d (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me \u201cElliot\u201d as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it\u2019s not my name. \n\nIs always the same thing when I see them. She\u2019ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it\u2019s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don\u2019t like it but she always say I\u2019m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.\n\nSo I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it\u2019s bothering me more that she don\u2019t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. \n\nHer name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  \n\nTbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn\u2019t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d. I told her nah I\u2019mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.\n\nIt got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn\u2019t talk to me until we got home. \n\nShe say what I did was outta line and I don\u2019t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I\u2019m grounded until I do. Haven\u2019t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to \u201cinsult my grandmother\u201d ?",

        "text": "Hear me out. I (31F) and my husband tried for 5 years to get pregnant. Testing eventually revealed I have eggs of fucking steel and without medical help I'll never get pregnant. So that's what we did. Gave our samples, one petri dish and 9 months later I have 2 beautiful fraternal twin boys. Jack and Adam (fake).\n\nThing is Jake has a condition. Without going into detail, requires a shot once a week. Once he is older he can take pills. I went back to work and MIL offered to watch the babes (shes wonderful, I trust her 100%. They were 9months.. Now 16months) during this time she would give his injection as we had a schedule. 10am before snack and nap. Worked very well until a month ago when she gave the shot to the wrong kid. Now they may be fraternal but they look identical. I'll be honest my husband and I even mix them up sometimes. Everyone does. She immediately noticed her mistake called 911 and they were transferred to hospital. By the time I got there Adam had been given the reversal agent and they were both happily sipping on juice loving the attention. We went home the same night told to push fluids. He was never in danger. Its a very slow acting medication that, at worst, would have given him diarrhea in a few days. MIL was beside herself. I tried to ease her worry but she refused to babysit so to daycare they went. \n\nThis daycare has a nurse cause some of the kids have medications so she new what to do but the worry of mixing up the kids was a valid concern (and they would NOT keep name tags on) Doctor recommended a medical tattoo. Explained they tattoo a freckle, no bigger then the end of a pencil eraser, on an area of skin that's easily seen while the child is under mild sedation similar to dental offices. Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. \n\nHe has a 2mm brown freckle on his earlobe.  From entering the office to leaving it took 30 minutes. Never felt a thing.\n\nMIL lost her shit the second I mentioned a medical tattoo. I tried to explain but she just freaked out so I put both kids on the floor and told her to pick up Jack and find the tattoo. She picked up Adam So I handed her Jack and after 20 minutes still couldn't find it. Stripped him to his skivvies. I finally pointed it out and she went \"That's just a freckle\"  I just said... \"My point exactly. Adam doesn't have a freckle there.. So that's how daycare can tell them apart\"\n\nShe's still pissed and ranting. Once I explain to others and they fail to find it they understand but they still think I went to far in tattooing my child and altering their body. I believe I took the necessary precautions recommended by the doctor and the tattoo will fade with sun exposure and as he grows. By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So.. AITA?",

        "text": "I (30 F) my ex-husband (31m). Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. \nHe wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.\n\nMy ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).\nSince my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. \n\nMy girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn\u2019t want to take her favorite shirt over there.\n\nI immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be doing this good.\n\nI was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.\nTo a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.\nWe had a \u201cgirls\u201d tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. \n\nThe following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn\u2019t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.\n\nThey were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can\u2019t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn\u2019t want them to wear it. \nHe called me an A for being petty.\nAITA?\nEdited to add. \nThank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.\n1) AP stands for Affair partner \n2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.\n3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don\u2019t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories. Thank you for the love and support",

My daughter \"Judy\" F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time.\n\nJudy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.\n\n\nWe got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to \"photoshop\" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said \"yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now\".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.\n\nObviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even \"saying goodbye\", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.",

I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming.\n\n\nMIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed.\n\nlast night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer.\n\nI got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her.\n\n\nHe came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying \"shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?\" then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.\nAITA for not asking her nicely like my husband wanted?\n\nEdit; some mistakes because my hands are a bit unsteady.",

I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. \n\nI've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. \n\nOn boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. \n\nThe next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. \n\nI told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. \n\nSo I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. \n\nI think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. \n\nAITA?\n\nI think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",

I just bought a house and my wife is expecting out son in November, so I let him know I was limited in what I could contribute financially, but did tell him I would try my best.  So, I wend to the bachelor party in Maine, I rented the tux, and paid for mine and my wife's dinner at the rehearsal dinner.  I also had a gift of $300 that I was going to give them, but we will get to why I didn't give it to them.\n\nHis (now wife, then fiance) texted me multiple times a day with updates--fine.  I didn't always respond and it got to the point where if I didn't repsond at LEAST once a day, I'd get a call from my buddy.  (I have a full time job and am redoing some rooms in my house, so I'm busy.)  She texted me for the following reasons:\n\n1.  My wife was NOT allowed to talk about our pregnancy, at all.  She didn't want anyone to focus on that more than her, the bride.\n2. She was NOT going to order special food for my wife (no one asked her to, my wife was fine with whatever she was going to be served.)\n3. I was not helping the groom enough, he had to help her with favors, seating charts and programs, so I had to help him with those things, according to her.  She also said to get ready to help with thank you notes after the wedding.\n4. She said if I was a true best man, I would offer to pay for the bar bill.  I don't even know what that means.\n5. She had to read a approve my speech before the rehearsal dinner and wanted to be include as much, as my buddy.  She told me to make up things if I had to.  I was also NOT allowed to include anyone but the two of them and no inside jokes or stories about my buddy that didn't include her.\n6. Her last text said to tell my wife to keep it together and not make a pregnancy scene during the wedding. Also, she wanted her to choose a dress that downplayed her pregnancy as much as possible.\n\nI was just so aggravated, I spoke to my friend to see if he could reason with her.  He told me to just play ball on this one, it's her day and to cut him a break, because he'd be dealing with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I was annoyed but calmed down.\n\nThe day of, all the bride and my buddy do is scold me, berate me and bark orders.  I head down to the bar for the a drink...the bride's mother is there and warns me not to get drunk because I've ruined her daughter's day enough.  Final straw.\n\nI didn't give them the card with the cash and in the speech, I used my friend's exact wording about having to deal with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I wished them the best and told him I'd always be there for him, especially during the divorce.  AITA?",

        "text": "My 7 year old daughter\u2019s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter\u2019s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. \n\nA couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter\u2019s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. \n\nSo after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher\u2019s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. \n\nI sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn\u2019t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. \n\nI encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn\u2019t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.\n\nShe got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was \u201cKeeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly\u201d and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.\n\nSo class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there\u2019s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said \u201cHi, this is *Keeley\u2019s* Dad. Her\u2019s name not Kelly. It\u2019s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.\u201d \n\nA few hours later I had an email in my inbox \u201cinviting\u201d my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. \n\nThe long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should\u2019ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were \u201csimilar enough\u201d for it to \u201cnot have warranted such drastic action.\u201d\n\nThat surprised me. I couldn\u2019t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being that annoying \u201cmy kid matters most\u201d parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that\u2019s a basic part of her job.

        "text": "My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.\n\nAll of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .\n\nIn the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.\n\nFast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.\n\nSo my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.\n\nMy mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.\n\nMy friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?\n\nEdit: Answers to some questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ic651e/wibta_if_i_send_my_parents_to_jail/g231dny/)",

        "text": "My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.\n\nWell this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.\n\nI (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.\n\nWell it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for \"being cruel to my brother\" and \"abandoning family when they need help\". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I \"understood the right thing to do\" before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other.\n\nSo I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA?\n\n\\-\n\nSorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer.\n\nLots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful.\n\n1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.\n2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.\n3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.\n4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.\n5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious).\n\n\\- Edit 2 -\n\nTo everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst. \n\nAccording to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him.\n\nAlso its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...",

        "text": "For context, this year was the first time we would try the \"elf on the shelf\" with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas.\n\nEvery Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a \"kid of Christmas\". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left \"Santa Claus\" footsteps, ate a carrot and \"grass\" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that.\n\nMy husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it.\n\nWe bought the cute Elf. My kids named it \"Bob\". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it \"fly\" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him.\n\nBut my husband took seriously the \"Behave or Bob would be naughty\" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed.\n\nFast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me \"no idea\". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. \"Bob\" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents.\n\nMy blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the \"magic\" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.\n\nEdit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common.\n\n1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent.\n\n2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from \"Bob\". Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him.\n\n3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too.\n\n4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be \"attacked\" by Bob.",

I do however pay my parents about \u00a3300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I\u2019m in my final year of uni so I\u2019ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. \n\nI also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it\u2019s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to \u00a3100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to \u00a380 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I\u2019ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.\n\nThe only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was \u201cfree money.\u201d I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can\u2019t Magic up that kind of money. \n\nThings went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.\n\nWhen I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they\u2019re all trying to take me for a ride and they\u2019re trying to manipulate me cos I\u2019m young and they think I\u2019m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn\u2019t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It\u2019s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument.

        "text": "Link to original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ljaump/aita_for_not_attending_my_friends_wedding_on_the/)\n\nHello Reddit, I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who replied, I was not expecting my post to get this level of attention. I have read all of your comments, and thank you once again. I am in tears and became an emotional mess after reading your thoughtful responses, thank you for the love and support. I have always felt as some sort of emotional burden to my friends, so thank you for your encouraging messages and telling me to keep my head up high. Even though we are all strangers on the internet, it sort of felt like I had gained new family. My heart goes out to the people who have messaged me privately of their experiences with losing their loved ones to drunk driving as well. Please know, I have felt your pain, you are not alone in this and I wish you all the love in this world.\n\nNow for the update, I did what some of you suggested and called my other friends to let them know what Amy had asked of me. They were quite livid and angry for me as they had no idea what Amy was planning for the wedding, we arranged a zoom call with her the next day to discuss why is she being so insensitive to me. Well, the call was quite the battle. It started off calm, then Amy just blew up. You guys were right when you said that Amy was jealous of the attention that I had received during the time of my family\u2019s death anniversary, her wedding was a way to shift the attention towards her. She tried to explain to us by having the wedding on that day, it will turn a negative situation into a positive one. When she realized she wasn\u2019t convincing enough, it felt as though a mask had fallen from her face and she started yelling and insulting me. She said that she is tired of having to play the supportive friend role and that it\u2019s been 7 years, I should just get over it by now or go join my family in the ground. My friends lost their anger and called her every name in the book. I am honestly just shocked and disappointed at the person who used to be my friend. It breaks my heart knowing I lost another person in my life, but I guess you guys are right in the sense that she never really was a friend. I now look back at our friendship and realized it was often one sided on my part. I wish it didn\u2019t take me so long to realize it. No one in our friend group of 6 people are going to her wedding now. We have decided to go no contact with Amy and block her on all social media. My friends have offered to go visit my family\u2019s graves together with me, I accepted and we are now planning to also make a scrapbook with my family's pictures. For once I am actually looking forward to this day, and will start to plan more eventful activities like this.\n\nThank you once again to everyone for helping me through this. And please remember, do not drink and drive, I am begging you, please don't. Please drink responsibly and drive safely everyone.\n\nEdit: I was once again not expecting this amount of attention. I am in literal tears, thank you everyone for your kind words and sympathy. I appreciate your love and support. I don't think I deserve the awards you all have given me, thank you kind strangers. Some are asking about Amy's fianc\u00e9 and his thoughts, we haven't heard anything as we still haven't even met him. We tried several times to meet him last year, but something always came up. I guess we'll never know his true feelings.\n\nEdit: I am so sorry for not being able to reply to everyone, thank you for your kind words and support",

        "text": "I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'\n\nSo the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"How do you pronounce that?\" It's Tina!\n\nI have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, \"Just for the record, my name is Tina!\" to lighthearted, \"Tina, like Tina Belcher!\" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, \"Thanks Tiana!\" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:\n\nChuck: Thanks, Tiana\n\nTina: No problem, Chad!\n\nJessica: Hi Tiara!\n\nTina: Good morning, Jennifer!\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.\n\nEDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:\n\nA lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!\n\nA lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.\n\nA lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!\n\nAnd finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.\n\nEDIT #2:\n\nNo, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or \"Tiara\"\n\nNo, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.\n\nNo, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!\n\nYes, I correct them every time.\n\nNo, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!\n\nResponding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",

        "text": "\n\nI'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend \"Carl\" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. My husband sometimes calls Carl his \"nicotine\" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. \n\nWe planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.\n\nMy husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull \"Carl is a widower\" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.\n\nThey got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.",

        "text": "Heyo,\nI'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.\n\nSome friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.\n\nI was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. \n\nI have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.\n\nAITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?\n\nEdit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.\n\nEdit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.\n\nResources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia \n\nFor groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. \n\nYou get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say \"Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard\". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. \n\nMedication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!",

My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. \nA few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. \nYesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. \nBefore we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said \"besides, he's right, kids need a mom\". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said \"see, it's even turning you into a pu**y\". \nMy in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said \"listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person\". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. \nShe is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. \nAita for throwing her out?\n\nUPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. \nI want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. \nMy nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons. One day at a time.",

She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as \u201ca vapid slut\u201d and her husband \u201ca pathetic cuck\u201d along with other slurs I don\u2019t want to repeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that\u2019s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister\u2019s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I\u2019m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We\u2019re definitely concerned for our daughter about what\u2019s happening at school and we\u2019re looking into therapy.\n\nFor clarification, as for my SIL\u2019s privacy, she didn\u2019t consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",

        "text": "\nMy husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail.\n\nSo what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it \"Pregnancy Jar\". I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months.\n\n\nLast week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish.\n\n\nSo AITA for this?\n\n\n\n[Edit - Q&As... ]\n\n(1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse. \n\n(2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too.\n\n(3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer.\n\n(4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs.\n\n\nOne more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol.\n\nAlso, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.",

Appreciate the reassurance and understanding my decision when seems that many in this situation didn\u2019t. I remained firm in my decision about not letting them use my property for their wedding. Even if they changed their mind about inviting us which honestly I don\u2019t care about anymore. \nRick\u2019s family (thanks to him) got a hold of my cell so that was more people I had to deal with. I put my foot down with Rick a few days ago and told him directly that I will go to the police and press charges for harassment (I have all the texts and calls documented). Also had a very long talk with Carla about everything going on. She apologized for it all. And she knows it\u2019s her own fault. \n\nWell she decided to be the one to call things off in the end. Some of my friends still seem to think it\u2019s my fault and I\u2019m taking some distance from them for a while. And also from Carla after getting some confirmation on a few things that I needed to know. Whole thing is a mess. I\u2019m only glad in the end that I didn\u2019t give in to their demands and the constant bugging has stopped.. It still was a huge headache over the last few days and not the kind of drama I want back in my life. Thank you to everyone who made me feel supported in this. It helped a lot not feeling like the only other person (aside from my wife), who thought their demand was insane and inappropriate.",

        "text": "I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even. \n\n\nShe also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other.\n\n\nHonestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??\n\n\nI have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.\n\n\nOne afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. \n\n\nI received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.\n\n\nI went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. \n\n\nShe was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.\n\n\nOur parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long.",

        "text": "So a couple of months ago things went down with a new colleague who was lying about her language skills. Original here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/logumz/aita\\_for\\_accidentally\\_calling\\_out\\_a\\_new\\_colleague/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/logumz/aita_for_accidentally_calling_out_a_new_colleague/)\n\nMany people gave the advice to go to HR, others said NOT to go to HR because that would be escalating the situation. I decided not to go to HR right then, but I did take the advice to write down what happened, with the time and the names of the other colleagues present just in case. I thought the situation might blow over, because Cathy was probably just embarrassed.\n\nWell, I was wrong. Cathy kept being cold to me, rolling her eyes at me in meetings and talking behind my back. Another colleague came to confront me at one point to ask me why I'd been so mean. Apparently Cathy was telling a different version of what happened. Cathy said that I'd said mean things to her in Dutch and was making fun of her in Dutch, so no one else but her could understand. She was smart enough to only tell these stories to colleagues who weren't actually there for it. Word got around and it turned into a bigger issue, with a couple people actually questioning my character, mostly just colleagues that don't work very close to me.\n\nHR got wind of it after a while and I got called in close to a month after the incident. They had already met with Cathy and she'd told them the \"she cursed me out in Dutch and was very mean to me\" story. I told them the full story and everything that happened after. They asked me if there was anyone else present who could confirm this, so those colleagues came and told them that Cathy had lied about speaking a language, stormed out and then started calling me a b-word etc. to others. They thanked me for my time and I got on with work.\n\nNothing happened until a week later when I was informed that Cathy was asked to leave. Apparently Cathy had doubled down on the lies and told everyone I was the one lying and she did speak those languages, so my boss told her in that case she'd have no problem talking to one of our Canadian colleagues (who wasn't involved in the situation) in French in front of him, just to confirm. At this point Cathy admitted she had been lying. It turned out she didn't speak a word of French either, or Norwegian, which was the third language she was lying about. This was enough for them to let her go, because part of the reason they hired her was that they were so impressed by her speaking multiple languages and work experiences she'd had abroad. The work experiences were made up as well.\n\nI'm just happy it's over. I'm confident it wasn't really my fault it blew up now, if it wasn't me who caught her in a lie, someone else probably would have down the line. The few people who kind of believed her ended up coming to me and apologizing for questioning me about what happened, so that's all sorted\n\nEdit: some people asking why they didn't test her language skills in the hiring process: our jobs don't actually require us to speak Dutch, French or Norwegian. I think they probably just saw it as a \"plus\" or something that made her stand out from other candidates. ",

I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.\n\nI felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nUpdate: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can \"end the conflict\" but he wants me to :\n\n* hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.\n* Swear that I don't have any copies to \"use\" against his mom later.\n* Apologize to his mom.\n* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.\n\nI haven't responded yet.\n\nP.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.\n\nDad told me to bring my \"partner\" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.\n\nI notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say \"*we* will check if *we're* free\".\n\nDad replies that \"this is family only\"\n\nI reply, \"I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones\"\n\nDad says \"that's different. Are you coming?\"\n\nI say \"we'll catch the next one\".\n\nDad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.\n\nI felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.\n\nAITA?\n\nInfo: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology. Of me and my siblings, 3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs, 1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she's #5 and dad gives the same story about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn't know until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down.",

        "text": "To start, my ex and I were 19 when she got pregnant. We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there.\n\nSo I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn\u2019t speak again. \n\nFast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle. \n\nHe was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. \n\nMy ex had backed out of the abortion but didn\u2019t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn\u2019t know about that. Apparently I wasn\u2019t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn\u2019t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn\u2019t properly care for her. \n\nHe asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.\n\nKara messaged me and we\u2019ve been talking. I\u2019ve met her twice and it\u2019s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we\u2019re just barely getting to know each other\n\nSo far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.\n\nWe met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.\n\nI had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn\u2019t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.\n\nThat night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They\u2019re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. \n\nYes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.\n\nSo right now I feel like shit. I get \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d but in this case I don\u2019t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I\u2019m still learning this whole \u201cdad\u201d business so don\u2019t know if I dropped the ball here.",

Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn\u2019t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son\u2019s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). \n\nSurprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister\u2019s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: \nMy ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn\u2019t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he\u2019s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fianc\u00e9 into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s best interest were my main priority. That\u2019s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. \n\nI asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn\u2019t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said \u201cI thought this was family only what\u2019s he doing here.\u201d Loud enough where he could\u2019ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. \n\nMy sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn\u2019t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn\u2019t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she\u2019s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn\u2019t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out. \n\nLike they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what\u2019s the point of us working it out if that\u2019s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I \u201cescalated\u201d the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her . AITA?",

Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along.

I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.\n\nThis woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.\n\nSo, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, \"Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?\" To which I replied, \"Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high.\" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. \n\nI came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure.

I\u2019m mostly a loner. I\u2019m fine with being single right now and have no interest in dating at the moment. My friend knows this. \n\nShe starts lightly teasing me in front of her friends, pretty much calling me a spinster. She \u201cdates\u201d a lot. Every week she tells me about two or so guys that she\u2019s slept with. This kind of started a pile on, where everyone was teasing me, and giving me unsolicited advice. I tried to placate it, but she kept bringing the conversation back to me and my (lack of) a sex life. \n\nEventually I got really heated, and just said \u201cso is your crotch still burning or is that cleared up? What did they say about that? Was it guy 104 or 105 that gave it to you?\u201d\n\nLike three weeks ago she called me crying to take her to the clinic because she had painful itchy blisters on her groin, turned out to be herpes. I did it without judging her at the time. \n\nShe quickly stood up and left the table. I tried to follow her to apologize and she went off about me outing her to her friends. She was telling me how I was the only person she trusted, and she couldn\u2019t believe I would act that way. I tried to remind her how she and her friends were dog piling me, and she said it was just jokes, I didn\u2019t have to react that way. \n\nWe are obviously not speaking right now. Was what I did justifiable self defense? I know I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it without liquid courage.\n\nEdit:\n1. I did ask her to stop, i was trying to keep things friendly. \n2.

I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable.\n\nI congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn\u2019t feel like our presence was wanted.\n\nWe left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little.\n\nAnne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should\u2019ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day.\n\nEDIT: typos\n\nEDIT 2 because there was some confusion:\n\nMy husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.",

I have read every response and I appreciate all the input.\n\nI have been putting off talking to my mom until Sunday\u00a0a week ago when I finally found a good opportunity to talk to her. I told my mom that I love her, that I didn't intend to hurt her by inviting Julia, and that I feel terrible for hurting her. I also explained to her why I invited Julia - this time she seemed to listen - and reassured her that me inviting Julia doesn't mean we can't have our own spa day or that I chose Julia over her because she is still my mom and I'll always love her. Then I showed her the websites of some spa places I had looked up beforehand and offered to pay for part of the costs. I know some people advised me against it but I think it's a small but important gesture to show my mom how much she means to me. My mom seemed really excited to go to one of them with me and said I wouldn't have to pay a cent.\n\nThen came the hard part for me. I told my mom that I feel like she never supported me in my interests and it hurts me that she can't even be bothered to show up to my tennis matches. I also expressed my feelings that I always felt like she wished for a more 'girly' daughter and how this hurt me. At first, my mom got pretty defensive. She tried to deny it, but I was adamant and in the end, when she saw how important this was for me, she apologized and promised to improve.\n\nLater at dinner, my mom asked me if I would like to go to a nearby climbing park with her and my step-dad in the future. I instantly agreed and was so happy, because going to a climbing park isn't something my mom would normally suggest. I feel like it means she genuinely listened to me and tries to truly improve our relationship.\n\nIt has been a week now since I talked to my mom, and I'm in good spirits as I hope our relationship will improve. I'm also hopeful we find our own mother-daughter thing in the future.\u00a0Thanks again Reddit for your input.",

        "text": "So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up.\n\nSo I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. \n\nI eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. \n\nImagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.\n\nHe then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.\n\nHe stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.\n\nWell it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA\n\nTldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.\n\nEdit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. \n\nOtherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. \n\nUpdate: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. \n\nPeople apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.\n\nI was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.\n\nSo not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",

        "text": "I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. \n\nOver the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. \n\nA few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. \n\nMy former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they\u2019d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They\u2019re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.\n\nLegally I\u2019m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. \n\nI\u2019ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn\u2019t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don\u2019t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn\u2019t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn\u2019t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.\n\nTl;dr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn\u2019t expect me to take it with me?",

He\u2019s rude, condescending, and we don\u2019t agree with him on a lot of things. \n\nNormally I just try to ignore him.

I make a lot of money and I\u2019m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I\u2019ve always wanted. \n\nUncle asked \u201cHow much are they paying you anyway?\u201d in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. \n\nI guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like \u201cOh, enough\u201d but I told him the number. \n\nHe started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. \n\nI got pissed and said \u201cI deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can\u2019t do what I do.\u201d \n\nWell, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle\u2019s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn\u2019t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now.

I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.\n\nRecently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.\n\nMy sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.\n\nIt all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.\n\nI asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nShe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'.\n\nI was just looking out for her.",

        "text": "\n\n\nI (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially \"Alessia\", she's in the same \"infertility boat\" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.\n\n\nAlessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.\n\n\nThe very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend \"Carol\" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because \"she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an \"inside joke\" between \"desperate infertile women\". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.\n\n\nSome friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\nso reddit, AITA?\n\n\nHello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me and\nAlessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.\n\n\nOh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed. She was kind of angry I used her real name but relieved that I used a throwaway LOL.",

I remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. \n\nthat was untill I found out the terms and conditions, I can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses I can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. \n\nso I told my parents that I cant accept the gift as I dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,I also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. \ni explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. \n\n this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. \n\nreflecting back I do think that I might be the asshole but I'm unsure so I've come to you. \n\nI will accept any judgment",

He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. \n\nSo, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn\u2019t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.\n\n2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it\u2019s extremely concerning that he\u2019s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. \n\nI went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, I didn\u2019t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\nUpdate: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong,she didn\u2019t hurt my brother and it wasn\u2019t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. \n\nAlso little info: this doesn\u2019t happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",

        "text": "My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.\n\nFor the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.\n\nIt's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.\n\nThis came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.\n\nI basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. \n\nI tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.\n\nAITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?",

        "text": "Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\n\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\n\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\n\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\n\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\n\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\n\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!\n\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!\n\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\n\nI'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",

And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

        "text": "To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. \n\nI brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones \"supposed\" to carry on our name.\n\nI think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?\n\n*UPDATE* \n\nDid not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands\u2014I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I\u2019ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) \n\nAs for my fianc\u00e9\u2014 he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He\u2019s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.\n\nThank you for all the encouragement! My fianc\u00e9 and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough.",

        "text": "UPDATE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy account was suspended due to some reddit error. Probably because I made a new throwaway and received a lot of attention I messaged reddit and the issue was quickly resolved. So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are here\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nA lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called \"ma'am.\" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages \"dear\" or \"darling\" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his \"true form\" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(original post)\n\nI(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI changed the oil to my own car\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeels like I can't even exist while she is here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say \"be safe\" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Throwaway account\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.\n\nWeeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.\n\nSince then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?\n\nJim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?\n\nUpdate 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.\n\n1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.\n2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.\n3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.\n4. Online he announced that I \"pushed out a dark skinned baby\" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.\n5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.\n6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a \"Welfare Princess,\" and how I was going to be just another \"baby mama.\"\n7. Just to clarify. Jim is \"white\" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.\n\nUpdate 2: Spelling Errors  \n\n\nUpdate 3:   \n\n\nMod denied separate post so it's here as an edit.\n\nThank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....\n\nFirst, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.\n\nI do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.\n\nThis was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.",

        "text": "My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was \"Chanukah\". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to \"Hanukkah\". She said to my daughter \"you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?\" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.\n\nI told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.\n\nThe teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.\n\nMy husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.",

We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said \"Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become.\" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.\n\nNow, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking \"how me and my dick knows about that\". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole \"women get looser\" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: \"Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.\"\n\nSo I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?",

        "text": "\nOne of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. \n\nAsking me to come over and \"have some fun\" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)\n\nHe also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. \n\nWhen I saw them, I was out with friends and was like \"What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem\". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... \n\nAnd I included dealing with this fucker as a \"workday problem\" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. \n\nOn Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:\n\n \"Hi 'Coworker'\n\nI'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)\n\nPlease only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. \n\n- OP\"\n\nI didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. \n\nAnd he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? \n\nI screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying \"As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack.\" \n\nHe stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked \"Is this a work question?\" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? \n\nHe walked off... \n\nI feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.\n\nAITA for sending that email?\n\n---\n\nEdit... \n\nLooks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. \n\nI'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.\n\nEdit 2... \n\n I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. \n\nIt's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? \n\nI do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.\n\nEdit 3...\n\nHoly shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. \n\nShe just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. \n\nI asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.\n\nI haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.\n\nEdit 4...\n\nHe was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. \n\nI owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",

That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. \n\nKim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. \n\nFor those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. But since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, I bought Jack a horse. My family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. \n\nJack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!\n\nThank you all for your comments and I wish everyone the best.",

Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.\n\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \u2018room\u2019 filled with something you\u2019re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. \n\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \n\nWhen I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\u2019t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\n\nI did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.\n\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\u2019t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\n\nI told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\n\nI\u2019m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",

I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.\n\nMy husband's (m37) best friend \"Terry\" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically \"tell on me\" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.\n\nLike I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.\n\nHe went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.\n\nInstead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.\n\nEdit: autocorrect.",

        "text": "I\u2019m going to try to keep this short since frankly - I\u2019m exhausted. Any questions can and will be answered in the comments. \n\nLong story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can\u2019t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.\n\nAcross from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven\u2019t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady\u2019s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. \n\nI. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she\u2019s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she\u2019s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It\u2019s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them, but not saying anything to the neighbor?\n\nEdit: Typo, and further explained question",

Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said \"a coffee, black\", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely\n\n\"Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, h\u00e8? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken\"\n\nWhich is Dutch and translates roughly to \n\n\"Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little\"\n\nThen he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. \n\nHe answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.\n\nI realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.\n\nI don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying. But maybe I shouldn't have because of the position I was in at the time (like customer service?) \n\nAITA?",

Its very childish and annoying and even other people asked her to tone it down, but she insists shes just joking. \n\nLast week she brought a homemade cake to the office for her birthday, and when she put a slice down in front of me i politely thanked her but i said i cant eat that. She said the cake is vegan and she made it specifically so i could eat it, but knowing her very loose definition of vegan i asked a few questions about the ingredients and she didnt check any of them for milk or eggs, so I thanked her again but refused the slice. She made a big scene out of it, she started crying and saying she just wanted to do something nice for me and now i ruined her birthday. \n\nSome colleagues told me not to mind her dramatics, but my boss told me that it was her birthday and i could have given her cooking the benefit of the doubt.

My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn\u2019t feel good about giving her Leyla\u2019s social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\n\nAfter explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn\u2019t have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.\n\nYesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.\n\nMoral of the story: Trust your gut on financial matters. While my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can\u2019t be too careful these days.",

(**NOT THIER REAL NAMES)**Levi and Charlie share a bedroom\nand Maggie has her own room as the oldest and also only girl.\n\nMaggie is a great kid. She does her homework, helps with chores without too much complaint, doesn\u2019t bug her little brothers (too) much. The issue is that she will not stop slamming her bedroom door. When she gets up to use the bathroom at night she slams her bedroom door on her way out and back in. When she gets up in the morning or goes to bed at night she slams it. Pretty much any time she enters or exits her room the door gets slammed. And it\u2019s only her door, none of the other doors in the house. It shakes the walls and frequently wakes up everyone else in the house. Her brothers room shares a wall with hers and our bedroom is directly above theirs.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I\u2019ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling.\n\nI told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we\u2019re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won\u2019t talk to us now. My mother says I\u2019m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn\u2019t have to deal with the house shaking.\n\nI want to add that we completely respect each other\u2019s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn\u2019t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can\u2019t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don\u2019t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We\u2019ve told her we\u2019ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\n\n1) The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and light\n\n2) The curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on.\n\n3) The door isn\u2019t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.",

It's 1 point if you are late, 3 points to call off with notice, and 5 points for calling off within 4 hours of your shift. This is fine with me as I have no points this year and have only called off once since 2018. I'm the type who covers shifts, stays late and generally just go to do my job.\n\nLast week, I ended up calling off and was out for a week due to being hospitalized in the ICU with a horrible infection. I let my boss know at 2am that I was being sent out by helicopter and kept her informed of everything going on. Today was my first day back. I'm not 100% yet but like many places, we are short staffed. When I came in today, I opened and got to work. My boss came in 2 hours later and called me into her office. She informed me I was getting 8 points, losing my discounts and bonuses for 90 days, and was on probation. I was dumbfounded and told her I wasn't signing the papers as it was out of my control. She said if I didn't, I would be terminated. I told her not to bother and walked out. \n\nI'm now getting calls and texts from her and my coworkers saying they need me and I was an ass for quiting over something so small. My husband thinks I was in the right because it was ridiculous that I was getting punished for almost dying.\n\nAITA?",

I mentioned on the last post that I'd had some offers from competitors, and while most paid about the same, they required a step down in my career. A few of you pointed out that if I can earn the same money *after* a step down, something isn't matching up. I did some research and came to the conclusion that I am being overworked and underpaid. I also triple checked all my notes for the last 7 months of leave, and calculated that I had worked for 87 days out of just over 200. That was where I hit my limit.\n\nI then reached out to some of the people who had made offers previously, and asked if they could give me a formal offer. 3 of them did. My favourite has fewer hours/responsibilities and *more* money, and they're fine waiting on me to finish up my planned maternity leave (9 more weeks) before I start.\n\nI had a 'check in day' scheduled for later this month, but pulled it forward to Monday and asked my cousin and a few others to be there. I laid out all of the above. I was open to negotiating in a way that would let me stay in the company, but my cousin flew off the handle, and after that we agreed that me staying was no longer an option. As I have 9 weeks of leave left, I will hand in my notice, meaning I will not come back to work, but I will be paid for this time, as well as compensated for the leave I lost.\n\nMy cousin has blocked me on everything, but his mum has called my mum, who has been yelling at me for 2 days. I've had to block my own mother. My cousin is attempting to rally our entire family against me, but I have nan on my side, so he is not succeeding. I am **never** working with family again.",

He's been doing live streaming a lot lately even though I told him that we have responsibilities to take care of. Before our daughter (she's 7 months old) was born he'd stream randomly and spend lot of time with his \"followers\". Answering questions and engaging in conversations. He keeps saying that his followers are good for his mental health and that engaging with them weekly makes him become better at socializing and communicating.\n\n\nHe's been complaining about wanting to do a live stream for days. I told him we'd look at our schedule and see if we could get him some time to make it happen. Apparently, this wasn't good enough. Yesterday I had to go grocery shopping and asked him to keep an eye on our daughter while she was asleep. He said okay.\n\n\nI was gone for 4hrs but kept calling him to see if everything was OK. He'd tell me she was alright and that she was sleeping. I started getting this weird feeling something was wrong because, she must've had been hungry or needed a diaper change. He argued that everything was fine. I immediately went home and when I entered the house I didn't find him, I shouted his name but got nothing. I went into the bedroom and saw that my daughter was awake and her diaper wasn't changed...and worse was that her bottle was even touched. I was confused I got out and noticed that his office's door was closed. I figured he was doing a live streaming from the noise I heard. I was beyond seething I barged into the office and saw him sitting. I blew up while he was trying to turn his mic off and telling me to stop but I didnt stop. I berated him for leaving our daughter unattended and with no milk nor diaper change. He freaked out on me saying I just ended his entire channel and destroyed his fan base for interrupting his live stream and embarrassing and scandalized him like that. I told him to not say a word but he kept yelling calling me out of control and unhinged. He was almost crying so I had to leave the office.\n\n\nHe kept fighting with me til I decided to go stay with my mom. He started blaming me for ignoring his needs after he already expressed them and that he forgot to do what I asked him and I'd cost him so much. Now us telling to come back home because he misses his daughter.",

        "text": "UPDATE at the bottom \n\n\nEdit2: Since many people are sending me DMs, me and my dads went to the principal today. Will post an update when the situation is solved. \n\nEdit: please remove if not allowed mods. I\u2019m talking to my dads today and will ask them to got he principal with me  , the comments here made a little sacred about how wrong this could go and how bad was the situation. Will post an update if things can be posted online. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not in USA, even if this sound fake to you,  here in South America things are really this bad guys. \n\n\u2014-\nFor a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). \n\nI\u2019m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I\u2019m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I\u2019ll call Duncan (15m) found out. \n\nDuncan started simple with jokes like \u201cwow which one of them is the mom?\u201d Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient\u201d. \n\nDuncan started to escalate with \u201cEnjoy your time here, it\u2019ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell\u201d and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was \u201cYou can\u2019t be prejudiced with his religion, it\u2019s wrong in the Bible. He\u2019s is just trying to understand.\u201d\n\nIn my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn\u2019t go to another btw. \n\nI have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. \n\nSo when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mufasas\u2019 Death. The Fox and The Hound. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. \n\nThe scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. \n\nWhen we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy\u2019s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.\u201d He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. \n\nThen later Duncan\u2019s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I\u2019ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I\u2019ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m wrong, but with Mr.Smith\u2019s warning and Duncan\u2019s friends I\u2019m starting to doubt , so AITA?\n\nFINAL EDIT AND UPDATE\n\n\nMods told me to update here so the post is quite long, sorry!\n\nFirst I\u2019d like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to how bad the situation was and how it could get worse, and how I was hurting my dads by not letting them protect me like I want to protect them. \n\nNow to the update: Sunday I sat my dads down and told them everything, I was crying a bit  in the end since while telling them I realized how heavy it felt to be carrying all this.\n\nSunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn\u2019t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. \n\nHe told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. \nHe thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. \n\nAdam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. \n\nTheir conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. \n\nMy dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. \n\nShe choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won\u2019t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. \n\nApparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. \n\nBut he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don\u2019t have the support we got this time.\n\nSo, nothing really extraordinary, it all went like many of you guys predicted: Duncan will keep being my classmate but at least Mr.Smith won\u2019t bully any more of us, he was the real asshole in the situation. \n\nAlso my Papa is awesome and a badass.",

I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.\n\nThe other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nI asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?\n\nETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again.",

        "text": "\nI'll start this off by saying that I, f32 have been with my husband Bob, m39 for 3 years, married for one. His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of \"you work too much\". Not true because sometimes I do make myself available but yet find myself excluded. \n\nLast week. His mom invited us for a celebratory dinner at the restaurant after she completed her recovery. I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I'd be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. \n\nThing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chairs had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. \n\nI was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom watched with their eyes popping out of their heads like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. \n\nI had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way out. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront of her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn't his nor his mom's fault guests arrived \"before\" me and took all the available chairs. I told him he could've saved me a chair!!!!!. he said that I could've just left instead, and reminded me that I was a \"guest\" and that I shouldn't expect this level of entitlement to be \"accepted\". He then went on about how I ruined the entire dinner for him and his mom with what I did and has been pouting about it for days now.\n\n\nI don't get it, I really don't. was my expectation really that entitled? I mean as his wife he should've saved me a seat. But clearly I'm missing something here.",

        "text": "My (25F) nephew (4M) passed away 1 year ago because of cancer. It was right on my birthday and there was no celebration, there was nothing, because everyone was devastated. \n\nMy sister Denise is still grieving, she's in therapy and making some progress, but it's been slow. My family and I try to be as supportive as possible. \n\nBirthdays in my family are very important, we throw huge parties, I believe and have been taught that birthdays are important and should be cherished. \n\nYesterday was my birthday. Obviously I felt bad about the anniversary of my nephew's death, but I was also a little down about not being able to celebrate like I used to and my girlfriend knew that. \n\nIn the morning, I went to Denise's house, stayed by her side until almost lunch time, when my mother would stay with her (we didn't want to leave her alone, but no one could stay all day). \n\nI went to work and at night, my girlfriend made a surprise at home with a candlelight dinner and a small cake. Something very intimate and for both of us, since my family was in a bad way. \n\nI didn't post on social media, but my girlfriend posted a picture of us holding hands and the dinner she made with \"Happy Bday, Love\". My mom and Denise follow her on Instagram. \n\nI woke up the next day to hundreds of texts from my mom and Denise, asking if I was celebrating even though it was such a sad day and how heartless I was to celebrate knowing my sister was in such a bad way. Even though I said it was a surprise, they called me cold, heartless and insensitive to the pain of others, saying I should have refused to celebrate. \n\nI was just glad I celebrated, because it's something important to me and I didn't even realize when my girlfriend posted this photo on insta. \n\nBtw, in case you were wondering, none of them remembered it was my birthday. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. \n\nSince all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\nI'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",

She is my only sister's only child.\n\n2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.\n\nMy MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).\n\nI didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.\n\nLast week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.\n\nWhile I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said \"I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts\". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).\n\nThe next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). \n\nWe did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.\n\nPeople in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",

I out of curiosity asked if I could come. My husband felt hasitant but I told him it'd be a great opportunities to get to know his family better. He agreed to take me and his family were surprised to see me but still welcomed me.\r\nOn the 3rd day of the vacation. His dad, mom, brothers and spouses were all sitting at a table outside talking while I was preparing a fruit salad. As I was making my way back I overheard my MIL say \"...did she really had nowhere else to spend the weekend?\". At first I had no idea who she was talking about so I kept on walking, but stopped once I overheard my husband say \"l KNOW!!!! And I didn't want to bring her with me but what was I supposed to do?!!! You know how pushy she can get\". I instantly figured it was about me. I felt so shaken up to the point where I almost dropped the salad. This whole time I was there I cleaned, cooked, looked after the kids and this is how they think of me? An inconvenience to them?.\n\r\nI quietly booked a ticket and went home on the first plane. He called and texted but I didn't respond anything other than let him know I was home. He got back and went off on me saying what I did was disrespectful and juvenile. I told him I overheard the conversation he had with his mom but he said that I was wrong for eavesdropping and that his family will warm up to me on their terms so I should stop pushing to be around that when they don't feel comfortable with it. Basically saying it was my fault for coming along in the first place. He said that going home like made him and his family disappointed and gave them a really bad impression about me.\n\nI think that I might have messed this up and someehat ruined it for them as well.",

However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.\n\nThey said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.\n\nAnyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open\n\nMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. \n\nRight now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.\n\nSo I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.\n\nAnd that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.\n\nAITA for what I did?",

I just want honest feedback.\n\nMy wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we've been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. \n\nAnd it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm \"useless\". \n\nThis all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.\n\nShe got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?\n\nEdit: my wife does get breaks, guys. I set up the annoying foot bath thing every night while she does dishes and then she relaxes with it while watching YouTube every night while I put the kids to bed. She also won't eat my cooking because she grew up in southeast Asia and doesn't like American food. It's not my fault she's picky.\n\n\nEdit 2: it's a Korean BBQ meatloaf she makes since some people pointed out meatloaf is typically American. Anyway, my wife found this post and now she wants us to do couples counseling. Thanks for the feedback, guys.",

        "text": "I am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.\n\nMy dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.\n\nThis wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.\n\nI thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.\n\n---\n\nI said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.\n\nBut it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. \n\nI suggested we make a \"Swear Tax\" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...\n\n----\n\nSo my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.\n\nI know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. \n\nIn the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.\n\nMy dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??\n\nI feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to \"want the family to learn not to cuss\" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.\n\nAITA for having the idea for the \"family swear tax\" after my dad got angry at me for swearing? I did it because I know I swear the least out of my family but I was the only one getting in trouble for it",

She\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s borther\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nI (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We\u2019ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they\u2019ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn\u2019t know was coming).\n\nShe seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it\u2019s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.\n\nI looked at her in disbelief, I couldn\u2019t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?\n\nAnyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she\u2019s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.\n\nJake didn\u2019t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?",

They've done stuff like forcing him to play chess 4 times in a raw, secretly slashed his tires to see if he'd fix it himself like a man or get help like those \"lazy\" guys, They'd asked him questions like what joke he'd like to tell his future MIL, his opinions on abortion, jesus, gender equality etc. They also tested his fishing and hunting skills, overwhelmed him with hypothetical scenarios to test his decision making abilities/mental strength. They kept calling him slow and soft but he has medical condition (asthma) but they think he's making 'excuses'. I demanded they stop, but dad said this is just typical stuff men challenge each others with and said that I was ruining the fun.\n\n\n\nLast week, They took Tim on a 3 day trip and hid his inhaler, he left them and returned in 7hrs and told me, I was seething after he said they admitted to hiding it as a \"challenge\", I exploded on them when they returned. Cousin asked if \"little timmy ran to me to tattle\". I yelled that all 4 of them are uninvited to my wedding. My brother freaked out saying it was a prank and they were going to give it back, Dad said they'll apologize if I insist but Tim will have lost the little respect they'd gained for him and in their eyes will always be \"the soft college kid\" who's not up for the challenge. I called him and the others awful then I left. \n\nMy cousin is begging that we talk, my uncle has been quiet, but dad is so mad and now he's getting mom involved to get me to reconsider this decision. But I keep refusing to re invite them. Mom is saying I'm exaggerating and should let bygones be bygones and not let this ruin my relationship with my family.\n\n\nAITA? For making it my hill to die on or am I exaggerating?",

Her cousin came to us and wanted us to do all the signage, banners, guest books, life-sized cutouts, etc for her wedding. \n\nWe do this all the time for friends' weddings and events, and we never charge. We're happy to help out and it's usually a lot of fun working together to make some cool stuff.\n\nA few weeks before the wedding, her wedding planner tells us they need all the items by X date so they can set it up for the wedding. At this point, we hadn't received our wedding invitations and didn't even know when the actual wedding was. \n\nMy wife texts her and tries to clarify when the wedding is and if we missed the invitation somehow. Her cousin replies and says \"Oh we downsized the wedding and we decided to have like a close friends and family thing\" and that they didn't have space for us in the small venue.\n\nMy wife and I are pretty hurt and insulted. And on top of it, we've spent close to $2000 on all the materials. Her cousin and the wedding planner kept making tiny revisions to the artwork, had us print samples to see how it would look in person, resized several of the items a few times, etc. All that cost a ton of time and money. And we're a functioning business, so we either had to delay other orders or stay late and print her stuff on our own time.\n\nSo I went ahead and billed her for our cost and said we needed payment before delivery because I'm not going to chase her for payment for months/years after the wedding. We're not making money on it, just charged her for the cost of materials. \n\nSo far we've gotten threatening calls from the cousin, her fiance, some random members of my wife's family that I don't know, some of the groomsmen, etc essentially calling us assholes.\n\nAfter the harassment, I'm considering charging full price or else we won't deliver the items. \n\nAre we the assholes here? Sorry but I'm not going to waste my hard earned time and money on someone who doesn't even consider us \"close friends and family\"",

I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)\n\nAs punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.\n\nAnyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.\n\nIt was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.\n\nI know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.\n\nI don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.\n\nSo I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.\n\nSo now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.\n\nI said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it. \n\nAITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?",

His parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. On arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. Outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.\n\nIt's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. We've tried telling them we wanted \"alone time\" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. We also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. My husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.\n\nWe've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. We still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. There's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than \u00a360 total. We could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.\n\nIt's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.\n\nWould we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?\n\nUpdate: our train should be arriving in our final station in the next 30 mins, we've found a hotel that's able to take us tonight, and we are very excited about the next 4 days",

        "text": "Throwaway.\n\nMy brother, \u201cPaul,\u201d and I are not close at all. We have very different worldviews and have incompatible personalities. I can tolerate him, but I would never consider him a friend. He\u2019s been married to \u201cLisa,\u201d for one or two years now and they have a beautiful daughter together.\n\nMy girlfriend, \u201cAmy,\u201d and I were invited to celebrate my niece's first birthday. Most of the family was invited, and it would be the first time I would have seen them all together (I only see my family once or twice a year, with a few exceptions.) \n\nAmy and I arrived a little earlier than we were supposed to and instead of waiting in the car, we decided to go in. The first thing I noticed is how calm my brother seemed to be in contrast to Lisa, who was frantically running up and down. When he saw Amy, he immediately handed the baby over to her and got a beer to sit down and watch TV. Lisa was clearly struggling, and he was content with a beer and Netflix. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be rude and maybe this was a one-time thing but it bothered me how uninvolved he was. He handed Amy a baby with a full diaper with vomit on its clothes.\n\nEventually Amy, Lisa and I finished everything. The house was clean, the food was ready, and Lisa looked ready to host a big gathering. We all paid zero attention to Paul. \n\nWhen my family arrived, I thought everything was going well. I avoided Paul and enjoyed speaking to my family. After we had sat down to eat, Paul approached me, drunk, thanking me for helping Lisa. I did not want to be around him for long and moved out of his way.\n\nHe was very persistent.\n\nI was ignoring him but he started talking about Amy. \u201cProtect Amy like a \u201creal\u201d man.\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great woman by your side.\u201d You know what, whatever. It was slightly odd and mildly uncomfortable, but I was able to brush it away. Amy was trying to sober him up a little bit before the cake-cutting so she was \u201cselectively hearing.\u201d \n\nWe tried to get him to stop talking and drink water. However, he had a lot to say about Lisa. He was complaining about how pregnancy \u201cruined\u201d Lisa\u2019s body and how a baby ruined his life. Amy and I kept looking at each other awkwardly and we were soon going to leave him be. \n\nWe didn\u2019t leave the conversation soon enough.\n\nHe was complaining to be about his sex life, or lack thereof,  and commenting on how desperately he wanted to have sex with someone \u201cfit like Amy.\u201d \n\nThis made the both of us extremely uncomfortable. Amy left, quickly apologising to Lisa. I told him that he was a \u201cdisgusting, gross man who needs some fucking help,\u201d before I left. \n\nApparently, this made him super upset and he started wailing at the party. Paul told everyone that the reason he was crying was because of my words to him. He got over it quickly, but a few people told me I was wrong to shame a father on his child\u2019s birthday. I could have probably left without making a statement. AITA?",

        "text": "Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. \n\nSo I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nAbout six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. \n\nSo the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nMy potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?\n\nETA: some questions people keep asking: \n1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and \"just do\". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. \n2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) \n3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.\n4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",

        "text": "eta: I made cupcakes using some tips you guys gave me and omg it was so much better (not as dry as they were before), thank you. <3\n\nI saw a lot of messages and comments wanting an update so here it is. I'm sorry if I didn't get to your message, there were so many of them so I thought i'd make a post instead. I got a little overwhelmed (:\n\n**TL;DR:** You guys were right, I am NTA. I used your advice and moved out (after confronting Nate about his behaviour)\n\nAfter reading what everyone wrote I quickly realised that what Nate did was so so wrong. A lot of great moms in the comments also helped me understand the fact that even conservative moms (like Nate's) wouldn't react so rudely. It hit me like a wave when I realised what my life had come to. I didn't say anything to Nate about the post but he must have figured out that I was upset at him. I was doubting our relationship and pulling away from him. He started talking to me again and for a day I didn't really say anything. But I knew I had some decisions to make. I genuinely didn't believe I would get so many responses telling me I was NTA so this was eye opening for me.\n\nSo a few days after I made the post I told Nate that we needed to talk. I said that I would be staying with my friend until I felt comfortable around him. He didn't know what I was referring to (which just made me angry because how can he forget a fight that big) and I told him I was upset with how he treated me after the whole \"your family walking in on me\" incident. I also mentioned how I shouldn't have to wait for him to be away to dance, bake or listen to one direction just because he doesn't like it. He tried convincing me to stay but I left. I think he knew I wouldn't let this go like the other things (thanks to you guys)\n\nYesterday I asked him to meet me at a cafe so we could have a conversation about everything that happened. Nate cried. Like for the first time ever since I have known him. He apologised, told me he messed up, and that he would change because he realised his mistakes now. I told him I wanted to move out and maybe after a while, if he does actually change, i'd give us another chance. I just needed some space to think about things and so I told him we should take a break from each other for a while. Nate told me he would talk to his mom as well and that he should have defended me to which I said yes you should have. I actually borrowed direct sentences (to explain why he in the wrong) from some comments you guys left because it was so helpful. It went better than how I imagined it would go.\n\nAlso, thank you. Thank you doesn't even begin to cover what I really want to say to everyone who helped me and also to the mods who removed a lot of creepy comments. Thanks for sharing your stories about dancing in your underwear as well! It made me feel better to know I wasn't some freak for enjoying those things. I'm going to use those baking tips you guys gave to me and make cupcakes right now actually because I can. I feel so relieved. <3",

        "text": "About three years ago my dad was injured in a really bad hit and run car accident. He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable. \n\nIn November I\u2019m getting married. I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don\u2019t want to be reminded of what could\u2019ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we\u2019re incredibly close. \n\nShe naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA?\n\nUpdate - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn\u2019t okay. I\u2019m going to call my dad tomorrow\n\nUpdate 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you\u2019re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you\u2019re just as bad as I apparently am if you\u2019re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet\n\nUPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I\u2019d give you all an update. My boyfriend and I have decided to part ways and ive apologised to my dad",

In that post it was determined that I was the asshole. \n\nA LOT has happened since then, so I decided to make an update.\n\nAfter reading your comments, I decided that I probably took it to far and although I was embarassed and felt violated, at the end of the day, it is her body and not mine. Just because we look the same does not mean I get to have a say, nor should it affect our relationship.\n\nSo, I called her and told her I wanted to talk and we had a really long emotional discussion and I obviously decided to not kick her out as long as she was able to cover her rent going forward.\n\nThen, Covid happened. And as of June, I no longer have a job. I was one of the newest people at the company I was working for and so I was one of the first to go.\n\nAnd in a turn of events, my sister who has been killing it on onlyfans, is now covering for my portion of the rent until I am able to get back on my feet.\n\nSo, thank you for your advice. I might have ruined my relationship with my sister and maybe even be homeless without it.",

I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because \"she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.",

        "text": "My husband and I have a 7 year old daughter together, Layla. A few months ago, Layla got a \"boyfriend\", Lucas. They are both 7, so it's obviously not a real relationship. They just hold hands sometimes and they drew each other hearts for valentines day.\n\nThis week, Layla was apparently holding hands with another boy - who also sent Layla a valentine's day love letter - and Lucas took offence to it. We found out because Lucas' parents called to tell us Lucas won't be coming over to us this Saturday like it was originally planned, because he is mad at Layla.\n\nMy husband wants us to punish Layla and wants me to have a talk with her about faithfulness. At first I thought he was joking, but no, he was serious. He says that Layla cheated on Lucas and I, as her mother, should do something about it. \n\nI told my husband that Layla is 7, not a cheater and I won't treat her as such. He then accused me of \"raising a cheater\" and encouraging the bad behaviour. AITA for not wanting to punish Layla?\n\nEdit: typo",

As soon as Lauren walks away, Mark is laying it on thick with compliments, and asking when our lease is up. \n\nI wear a lot of body-con and sometimes low cut clothing , so I expect to get glances maybe mild staring. But this guy is very obviously hitting on me, and often times in ways that make me uncomfortable, especially since he is always at our apartment. \n \nI have told Lauren several times that Mark hits on me, and she just rolls her eyes. She doesn\u2019t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. \n\nSo yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to \u201chumor\u201d me. \n\nMark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. \n\nHe sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me. Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.\n\nShe came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*. Saying I saying I tried to seduce him and that I dressed like a slut. And I\u2019m like \u201cI *always* dress like a slut Lauren! Who cares! Your boyfriend is hitting on me!\u201d\nWe argued and both said some shitty stuff to each other. \n\nShe and Mark are staying in her bedroom and we haven\u2019t spoken to each other since. As I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m wondering if I am an asshole for even trying to do this but at the same time I think she sucks for not believing me in the first place. \n\nI live in New York. I love my neighborhood I don\u2019t want to have to find a new roommate because of this idiot. If I did an asshole thing please tell me. AITA",

        "text": "I need an unbiased opinion on this because I don't know if i was the asshole.\n\nThrowaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.\n\nSo I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.\n\nI had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to \"take my power back\" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.\n\nThe problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of \" you can change the worst memories\" or some shit like that.\n\nMy sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of \"oh well if you are not using it i will\". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.\n\nNow my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to \"take my power back\"\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking me\n\nEdit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party? Do you know how relationships work. Are you also going to tell me that if he cheated on a Saturday it wouldn't count? Or if he left the country? This is hilarious coming from a sub that says cheaters are the worst people In this world.

        "text": "Just recently my husband (31) was promoted to assistant manager of the warehouse. We both work on the ups of 50 hours a week. I am shift manager at a behavioral disorders facility. Both jobs are very hands on and strenuous. \n\nSince his promotion he has developed an entirely different attitude. Extremely entitled and dare I say rude as all fuck. He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. \n\nSo, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after \"working so hard\". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say \"wheres mine?\" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say \"I worked all day\" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he \"makes more\". \n\nLast night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says \"babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!\" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said \"Did you hear me?\" \n\nSo I responded with \"Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself.\" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said \"But I worked all fucking day!\" So I snapped back with \"Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself.\" \n\nHe is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. \n\nAITA? Did I push it too far?",

At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.\n\nUnfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.\n\nSo first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.\n\nWell that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.\n\nWe agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.\n\nI have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it.

I went to the school and requested it back, saying I wouldn\u2019t give it to my daughter but I paid for it. Secretary gave me the spiel and I didn\u2019t blame her but asked to speak with the vice principal. He comes out and repeats them. I said okay but I\u2019m the parent, I paid for it and I never signed anything giving you permission to hold it. They were refusing so I said I\u2019d sit in the office until it was given back. I did so and waited for close to 2 hours. Finally the principal came out and said I needed to leave. I said if I left, I\u2019d be back with a police escort. At that point, the phone was returned to me.\n\n\nMy husband says I \u201cKaren\u2019d\u201d my way out of it. To me, it\u2019s not their property to take. AITA?",

        "text": "\nSo I recently got together with a guy from my hobby, he asked me out first and I had some doubts that we'd work together as a couple because of the age difference, he's 35 and I'm 22.\n\nSo, in my apartment, since it's an old house that was originally a single family house, there isn't much soundproofing. And the floors creak when people move. \n\nI've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.\n\nAnd the sound of the girls in the apartments to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. \n\nI know when I play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. So I'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. \n\nSo... When my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. Which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and I said no. \n\nFor example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. He wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her TV. I said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. \n\nAt 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. I said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. \n\nAt 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. I offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.\n\nHe had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. \n\nI got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him \"you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! I don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... Hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!\" \n\n(The 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)\n\nHe got irritated and asked why I was bringing age into it, and I said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! And he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.\n\nHe got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when I'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with \"ok boomer\" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a \"rich person apartment\" he could pay for it. \n\nAITA for what I said to my boyfriend about my apartment?\n\nEdit - A lot of comments are asking if we could stay at his house\n\nIt's not possible for me to get to his house on my own because I don't have a car and the buses don't go that far into the suburbs. \n\n So that would mean him driving 30 minutes from his house in the suburbs to pick me up, then an extra 30 to drive me to his house. Then an hour round trip early in the morning to get me home in time for work. \n\nIt's a lot easier for him to visit me in the city.\n\nEdit 2 - a lot of people in the comments are saying Technically 35 is a milennial and not a boomer. I know that.\n\n I am using boomer as A JOKE or a figure of speech to say \"acting out of touch and entitled to tell other people what to do\". It is a common figure of speech to say \"ok boomer\" to someone who is acting entitled regardless of their actual age... It's more of a mindset thing.\n\nEdit 3 - I googled his property records for his house and HE CO OWNS IT WITH A WOMAN WHO SHARES HIS LAST NAME! holy shit... I don't know if she's his wife or ex wife or what but I'm OUT OF HERE. I'm honestly freaking out right now but I just gotta say .. great big thank you to everyone who noticed red flags and made me question that. I've blocked his number, he can have fun figuring out where I went.",

He's currently out of work (used to work at a high paying job but got kicked out the company over a fight with a co worker) and I'm the one paying for rent and utilities.\n\nWe dedicate some time to see his family weekly. They don't know he's unemployed because he thought they'll see him as a failure especially his mom so he told me to keep it a secret.\n\n\nLast night we were sitting eating dinner at the table. His cousin was talking about his fiancee going to brazil to do a boob job. Jared asked if he was serious then \"flattered\" FSIL's boobs saying they're perfect and that he didn't understand why she'd get a boob job. He then turned to me, stared at my chest while I was eating like an idiot (I have a flat chest, I'm insecure about it but can't do anything about it obviously) and said \"Hey why don't YOU get a boob job, you're the one who needs it the most\". His mom gasped and was like \" JARED!?? \" I said \"It's fine!\"\u00a0 I then turned to him and said \"I'll get a boob job once YOU get an ACTUAL JOB since you've been unemployed for 6 months now$!!\", He stared at me in disbelief. his mom began questioning him about being unemployed and he denied denied denied then admitted it was true. It got awkward with his mom scolding him and others shaming him for it and for hiding it. He got so overwhelmed he went outside and stayed inside the car til I came.\n\nHe started yeling at me repeatedly \"you coudn't have held your effing tongue?!!\", And accused me of turning his family against him and having them jugge then shun him now he can't even step a foot in their house from shame and guilt. I argued that his comment about my chest was insulting, but he said he was giving me a piece of advice and that there is nothing wrong with him wanting me to look pretty and that he said what he said out of support and encouregemnt, but I what I did was the complete opposite and that it was intented to hurt him and I succeeded.\n\n\nHe dropped me off at home then went to stay with his buddies. I called him later thinking he calmed down but his friend said he didn't want to speak to me and I shoud give him space.",

        "text": "For several years I was a stripper. I have no shame about what I did, and only quit when I got a better job offer. In the time I worked as a stripper, I intentionally lived as cheaply as possible (shitty little studio flat, living off ramen, wearing old clothes) because my coworkers all told me that they were able to buy their own places on their income, so long as they saved like crazy. Before I \"retired\", I managed to outright buy myself a 3 bedroom flat. I rented out the other rooms for a while but I got sick of having roommates, so now I have them up online for shorter stays, but not to rent.\n\nI met this guy about 18 months ago, and we've been together since. He knows about my employment history, and he said that he has no issue with it, though he did ask me to tell his family the white lie I occasionally use (on my CV and stuff), which is that I was a waitress (which I kind of was tbf).\n\nA month ago we found out that I'm 2 months pregnant. He says this is great news, and we should move in together. I assumed he'd be moving into my place because he rents his (far smaller 1 bedroom) flat while I own mine, and I have room for a baby's room while he doesn't. Also, I really don't want to leave my flat. It's my flat, I love it, I could see myself living here for the rest of my life, and I don't want to lose the security of owning a flat and have to go back to paying rent or a mortgage each month.\n\nHowever, he then said that he didn't want to move into my place, and said I should sell it and we buy a place together. I said that I like my place, it means a lot to me that I was able to buy it, and it represents years of working my arse off scrimping and saving. He then said that he understands all of that, but we should be living together by the time the baby comes and he didn't want to live in my flat. I asked him why not - it's a great flat, it's central to everything, it's spacious, it's got room for all his stuff, there's a daycare in the building (run/owned by another tenant) and a school 5 minute walk away, the list goes on - and he said that he didn't want to live in a flat that was bought with \"stripper money\".\n\nThat really pissed me off, and I told him no fucking way am I selling my flat and that he never had an issue with my \"stripper money\" paying for this flat before now. I said I wasn't giving up the security of owning a home for someone who tries to make me feel ashamed about something I don't feel ashamed of. He said that his point is if I sold the flat then we could get a new place with the money from the sale. I said \"wouldn't that still be stripper money?\" and he said \"that's different\", and I asked how. He then said he was going back to his place because \"I can't talk to you when you're in this state\".\n\nHe's gone back to his flat now and he's texted me saying I'm overreacting/irrational and I need to think of this realistically rather than emotionally. He says he wouldn't feel right raising a child in my flat knowing how I purchased it and selling/moving is the best idea of all of us, not to mention the fact he isn't on the deed because it's my place and it \"would never feel like our place\" because of this.\n\nI feel I might be the arse because I get why he might feel like it's just my place and I feel I'm being too rigid in a time we need to work together, plus I spoke to my sister and she sided with him so 2 out of 3 people think I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate on the off chance anyone sees this: I dumped him. There was a whole conversation and during the conversation he said he didn't want to be a parent if I wasn't willing to do everything he wanted, including sharing a house/deed (plus staying together). Also, at the start of the conversation I said what a few people suggested, which was that I'd be willing to sell and split the house with him, provided he paid 50%, and he got very very angry, very very quickly. He also said a few other things, so IDK how it's all going to pan out just yet, but it looks like I'm going to be a single mother.",

She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an \"aggressive breed\", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.\n\nIt's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being \"dangerous\".\n\nI'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.",

I'm a sahm (full time) and I take care of the kids while my husband works (full time).\n\n\nMy sister's wedding was last week. We live hours away which is an issue for my husband. When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn't going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same. Since the wedding doesn't allow kids and my husband doesn't want to hire a babysitter after the one we had robbed us. We had gone back and forth on this. but I insisted on going since that's my only sister and I want to attend what might be a once in a lifetime event for her. He chuckled at my statemtment then we stopped talking about it.\n\n\nAs the wedding was appraoching, He brought it up and told me to miss it and stay with the kids. I suggested that since no babysitters were allowed then, I could get my friend to stay with the kids but he refused. I ignored him, spoke to my friend who agreed to watch the kids and booked a ticket to travel to my sister's town in time.\n\nMy husband found out and went on about how he had work, and that the most logical solution is that I stay home with the kids and let him make his living. I told him that I already took care of the kids and they'll stay with my friend. Honestly? I grew inpatient. The day of my flight I dropped the kids off at my friend's place then headed to the airport. I found out he had canceled my plane ticket. I was upset but still insisted on going so I went home and got into my car and drove 4hrs to get to the town.\n\n\nAt 5pm. My husband called and was freaking out on me asking where I was. I told him I made it to my sister's town and he blew up saying I wasn't supposed to go, even said he canceled my ticket to get me to stay. He demanded I return but I said not until the wedding was over. He called me horrible, neglectful mom then had his mom scold me and accuse me of abandoning my own kids. There was a huge argument ensued when I returned home and my husband kept on saying I was horrible to leave the kids and to ignore him like that and do what I wanted eventually. He's giving me silent treatment as of now and I can no longer take it. I felt guilty and did NOT enjoy the wedding AT ALL.\n\n\nWas I wrong for still going?\n\n\n\n[INFO] My husband dislikes my sister if it's relevant.\n\n\nUPDATE: So a lot of people on here brought up the possibility of my husband lying about the robbery that happened months ago and accusing the babysitter of stealing just so I can't hire any other babysitters. He was the one who discovered the \"robbery\" I never saw or talked her after he kicked her out. Upon reading the comments I'm now suspecting that he made this whole thing up. I'm going to contact the babysitter to get the whole story from..Hopefully I'm wrong but I will talk to her and see if her story contredicts his in any way.\n\nI'll keep you updated.",

He\u2019s stupidly competitive about it and quietly insults beginners who are not as good which makes me feel self conscious because I\u2019m a beginner. \n\nLast night we were at the climbing gym again and he was doing a V6. There was about 6 people taking turns on the problem probably because it\u2019s a newly installed route and they were all failing. Then a girl came and flashed it. She made it so easy but at the end she didn\u2019t hold the final hold for 5 seconds and my bf called her out after she was done. Holding the last hold for 5 seconds is suppose to be the \u201cright way\u201d of finishing a route but she was doing it so easily she definitely could have. I think he was just being salty because she did it when he couldn\u2019t. She laughed and told him he didn\u2019t even start the problem correctly and walked off. I gave her a high five because she was walking towards me and did amazing at the problem (and knocked my bf off his high horse) and she was surprised but high fived me. \n\nMy bf turned to me and gave me a wtf look and wouldn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the night. When we were heading home he ranted that I couldn\u2019t be trusted to watch his back if I chose to take a stranger\u2019s side over him. I was shocked that\u2019s what he took from the climb and told him she shouldn\u2019t have nitpicked her when she clearly climbed it correctly and he got mad and argued I was suppose to take his side over people I don\u2019t even know.",

My sister was visibly bothered but she didn\u2019t say anything. As expected, everyone including my parents were too upset to think about him being there and were still welcoming towards him. They didn\u2019t speculate or react the way my sister thought they would. I knew they wouldn\u2019t. We were all focused on my brother. \n\nIt was a beautiful service. I\u2019m glad M was a part of this and that my brother got a proper send off. It was very difficult and it hurt so much to say goodbye. I really hope we did right by my brother and it was how he would\u2019ve wanted it.\n\nThank you to whoever suggested an urn necklace that M could keep some of my brother\u2019s ashes in. I brought this up to him and asked if that was something he wanted. I was going to get part for myself while my parents kept most of it. And then I would just split the ashes with M.\n\nM didn\u2019t know that was a thing but said he liked that idea. He got himself a beautiful pendant to keep the ashes in and he really loves it so thanks again to the person who commented this! It was a lovely suggestion and it means so much to him to have a piece of my brother with him at all times. \n\nI have still kept contact with M since the funeral. He\u2019s stopped by a couple times and has finally met my wife and daughter. I also try to see him when I have the chance just to make sure he\u2019s okay. This has understandably taken a huge toll on him. He told me he\u2019s started talking to someone to help cope with the grief, which I think is great. \n\nI myself had a bit of a wake up call that therapy was something I very much needed right away. My wife brought it to my attention that our 5 year old has noticed I\u2019ve stopped eating and now she doesn\u2019t want to either unless I do. \n\nDon\u2019t know I guess I haven\u2019t been able to eat because I feel like I don\u2019t deserve it if that makes any sense. \n\nIt hit me that what I\u2019m going through was starting to affect my family so I\u2019m currently looking up grief counseling in my area. I\u2019ve also made an effort to eat more in front of my daughter so she knows that I\u2019m fine and it\u2019s okay to eat, hiding the fact that it still makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nThings are still rough and wounds are yet to heal but we\u2019re all surviving. Thank you everyone for all your kindness and support. It was very reassuring to know that this was the right thing and M deserved to be there. Thinking back now, it should\u2019ve been a no brainer but emotions were high and it was better to get an outsiders perspective. I appreciate everyone\u2019s input and I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

Decided to shoot my shot and we spoke and danced for a bit and I offered to buy her a drink and she gladly accompanied me to the bar, when I got there I was like can I have a beer and whatever she wants. She promptly says can I get 4 double shots of 1942. Thats like $75 a shot for a double of 1942 and I was like wtf and she said there for her friends and patted me on the back. When the bartender came back I slapped a $10 bill on the table and told him she'd be covering the shots and walked away. She was pissed and yelling the normal insults lol. \n\nWell it turns out my mom works with her and they were talking and my mom showed her a picture of me (god damn it mom!) and she instantly recognized me and remembered my name and told my mom about what I did. My mom then called me and said I'm a huge asshole and told me to send her the cost of the 4 drinks which was like $325 with tips. \n\nI just laughed and told my mom I'm not doing that and my mom said that the girl thinks I'm a huge asshole and douche and she agrees LOL. \n\nAITA?",

The trashcan has a lid and there\u2019s a plastic garbage bag in there, so the pad was touching nothing but the trash that was already inside. \n\nI genuinely didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, until my boyfriend took out the trash this morning and noticed the plastic wrappers in the bag. He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. \n\nI told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.\n\nI did, but then asked him where else I should\u2019ve put my pads and he told me I could\u2019ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. \nI\u2019m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn\u2019t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell\u2026).\n\nHe stated that he didn\u2019t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.\nI don\u2019t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn\u2019t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he\u2019s quite set on his opinion.\n\nI think he was a bit childish because I don\u2019t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.\n\nEDIT: typos",

        "text": "My (25F) girlfriend, Molly (26F) for the last... 6 months started with a joke that I've already made clear that I don't like. It consists of her saying \"No\" quickly to anything I ask.\n\n I know it sounds silly, but I ask her to get a glass of water for me, she says no and after 1 minute, I'm almost getting up, she says she's joking and gets some water. I ask her to wash the dishes, she says no.... I say I LOVE YOU, she says no... I ask her to take her clothes, she says no. Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is \"addicted\" to doing it.\n\n I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me). And there are things that are serious and I need her to answer seriously. And if she says no to everything jokingly, I can't tell when she's saying a real no (it's already happened). \n\nI keep saying this is boring and I don't like it, she stops doing it and goes back to doing it after a week. After a brief discussion because she played this prank in front of our friends (Me asking \"love, can you get me some medicine?\" and she with No kidding), she stopped doing it for 1 month. \n\nYesterday, we welcomed my parents, in-laws and our 2 best friends to our house. Everyone knew that I was going to propose to her and I called them, because we always planned this proposal with our loved ones attending, participating in this special day. \n\nI asked her to marry me and she said a quick NO and I was so grumpy/panic/upset (everyone looking in shock) for 30s for her to laugh and say she was joking, finally saying YES. \n\nI was so embarrassed and\u2026disappointed? I put the ring box back in and said I'd take it out to cool off. I didn't even let her say anything. \n\nShe kept texting me (no answering calls), saying it was just a joke and that I knew she always did that. She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke. \n\nWell, I slept in a hotel and I'm still in it. \n\nMy parents supported me, but my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.\n\n I just really think there's time for jokes and that moment wasn't clearly, she knew I didn't like it and decided to do it anyway. \n\nAITA?",

Everyone kept telling me things will get easier with time.\nI know that no matter how much time goes by I'll still be missing my baby and everything sweet about him.\nMother in law and I were in constant conflict. Things always been bad between us but in those months we reached our limit. She kept getting involved in my son's treatment., and criticized every decision I made claiming I didn't know how to handle my son's illness. We went low contact but she kept causing issues occasionally. My husband was torn between our son's illness and his mother's issues. \n\nWhen my son passed away she came to the funeral and caused a scene by arguing with me knowing I had no energy for it. She used the fact that everyone was there so she could say it was my fault my son was born sick and I didn't take care of him properly, that I didn't listen to her when suggested other ways to treat his condition. And That I was the one who took their grandchild away from them and caused them heartache. She then loudly called me a bad mother I had no idea how I kept my composure and kept standing on both feet. My mom and sisters responded by telling her to leave.\nmy husband was sitting down crying.\nShe then went to tell everyone I kicked her out as a way to hurt her further and lied that I convinced my husband to ban her from visiting her grandson's grave.\n\nMy husband later sent his side of family an email talking about my mother in law's behavior during and after our son's illness and telling them he no longer will be seeing her. That had the family criticizing us saying mother in law was just trying to do what was best for her grandbaby and called us selfish for assuming we're the only ones struggling with this tragedy.\n\nWe haven't seen his mom in 1 year and 8 months.\nI'm now 3 months pregnant. No one knew only my sister in law (brother in law's wife) but word got out. Though we told her not to say anything.\nWeek later I had family members saying I was invited to a dinner hosted by mother in law so she could both apologize in front of the whole family and settle this issue before the baby's born. They said mother in law was regretful, and offered to financially provide for her grandbaby and they want to see that.\nI refused\nBut My husband surprisingly wants me to go. I had his grandparents calling me telling me that I'm a person with a good heart and forgiveness's something I'm capable of giving. I told them I'll never be sitting at the same table with the person who called me a bad mother at my child's funeral. I still remember it vividly til this very day. My sisters said this change of heart from mother in law is probably for the new baby. It could be but I insisted I won't come. They're saying I'm making hard for everyone to move on and past this unreasolved pain and should really go.",

        "text": "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \nHe told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out. \n\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

        "text": "Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we\u2019d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn\u2019t find out until 20 years later. \n\nTori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he\u2019s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. \n\nHe\u2019s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It\u2019s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he\u2019s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it\u2019s been completely different since he found out about Chris.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn\u2019t matter. Any time we\u2019d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I\u2019d ask him how classes or friends were and he\u2019d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn\u2019t even mention it to me until a year later. \n\nI told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he\u2019d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.\n\nWhat was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris\u2019 because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I told him this \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are going to do this. That\u2019s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I\u2019m no longer your Father and I don\u2019t want to be involved in your life.\u201d \n\nHe hung up on me. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn\u2019t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he\u2019s 22).\n\nMy family told me I\u2019m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it\u2019s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?\n\nINFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn\u2019t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn\u2019t contact me. I didn\u2019t contact them. I needed a break.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he\u2019s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. \n\nI never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. \n\nI told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son\u2019s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this \u201cAdam, you haven\u2019t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn\u2019t sit well with me. That\u2019s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I\u2019m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.\u201d Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. \n\nHe was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex\u2019s affair. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",

        "text": "This happened on Halloween and the day following.\nMy neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. \n\nMy apartment complex didn\u2019t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.\n\nResidents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional \u201cknock on door, physically hand strangers candy\u201d was not permitted.\n\nSo, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn\u2019t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.\n\nThe next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded \u201cnope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night\u201d \nI was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.\n\nShe said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a \u201ctax.\u201d\n\nHer son then chimes in and said \u201cyou only took two bags from us!\u201d \nshe responded with \u201cbut I\u2019m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax\u201d \n\nI was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said \u201chey, aren\u2019t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. \u201c\n\nI explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.\n\nShe was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. \n\nNow she\u2019s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won\u2019t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.\n\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn\u2019t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.\n\nEdit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn\u2019t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. \n\nAs for the authenticity of her vegansim- \nI may have exaggerated when I said \u201csuper vegan\u201d when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it\u2019s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan \u201clifestyle\u201d if that makes sense. \n\nNow for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it\u2019s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can\u2019t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.\n\nI think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can\u2019t be vegan and not know these things. I\u2019m not vegan, I\u2019m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. \n\nAbout the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)\n\nEDIT #2 \nI cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren\u2019t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn\u2019t have told me what was actually wrong. \nTurns out he was calling me an asshole cause she\u2019s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven\u2019t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I\u2019m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn\u2019t stop. \n\nI also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.",

Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) \"Britney\"\n\n\nSo, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite.\n\nOlivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted.\n\n\nAt the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made \"slight changes\" to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no \"excuse\" to show favoritism and that her daughter is \"watching\" and \"observing\" how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine.\n\n\nMy wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be \"selfish\". I said that my daughter gets to act \"selfish\" on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now.\n\n\nAITA for returning the cake and not taking my wife's input into consideration?",

        "text": "\nMy mother-in-law calls every night to ask what we're having for dinner. Then she brags about what she's cooking to make me look bad, especially if we're getting takeout. I used to care but not anymore. But my husband would ask me to make dinner only for him to go eat the dinner his mom makes at her home. which's 10 minutes away and using the \"that's my favorite meal\" excuse.\n\n\nYesterday, I wanted to surprise him by cooking one of his favorite meals and although I was busy, I took time off work to cook. I even went grocery shopping to get what I needed. Later as I was setting the table his mom called, I told him he didn't have to answer but he did. like usual...she asked what we were having but acted surprised that I cooked this meal. She then went on to tell him she cooked X meal and told him to come over. He said ok which shocked me, I said \"seriously?\" as he started dresing up getting ready to leave. he told me no offense but this meal (that his mom cooked) was even more of a favorite than the one I cooked. and grabed his keys and left.\n\n\nI felt awful. I took his plate and threw it out then ate my portion. As I was about to put the plate in the dishwasher, he got home looking angry saying his mom lied about cooking that favorite meal, and used it as an excuse to force him to eat dinner with her. I was shocked but he sat down telling me to go ahead and reheat dinner. I told him no dinner after he abandoned it, I threw it out. He said what?? and I told him he disrespected my time and effort and chose to go eat woth his mom instead. He began yelling at me asking if I really did that then called me petty and horrible then went upstairs saying what I did was 100 times worse than what his mom did.\n\nI definately feel like I let my anger and frustration get the best of me but it really felt unbearable having to live like this for so long. By the way [I'm 26 and he's 28].\n\nETA to make one thing clear and that's the fact that my husband only does this when it comes to food. He lived with his mom (attended community college) and loved and still loves her food and is used to it. She gave me recipes to make and I try to do that but he keeps switching homes just to eat what he feels like.\n\n\n\n**UPDATE** Hi \ud83d\udc4b I posted my situation here almost 24hrs ago and haven't really read every single comment because - Wow there's just too many. I saw few pieces of advice and encouregment and I'm so so thankful for them \ud83d\udc9d. But just wanted to let you guys know something since this is a throwaway account and I will be abandoning it soon. I just wanna let you know that I will be sitting down with my husband soon (after he breaks the silence I'm just giving him the space he said he wanted) and I'm going to show him this post in hopes he'd see how none of this was my fault. I will also be pushing for couples counseling although he's always been against it but we'll see how things go...I'm not gonna lie I still feel upset and like my efforts aren't being appreciated, His mom is definately onto something with her little upsetting stunts. I realize how important boundaries are - but also realize how enforcingbcan he difficult. I'm hoping and praying that we will tackle this issue so that our marriage won't suffer but if he's still somehow unable to do his part then that's on him and I'm no longer willing to go through similar stuff and just take it you know.\n\n\nSo yeah, This is it. I honestly didn't realize my post was going to gain this much attention. I might add my original account just in case some of y'all wanted to talk (got plenty of time and space for internet besties because my INBOX was blowing up lol) and maybe I will post updates from there if I could. Thanks so much \ud83d\udc9d.",

It turns out that some of the more pessimistic of you were right, Jane was being obsessive and stalkerish and it sort of all came tumbling down on her at that point. A week or so after I made my post she decided to message me, well it came down to her not understanding why I was showing interest in her and then refused to date her(I never showed interest in her beyond basic friendliness.), A wall of text dedicated to thrashing my previous relationships and calling them all sorts of names, specifically pointing out how I dated the \"Wrong girls\" and a weird rant about how everyone agreed me and her were meant to be, which just isn't the case, like I said in my previous post, there is a running joke in our friend group about how weird she is.\n\nNow, you might think this is something that can be expected, something that just happens, an outlet for her of sorts, except, she send it from the wrong account. See, I had become internet friends with a person In the past month or two, me and her would game together, chat from time to time, you know, the usual organic internet friend situation. And the messages concerning out \"Date\" were sent from this account, turns out she had literally used this alias to infiltrate my \"internet\" friend group and keep tabs on me of sorts? Obviously this freaked me the fuck out, I took screenshots of what she had sent me and afterwards blocked all accounts that I knew now she was using.\n\nI followed that up by sharing everything in our friend discord and in our friend whatsapp group, so everyone could see which resulted in her being kicked from both and I later got a call from Joe full on apologetic, telling me he had no idea and he knew he shouldn't have done it but that his girlfriend was being pressured by Jane, turned out, Jane had literally been bitching at her for months to arrange something like this and she finally caved, again creepy stuff, I told him that I needed some time as he really fucked me over bigtime and I didn't trust him anymore as a result.\n\nWhile Jane has been shunned by all friends, she still contacted me twice, once to apologize which quickly turned into weird shit where she started talking about \"Us\" she seems convinced there is an us and I am interested and another time just to curse at me, both from random accounts. I am not sure where to go from here and I am still pretty shook up.",

My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.\n\nMy father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.\n\nSince both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.\n\nShe was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.\n\nMy wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.\n\nI have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?\n\n**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.  She is a powerful advocate of LGBTQ+ rights so she had an angry knee-jerk reaction to my dad's bigotry.**",

I was planning to share an apartment with my old friends, but my parents wanted me to move in to help them out.\n\nCovid has hid them hard and are struggling to pay their bills, so they wanted me to move in and pay rent. I said ok because I wanted to help them out. It all went well until 3 days after I moved in. My mother came in around 9 PM, saying 'I had enough screen time and need to go to bed'. I thought this was ridiculous, because I'm an adult paying rent, they have no right to demand this. She said 'your living under my roof, I make the rules'. I went along with it for the night, and the next morning I went and took my laptop back from their room. She proceeded to ground me, for 'disobeying her authority'.\n\nI had enough of this, called the people I was going to room with and asked if they still had a spot. They said yes, so I packed up and moved in with them. Now my family is hounding me for 'not supporting my family'.\n\nEdit 1: Hello! When I posted this, it says It was removed, so I just left it. I went on the sub yesterday and saw that this actually went through! Im going to go and respond to comments now.",

Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.\n\nHis SIL \u201cKay\u201d (39) is the one who is \u201cknown\u201d for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they\u2019re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because \u201cthey are not Kay\u2019s\u201d.  Yes, I\u2019ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  \n\nTo be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete\u2019s family agrees.\n\nWe had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. \n\nWe got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they\u2019re in car and I\u2019ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay\u2019s.\n\nAfter we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay\u2019s.  She didn\u2019t notice at first and then asked if they weren\u2019t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.\n\nKay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That\u2019s when I said, \u201cOh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.\u201d\n\nHer husband said he hadn\u2019t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said \u201cyeah, they were okay.\u201d  Kay didn\u2019t say anything the rest of the night.\n\nPete thought it was funny (he didn\u2019t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay\u2019s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I\u2019m just mad that Kay is a better baker.  But Pete said it\u2019s ridiculous the family, including Kay, puts down my baking when they won\u2019t even try it all because I\u2019m not Kay. AITA?\n\nETA:  We aren\u2019t the only two who bring desserts, just the ones who tend to bake cake more than others.  Everyone else\u2019s desserts get eaten to some degree except mine.\n\nEdit 2:  If it\u2019s not clear, \u201ceveryone\u201d includes Kay.  She has often tried to \u201cteach\u201d me techniques that I either already knew or were completely wrong.  So she wasn\u2019t like an innocent that got caught in the line of fire or something.",

        "text": "My brother died before his firstborn child was born, because of this I've had an above average involvement in my nephews life. One thing I\u2019ve always done is build him toys and furniture. It was a way of providing without the awkwardness of handing over cash. Also, between my late brothers cash and life insurance via work a trust was setup for my nephew for ~\u00a3500,000. He wasn\u2019t actually married to my SIL.\n\nNow via the lab at work I\u2019ve made him a lot of wooden or 3d printed toys, but also some simple handmade electronic toys. My sister in law was always grateful for these and my nephew (by all accounts) loves his custom toys.\n\nFast forward 3 years and my former sister in law has gotten married. I was attending my nephews third birthday and I turned up the night before to assemble his present. It was a small climbing frame/Swing set I had watched better carpenters than me in the lab make.\n\nThe new husband was a little standoffish but come the day of the party he was telling anyone who listened that I didn\u2019t pay or make the present I had lackies at work do it for free. This culminated in him calling all my \u201cpresents\u201d an embarrassment and given my fancy job I could afford to splash some cash.\n\nI confronted him and my former SIL and she basically confirmed that whilst the presents were appreciated she honestly expected more direct support from me after my brothers death. My mother stepped in and reminded her my brother paid for this house and they regularly take cash out of the trust (approx \u00a310,000 a year).\n\nWe walked out without hearing any worthwhile response but I continued to see my nephew without incident. 6-7 months go by and I\u2019m visiting only to be told my former SIL was pregnant with twins and she was wondering if I could make some duplicates of items I made for my nephew as they needed two sets.\n\nI scoffed, said she had balls asking me to make stuff after she was so ungrateful and I owe her unborn children very little. She got upset and explained her prior statements about my handmade gifts and said she felt they were the kinda little things someone did as a favour. Not what a family provides. That\u2019s why she\u2019s asking me now as a friend to do her a \u201cfavour\u201d and manufacture duplicates.\n\nI said no, again, and her husband shouted through that it didn\u2019t matter they would just use the trust to provide for kids like it\u2019s supposed to. I retorted that it was for my nephew and good luck accessing it for that because the trust requires my signature to pay out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even home before he was calling me to apologise, clearly unaware I held the reigns to my late brothers money. The apology was insincere and I asked to speak to my former SIL where I confirmed again I wouldn\u2019t be manufacturing her anything. I\u2019ll still be an uncle to my nephew and be impartial when it comes to her accessing my nephews trust but her husband has burned a lot my goodwill with this.\n\nAITA for not doing her a favour after all that?",

My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",

My roommate is friends with these two girls call them Kate and Jess, and they invite with them a new friend call her Ashley. Now Ashley when she comes over I see that she is recording us, I thought she was just posting to her Instagram and Snapchat. I don't pay attention to any of it really. \n\nI notice that she is just video taping a lot, so I am like Kate can you check on your friend like whats going on? Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting \"Evidence against us.\" When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. \n\nBut I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. \n\nSome of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her.",

        "text": "I\u2019m currently in medical school and live across the country from my brother/family. I was surprised when his fianc\u00e9 asked me to be a bridesmaid because I barely know her, but she wants to have all siblings in the wedding. I made it clear that their wedding was during my final exam week, and while I was able to get an accommodation to take my last two exams early I still wouldn\u2019t be able to help much with planning or be present at things like a bachelorette party/bridal shower. She said this was fine, it would mostly just be to have an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen and for pictures.\n\nThere\u2019s a group chat that was created months ago that I would read through every couple of days to get updates on things I needed to do, namely to order a bridesmaid dress. Links were sent with three styles to choose from and we would be updated on colors later. So a couple weeks go by and I ask what color to order, bride says she still thinking about it. Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking\u2026 then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it\u2019s at the point that if I don\u2019t order this dress in a couple of days it won\u2019t be here in time. So I ask on Saturday what color. No response in the group chat to me.\n\nI asked again yesterday (Sunday) what color do I need to order? Then I\u2019m flooded with messages lambasting me for not ordering a dress yet, from her sisters and my sister and her. My sister called me, told me to \u201cget my sh\\*t together\u201d and \u201corder a dress already\u201d because my lack of preparedness is causing the bride intense anxiety because she doesn\u2019t think my dress will be here on time for the wedding now. She texted me this morning, \u201cdon\u2019t forget order your dress, love you\u201d with smiling and kissing emojis.\n\nStill, no one has told me what color! I\u2019ve scoured the group chat for a mention of dress colors or an image of a dress but only the maid of honor sent a photo of her dress and I don\u2019t know if she has a special color. There\u2019s thousands of messages so it\u2019s not simple to find anything. Everyone else can meet in person so I assume the decision on color was relayed in person. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being purposefully excluded?\n\nAbout an hour ago my brother called me pleading with me to work things out with the bride because she\u2019s panicking about me. I tried to explain this to him and he told me he doesn\u2019t care, its a petty ladies issue, and since I\u2019m not there for anything else this is the least I can do because the bride thinks I don\u2019t like her because I wouldn\u2019t come to anything. He\u2019s taking her side. They know I\u2019m in medical school, I have literally no say in my schedule. And I\u2019m on the other side of the country, 5.5 hours by plane.\n\nI\u2019m fed up with them and contemplating telling my instructors the wedding was moved and I will take my exams at the regular time. I\u2019d have more time to study that way anyway. I haven\u2019t told anyone in my family I\u2019m considering this. WIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I called my mother and asked her what color the bridesmaid dresses are, she said lavender. The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride\u2019s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn\u2019t remember the shade name but its a \u201cdusty purple\u201d then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was \u201cmulberry.\u201d On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.\n\nI sent her a screen shot with the list of shade names and asked, \u201cwhich of these?\u201d She said she didn\u2019t know because everyone ordered their dress so long ago and asked for pictures of the dresses in different shades from the website. So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was \u201clook, I don\u2019t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.\u201d\n\nI ignored the lecture/comments and asked: \u201cwhat color?\u201d\n\nHer response? \u201cLight purple\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cof the three I sent, which one is it?\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cI don\u2019t remember, I\u2019ll have to ask one of the other bridesmaids for her receipt, I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d\n\nI want to bash my head into a wall!\n\nI called my second brother, the one not getting married. He said they\u2019re pulling similar things with him and he feels like he was deliberately given the wrong dates for the bachelor party by the best man (bride\u2019s brother) so that he would miss it. He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn\u2019t have missed much since he probably won\u2019t enjoy any of the \u201cfestivities\u201d anyway. They\u2019ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he\u2019s been ignoring but he thinks they\u2019re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n........\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick update: I was seriously considering pulling out, but the collective rage here and my fading motivation to study has me thinking\u2026 by this point, with how this post took off, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they find it at some point so I don\u2019t want to reveal my cards just yet. Thank you to the comments that gave me the idea. I guess I\u2019ll be making an update mid June if it all goes to plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFINAL UPDATE\n\nThanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color \u201cflint\u201d one in \u201cmulberry.\u201d The MOH was setting me up to believe \u201cmulberry\u201d was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a \"mulberry\" dress.\n\nI caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress. The bride begins crying because it\u2019s \u201ctoo late to fix it!\u201d She asks if I would be upset if asked to drop out because mulberry is for the MOH.\n\nI pretended like I had made such a big mistake! I said, \u201cI know a girl that works at the salon. Let me call her and see if there\u2019s anyway to make it right, and if not I\u2019ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.\u201d I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. \u201cMy friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds! Exact style, color and my size, it\u2019s a sign!\u201d\n\nSilence. Then an awkward, \u201cthat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest, I thought the revenge would be that they had to have me and younger brother in the wedding and photos. I couldn\u2019t have planned the next part. They had to explain to the makeup artist there was an additional bridesmaid meaning they planned from the beginning that I wouldn't be in this wedding.\n\nThe ceremony went fine. We took photos after.\n\nThen, there were no place settings for me and little bro with the wedding party at the reception since banked on one less bridesmaid and one less groomsman being present. The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn\u2019t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.\n\nBefore he (groom) left he found me and said he asked the MOH why the setting were wrong and he was told I asked to be dropped from the wedding party weeks ago then showed up and demanded to be in the wedding.\n\nI said I didn't ask to be dropped and showed him my phone where she gave me a thumbs up on the dress. He noticed the screenshot was not the dress I was currently wearing so I said I had to last minute switch it out after confusion on the color. He seemed satisfied with that.\n\nThey left on their honeymoon, and my brother returned several days early\u2026 alone. So, you can guess how that went.",

They asked if we *even still* considered having a wedding. I said why not but they were very upset especially mom and dad who said they've always been known for their decency and good christian values and weren't willing to let this \"stain\" their reputation. as in my wife and I getting married while pregnant. They officially dropped out and refused to negotiate saying it was done and I have only myself to blame for this outcome and should move the wedding out of town. I was hurt I tried to change their minds and checked with other members but;\n\nMy brother said he had no intentions to look like a joke infront of his fellow church members and dropped out, My aunt pretended to be sick and said she may not be able to make it, She's 100% healthy, My cousin said he had business trip and stopped his wife and kids from attending and my uncle cussed me out, torn the invitation and kicked me out.\n\n\n\nI felt terrible with no family members of my own to support me and share my joy at my wedding. I even broke down crying after the ceremony. I haven't spoken to them for months and then got busy with my 4 weeks old daughter.\nMy cousin reached out to hand me gifts and well wishes for the birth of my daughter sent from my family. I returned everything. He sat with me on behalf of the family saying I shouldn't have returned gifts that were from my family who want to see and hopefully be involved in my daughter's life. He said mom',s longing to meet her grand baby and everyone else is wanting to visit soon to celebrate my daughter's life. I asked him this question, I said wasn't my daughter the reason why the entire lot of them abandoned my wedding?. He just stared grudgingly as I went on about how they treated my daughter as something to be ashamed of and hide (my daughter at some point will ask about the wedding and I have no intentions on lying to her). He replied saying he *guaranteed* I got it all wrong and nomatter what goes down between us I can never deny that my daughter is their granddaughter/niece/etc and they're her family. He asked that I arrange for them to visit but I refused. He kept pressing the idea but I shut him down. My wife says I should let them come but I still refused.",

They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. \n\nMy sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.\n\nI don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. \n\nWhen Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. \n\nAmy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. \n\nThe final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. \n\nI was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. \n\nUnfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. \n\nAmy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.",

She is a horrible self slcentered person who thinks she is the main character.\nShe is not only a horrible person, she is a step monster.\n\nShe married this guy... Who is a freaking push over... 3 years ago. He has two children. 10 and 6. My sister constantly complains about them. Saying things like the 6 year old is gross because he sips too loud or has stained clothing. For the love of god.... He is 6. That's what a child is supposed to do. And she is so mean to the 10 year old girl. She acts straight out jealous of her. I've caught her taunting her, that daddy loves my sister more than her. She is horrible.\n\nI have straight up called her out (after trying to talk to her like a million times) . At Christmas she was saying, that I'd be nice to have the kids there and I said \"why... You hate them?\". This was when everything was almost over and she had been bragging to her friends that her husband had spend more on her than on daughter. A fight ensued. My parents reprimanded me but my cousins took my side and called her out, noting every moment that they had witnessed her being horrible. Her husband obviously took her side and said, that she was a wonderful step mother and that the kids love her. To which I said that was a lie, as I had consoled them countless times after they were taunted by my sister. They left and we haven't talked since.\n\nOne day I was running errands and run into my step nephews who were with their mother. I had never met her... And honestly she is wonderful. We decided to have some coffee. While the kids were playing, she asked me how her children behaved etc. I said they were wonderful and then I just spilled the beans on my sister. How awful she was. What I've heard her say to the kids, the inaction of her ex husband. By the end she was horrified. She said the kids didn't like her. But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father's life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I'd be willing to \"testify\". She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim. Am I the asshole?",

Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.\n\nWell, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name.

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. \n\nLast weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. \n\nI thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. \n\nI felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family.

She left at around 7:45.\n\n10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now.\n\n11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset\n\n12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry. \n\n1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read.\n\nAround 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry.\n\nAt 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time. \n\nI immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did. \n\nMy fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise. \n\nMy fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again. \n\nSo did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for informing me everyone. I am aware that my ex is posting deranged nonsense in the comments. I won't respond to them because I've made it a policy not to engage with her.",

It's been like three weeks and many, many things have happened. I graduated high school (go me!), I turned 18, and I moved out! I finally feel like I'm adulting, kind of. I moved in with my sister the day after my birthday, and I've been living with her for a bit over two weeks. It's been really weird.\n\nThey do all of this stuff in her house that we never did as kids. Family dinners every night? Never done it once until now. My sister and her fiance carve out blocks of time to spend with the kids! My parents never did that. My oldest nephew (he's 10) dropped an open can of pineapple in the kitchen a few days ago. I expected him to get yelled at, but my sister just helped him clean it up and told him to grab a new can from the pantry. That was weird. My parents were never that chill.\n\nWhen I was a kid I would see these perfect families on TV, (shoutout to dinosaur train lmao) and my parents always told me that those kinds of parents didn't exist. That it was all made up for TV. That real parents don't take that much of an interest in their kid's lives and interests. I believed them until now.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I've seen my sister and her fiance spend hours making model planes with my oldest nephew, or rocking the youngest to sleep when she was overtired. That stuff never happened when I was a kid. My niece (she's 4) woke up in the middle of the night last week, crying about something. Instead of telling her to stfu and go to bed, my sister's fiance got up and sat with her until she fell asleep. I guess I was just surprised that my experiences aren't the norm.\n\nAnyway, both my brother and I are doing really well here. My brother has been cooking a lot (he's going to culinary school), and everyone seems to really appreciate it. I've been spending time with my nieces and nephew and I have played more Minecraft these past two weeks than I think I've played in my entire life. If anyone knows what Titanfall 2 is, please help me out. I've been an adult for less than a month and these children and their new-fangled video games already confuse me.\n\nThis is all just a very long winded way to say thanks. If I hadn't posted here, I don't think I would have moved out. My savings would basically be drained, and I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. So thank you. Now I guess it's time to see if I can figure out how to do an update post.\n\n\n\nEdit: Shoutout to my sister for basically raising me for twelve years and also being an amazing parent. I could just go and say all this to her face but there's so many stairs in this house and I'm lazy. \n\nKalani. How many times am I going to have to say it before you accept that you're a good person? Every time I go to thank you for giving up space in your house for me and Cam, you say that if you didn't help us out, it would have been someone else. I get that you have strangely low self esteem (as evidenced by your AITA post) but can you just accept that you're an unbelievably good person and move on so I can finally thank you?\n\nEdit #2: I have enough advice on Titanfall, thank you guys. I didn't realize it had such a big community. I now know how to beat every single campaign boss plus why I should definitely use a Scorch in the last boss battle. Thanks.",

        "text": "Hi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.\n\nHowever, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.\n\nBut, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.\n\nShe got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.\n\nSome of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into \"streetwear.\" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?\n\nI think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.\n\nThat being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.\n\nParenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement.",

        "text": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\n\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\n\nedit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually.\n\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\n\nEdit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\n\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks!\n\nEdit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

She went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. She came back and brought him food upstairs. When I asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn\u2019t anything important and told me to drop it. I got kind of upset because I want to know what was wrong and I\u2019m his parent as well. \n\nI haven\u2019t been fully ignoring them but I\u2019ve been acting kinda distant since yesterday.

If he wants one he can save up and buy one.\n\nHe then comes to me with a budget on how we can \u201cafford\u201d the system. It was mostly just that if I buy nothing for myself for 2 months, we\u2019ll have enough for the system. I told him hell no, it\u2019s offensive and if he wants the system he has to save up for it.\n\nThen he comes back with another budget. He and his father calculated how much I\u2019ve been paid in child support over the years and they decided it would be a good idea to let me know how little a drop in the bucket the gaming system would be. I told him I spend that on his expenses every month but he didn\u2019t believe me, so I told him that if he doesn\u2019t think so, he can pay me for his expenses every month and I\u2019ll give him the child support.\n\nSurprise surprise, when I gave him the bill, it showed that when you factor in all of the things I pay for in a month, it\u2019s much more than child support. Child support doesn\u2019t even cover 30%. Now my ex is yelling at me for making our son feel like an expensive burden, but I think I was teaching him a lesson about money and unteaching him some of what my ex says about support. AITA for giving him a bill?\n\nETA: not able to comment, but just wanted to say this isn\u2019t a question of being able to afford the console. I can afford it, but that doesn\u2019t mean he should just get it.",

Basically, I know my field.\n\nI speak a few langues and teach a group of people outside of work. We meet up once a week and talk in that language. We are all friends and it's very casual. Last week one person of the group asked if they could bring a mate (K) from work who's interested in the language too. She said that her mate is on the spectrum and that he might not know when to stop talking. I said bring him along and we'll see how he fits in.\n\nThe actual lesson went well and I think we were all happy. Usually some people stick around for a bit after and we just have a few drinks. This is when it started. As it turns out K is interested in my field of study. He asked me some questions and I was happy to answer. But then it started getting weird. He kept arguing with me and \"correcting\" me, telling me what I apparently misunderstood and so on. It was quite awkward and my other friends tried to gently let him know that he was probably out of line. He kept asking me about my opinion on studies and papers but in an aggressive almost questioning way. \n\nThe last straw was when he told me that I misinterpreted the findings of a study that I was a co author of. I was sick of it and said \"listen buddy, I know you think that you know everything about this field but if you had actually bothered to read who \"et al\" is then you'd know that I wrote this fucking paper so please just shut up\" not my proudest moment I admit but at this point he'd been trying to \"beat me\" for over 30 minutes. He left after that but later messaged me that he'd inform my uni of my discriminatory behaviour towards people with autism.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I went too far.\n\nEdit typo",

Every month he and his friends go on a road trip. His car's been sitting in the garage for 3 months now. He asked if he could take my car to take the guys on a road trip since it was his turn to take them. I told him I need the car since I have a weak immune system and public transportation might be risky. And I can't afford to get sick in the middle of my exams. He begged saying his friends are gonna say he ruined the trip and our discussion got nowhere.\n\n\nThe trip was last week. I had an exam the day of the trip and left at 8am. I had several things to do. I stopped by the coffee shop to use the internet. I arrived at the university at 8:30 and entered the hall getting ready for my exam.\n\nAfter I finished. I spent few minutes with my friends then I left. I got to the parking lot and my car wasn't there, I started freaking out. Thinking I might've left the door open or something. I called my husband but he didn't pick up. My friends immediately told me to call The Police. I ended up waiting for them to ask me about what happened. The Officer said I needed to come to the station to give my statement.\n\nI stayed there for 4 hours then I was told my car was found. my husband was driving it and was picked up an hour away from where we live. I was shocked. And mad. It never occured to me that he was the one who took it. I went home and waited til he got back. He was upset and didn't want to talk about what he did. The argument started after he said he made a copy of the key and didn't take til he made sure I arrived for my exam. I yelled at him and told him it was not okay. He caused me to stress out and worry about the car. He told me calling the police was drastic and shouldn't have gotten them involved but I had no idea he took the car. He said he wanted to text me but forgot. Said the trip was ruined and he was embarrassed by being picked up by the police while he was with friends. He still thinks calling the police was over the top reaction but what was I supposed to do.",

        "text": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hryyi6/aita_for_threatening_to_ban_my_brother_from_my/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFirstly, thank you all so much for the crazy response on my original post. Totally unexpected, but very much appreciated by my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nAs I mentioned a couple times in the comments of my original post, my fianc\u00e9 and I wrote up a Facebook post to explain the situation to our families (mostly mine), including screenshots of texts with my brother (I decided I didn't want to link the post here as it feels a little too personal to be slapping on Reddit. Sorry!) \n\nAs expected, once the family heard our side of the story and put everything together, many of them changed their tune. Most of the family members who had been calling me an asshole ended up apologizing and siding with me and my fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy brother was livid. He called me about an hour after the post went up and demanded that I take it down because it \"made him look bad\". He said he was being unfairly attacked, and even blamed me for his girlfriend breaking up with him.\n\nMy brother has formally been banned from the entire wedding, and we've asked any family members who continue to side with him to RSVP that they will not be attending. Our parents aren't happy with the turnout, and my mother has decided she won't be attending my wedding because of how I'm \"alienating\" my brother during an important event. I don't mind; I've never been very close with her, and while it is a bit sad that she's choosing my hardheaded brother over my wedding, I still have my father's full support.\n\nMy brother's (now ex) girlfriend is still invited and got promoted to bridesmaid because of how helpful and supportive she's been to my fianc\u00e9. Hopefully this is the last issue we'll run into during wedding planning! \n\nI hope this update lives up to any expectations. I never expected I'd be in this situation, but I'm glad so many people on this sub got a kick out of it, and very grateful for the advice and support I received.",

        "text": "The title basically sums it up, I suppose. My husband and I have been married for three years now, I have a daughter (15F) and he has a son (24M). I am friendly with my stepson, but we aren't close. He has a biological mother who is a perfectly fine woman, I'm not here to take the role of his mom. \n\nMy late husband (my daughter's father) died when my daughter was 6, we both contributed to her college fund. My daughter's paternal grandparents have also contributed a large amount. Right now, the fund has about $180,000. My daughter is extremely bright, and I'm not just saying that because I'm her mom. I truly believe she has the capacity to go to an Ivy league school, and her teachers have said she has the potential as well, and I don't want costs to hold her back. Our income would be too high to get any meaningful financial aid, and while there are a few merit based scholarships out there that she will be applying too, we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket and hope she gets it when it's so competitive. My current husband and I have separate finances, he doesn't contribute at all to my daughter's fund.\n\nMy stepson is struggling with a heroin addiction, and has stolen money, jewelry, hierlooms, and electronics from us for drug money. I understand that addiction is a disease, and I personally paid for an outpatient detox for him, which cost $1000, which failed. His father then paid for an outpatient rehab program, which cost $6500, which also didn't work because he barely showed up. He promised us he'd do better next time and he needed another chance, so I split the cost of another $6500 outpatient rehab program with my husband, which seemed to work during program, but he relapsed as soon as he got out of it. I have spent so much money, time, and energy and it hasn't helped at all.\n\nMy husband and my stepson want to try a 60-day inpatient rehab program, which will cost $30,000. I had absolutely no idea where they were supposed to get the money for that, considering the thousands and thousands of dollars that were already spent, and the fact that we no longer had anything of value in our house. They want to use my daughter's college fund, which to me is absolutely off-limits. I feel like it's completely unfair to my daughter to punish her for my stepson's addiction, unfair to my late husband and his parents, but frankly, I don't think spending $30,000 will work. My husband thinks I'm an asshole because I'm prioritizing my daughter's education over his son's life, and he believes medical needs come first. \n\nHe then asked my daughter if she'd be willing to use $30,000 from her fund to pay for her stepbrother's rehab, and she got very quiet and did not answer. He then got very upset with her and said she was being selfish. My daughter later told me that she didn't want to give her stepbrother the money, but she felt so guilty, and I am furious at my husband for emotionally guiltripping my daughter like that.",

        "text": "My wife and her younger sister are best friends. As a result, when our middle daughter and her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. With sixteen years of hindsight, I can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. \n\nNothing happened in particular. My daughter just doesn't like her cousin. My wife keeps pushing the relationship. This includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. \n\nWe're pretty sure I'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. From my perspective, this isn't important, and I do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. I'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. \n\nThis is where I'm probably an asshole. Yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. My daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: \"Unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family\". The call occurred. This morning, we awoke to a PowerPoint presentation titled *Valid Reasons to Dislike \\[Cousin\\].* Using clips from the zoom call, segments included *Why is \\[Cousin's\\] Voice so Grating? A Music Theory Approach, A Case Study: Conversations That Provide No Value*, *Rethinking the Idea That There Are No Dumb Questions*, ect. With the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. \n\nMy wife was furious. My eldest daughter and I lost our shit laughing. My wife is demanding I support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. I have refused because I feel this is whole situation wouldn't have occurred if she didn't push the relationship, but I'm starting to have second thoughts because it was very mean. AITA?",

The TLDR is I have a friend, Kate, and I wanted her to be my best man. My fianc\u00e9e disapproved and we got into a fight about it.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I ended up making up and reconciling a few days later. We were talking compromises and it was still a touchy subject but I thought it was going good and we\u2019d recover. I wish I could leave it at that.\n\nShe\u2019s now my ex-fianc\u00e9e. A little over two weeks after our fight a friend of Jas contacted me. She told me Jasmin had been venting to her friends over the Kate situation and she couldn\u2019t keep quiet any longer because it wasn\u2019t fair to me. This friend sent me messages between Jasmin and them where Jasmin is essentially talking about not trusting me and Kate and saying some pretty derogatory things about her. If that was it I\u2019d be angry but not furious. Long story short, the conversation turns into some confusing conversation I didn\u2019t have much context for, but I got the gist. The friend that sent me the messages filled me in with what she knew. \n\nBasically Jas had an affair before we got engaged. It had allegedly been just one time with some guy she doesn\u2019t talk to anymore, but I don\u2019t know what to believe. Based on the messages it seems like that was the case. Apparently all of her friends knew about this and I was being played the whole time.\n\nI talked to Jas and she denied it but I told her I didn\u2019t care, she needed to leave. She was throwing a fit and refused to, so I left my own home again because of her. Told her I\u2019d tell everyone what she did if she didn\u2019t pack up her shit and go by the time I returned. It worked, two days later I came back and she was gone. She\u2019s tried contacting me to \u201cset things right\u201d but I\u2019m not interested. She can keep the ring for all I care at this point, I just don\u2019t want to see her yet.\n\nI felt so stupid and worthless and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t tell anyone the reason we broke it off. No idea what Jas is telling people, and I don\u2019t care. The past month and a half has been a nightmare, but I\u2019ve been slowly recovering my pride, and I\u2019m trying to convince myself what she did was her own fault, not mine. It works about half the time.\n\nAnd because I know some of you are going to ask because you think this is some shitty fucking romcom, I didn\u2019t go running to Kate. I\u2019ve hardly spoken to her or anyone else for a while now. I\u2019ve been enjoying quarantine and being left alone. \n\nThat\u2019s my final update on the situation, those of you who said Jas was being paranoid because she had something to hide can go pat yourselves on the back.",

For the last six months I\u2019ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I\u2019ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there\u2019s not someone renting full-time.\n\n My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she\u2019s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she\u2019s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it\u2019s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She\u2019s my older sister and I\u2019ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I\u2019m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?",

He insisted and even suggested I take the night off or swap shifts with another nurse but I couldn't do that last minute.\n\n\nI thought he dropped it then but when I went into the shower and got out I couldn't find him nor my car,  I freaked out and started calling for half an hour but he didn't answer me, I tried again til one of his friends picked up, I demanded he give the phone to my fiance but he said they were out and confirmed that he took my car and told me that my fiance said that it's better that I skip my shift and he'll be back with my car later. I couldn't take it I felt so enraged I had my fiance on the phone telling him I did not consent for him to take my car to go hang out with friends and said I'd call the police to get it back if he refused to come back with it, but he didn't take me seriously so I ended up calling the police and he and his friends were picked up at the bar where they were hanging out, then were taken to the police department.\n\nI got my car from there and still went to my shift, my fiance was let go hours after I left and he blew up my phone with missed calls and texts about how I was out of my mind to call the police on him and put him in this situation.

They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. \n\nI got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by \"pretending they're bad people\" and \"making up false homophobia accusations\". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",

        "text": "Back in March his parents decided they wanted to come \"wait quarantine out\" at our apartment. For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. \n\nOut of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said \"Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work\". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. \n\nI go into the guest room and say \"Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house.\" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, \"You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before.\" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. \n\nNow my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me. If Reddit determines I am the asshole, I will call and apologize.",

He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn\u2019t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn\u2019t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. \n\nI turned in my two weeks and he said \u201coh sweetie, you know you can\u2019t leave.\u201d I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you\u2019re here to stay.\u201d I got so furious and decided that was it. I said \u201cwell screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.\u201d Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. \n\nA former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I\u2019m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I\u2019m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I\u2019m curious, I thought I\u2019d ask here. AITA?",

        "text": "I bought a house a few months ago and moved in last month. The previous owner was a friendly old man that could no longer live alone so he decided to sell and move in with his daughter. Just to be clear I put disabled in quotation marks because the lady in question is just really really overweight and I am not sure if that counts as disabled.\n\nNow apparantly he had been allowing use of his driveway to his \"disabled\" neighbor lady largely because street parking is extremely limited and what little street parking there is, is pretty much instantly occupied. What I am saying is unless you have a driveway you end up having to park a good 5 minute walk away and that's the best case scenario.\n\nObviously I was unaware of this so I was surprised to see a large SUV parked in my driveway when I moved in. I ended up having to knock on several doors asking who's car it was because the movers could not stand still on the busy road too long. I figured out it was the neighbors car so after a good 10 minutes of knocking an extremely angry enormous lady opened the door. I told her to move the car and she immediatly started arguing that the neighbor said it was fine, I told her he moved out, I moved in and no it is not fine and to move it because the movers need to unload my stuff. She begrudgingly did, I ended up seeing her walking back  half an hour later completely wet with sweat.\n\nNow a few days later I went back to work and lo and behold, the SUV is parked in my driveway again. I go over there again, spend 20 minutes knocking on the door before this lady opens the door, agaon, visibly angry. I tell her to move her car, my driveway is not public parking. She protests saying her ankles can't take walking the distance and claims I can easily walk, I tell her that while that might be true, it's my goddamn driveway and I want to park there myself. Again she moves her car, again I spot her half an hour later drenched in sweat making her way home.\n\nWell it happened again a week ago and this time she would not open her door, I got tired of it and had her SUV towed. She of course came to my house to scream at me, I told her to get the hell of off my property. A few days later I had a small fence installed with a lock on it to make sure it did not happen again.\n\nI have since been getting dirty looks from her and one other neighbor and when I told my mom she told me I should be nicer to people. I do feel sort of bad too, she clearly struggles with the walk after all.",

Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I\u2019m working in my downstairs office. \n\nI hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. \nIE: \nGuy: So where do you live ? \nHer: North of here\nGuy: Yeah but where?\nHer: It\u2019s kind of a weird spot\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, \u201cWhat is this? The census? She\u2019s watching my kid. Let her be. \u201c I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. \n\nI get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. \n\nAm I the A-hole?\n\n\nUpdate: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won\u2019t be back. To quote her, \u201cThe thirsty ones never get the hint.\u201d\n\nThe most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, \u201cIf you think that was bad you should check out my DM\u2019s\u201d. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It\u2019s just street flashing with less effort. It\u2019s insane and it\u2019s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. \n\nMy wife is deflecting from whether I\u2019m still the a-hole but I\u2019ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It\u2019s a give and take like anything in this world. \n\nAnyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the \u201cthirsty\u201d ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media.",

        "text": "We can all agree 2020 was a shit year. Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left. \n \nI fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.\n\nHonestly it hasn\u2019t been easy. We\u2019re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.\n\nHis behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there\u2019s days where he\u2019s withdrawn.\n\nDays before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.\n\nMy girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.\n\nYesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. \n\nMy brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don\u2019t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he\u2019d think that and he told me what happened.\n\nThat day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I\u2019m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. \n\nI was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn\u2019t deny it. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I \u201cgave up my life\u201d to take care of him. \nAnd the thing about giving him up isn\u2019t that big of a deal to her because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll actually do it.\n\nI said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn\u2019t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.\n\nSince last night I\u2019ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. \n\nThey\u2019ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I\u2019m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: OK wow this has gotten a TON of feedback. Thanks everyone for your kind and encouraging words. I might not have replied to a lot of the comments that made me smile but just know that I read an appreciate them! \n\n\nI know I only posted this a few hours ago but I\u2019ve had a day to clear my head and really think about this. I talked to my brother because I wanted to know if she\u2019s said anything else to him. Thankfully she hasn\u2019t and we had another serious chat to remind him everything she told him is completely false. I would never in a million years give him up and that shouldn\u2019t have been put in his head. \n\nAnother thing I told him was that I\u2019m grateful he\u2019s here with me. Without him I wouldn\u2019t have made it through the year and I thanked him for giving me that strength to keep going. Someone who DM\u2019d me suggested reassuring him that he\u2019s not somehow \u201cruining\u201d my life incase he feels any guilt for what she told him. Thank you for that suggestion!\n\n\nNow, I know you were all waiting on this news. Yes, I did break up with her. Thinking about what a lot of you said, talking to my brother about how this made him feel, and my own thoughts about how badly she acted, I decided that\u2019s not someone I want around me or him. I can\u2019t risk her doing something like this again and ruining any progress he makes in therapy. \n\nI know many of you think I should\u2019ve done it on the spot, but I wanted to make this decision with a clear head and not when my emotions were extremely high. \n\nShe came by my place earlier and we talked outside. Her reaction was as bad as you\u2019d expect and she STILL believed she did nothing wrong, even after I explained it all to her. There was just no making her understand and I told her it was over. I gave her a couple of her things that were lying around my apartment and she left. \n\nMy phone started going off like an hour later so I had to put it on Do Not Disturb. That\u2019s all the drama I could handle for one night. I\u2019ll deal with my friends some other time. \nHonestly, I\u2019m exhausted. Mentally and emotionally drained right now. \n\nI think this weekend we\u2019ll do something  to get our minds off this. I definitely need it after everything and I know my brother does too. It\u2019s been a hard year already without all this extra drama. \nAnyways sorry for the really long update you guys but I didn\u2019t want to leave anyone hanging. \n\nI\u2019m sure more comments will keep coming. I probably won\u2019t be sleeping much tonight so I\u2019ll keep my mind busy by reading and replying to more of you. Thanks again for the support! What a shitty way to start the new year but here\u2019s hoping for better things :)",

        "text": "My older brother (30M) went to university and then worked in the city as an accountant, I (27M) stated to work for my dad as a plumber at 15 and went to college to get my qualifications in plumbing and gas, about the time covid started my brother moved back from the city and started working for my dad (55M) in accounting, my dad has been unwell for the last 4 years due to asbestosis it has been really hard on the family and he is getting worse but is still loving life. \n\nI have been running the business for the last 2 years we have expanded and now have 50 vans in the fleet and one qualified and one trainee allocated to each van, covid was hard in the beginning but we have bounced back, my dad still works on tools with me on Fridays (half day then back to my place for some beers), Friday is the only day I\u2019m on tools now as I\u2019m doing everything to run the business.\n\nwell last month he told the family he is stepping down from the business due to health and wants to spend more time with my mother, and is giving the business to my brother and for me to step down from acting CEO, this upset me iv been with the business for 12 years, at the beginning it was only me and my dad my brother never wanted to be in the business said it was not worth his time and now he\u2019s the boss, and iv been dumped back to a heating engineer with a \u00a320,000 pay cut, he doesn\u2019t have any clue what we do or how to do it. \n\nI spoke to my dad and he told me that my brother deserve it for all he has done, that he has a family and I don\u2019t and that he went to uni , a lot of the workers are upset about the decision and have told me they will go where I go. \n\nI told my dad that if that is how he feels then I will leave and start my own business I have not spoke to my dad or brother since and have told them to never contact me, for the last month Iv had thousands of calls and messages from family saying some very hurtful things and telling me I\u2019m ungrateful for what I have so AITA???\n\nEDIT I want to say thank you to everyone for your kind words there are so many to reply to I will do my best to thank you all, to hear my father tell me in his own way he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough was hard and for my family to take his and my brother side was even harder. \n\nIn the morning I will contact the large clients iv worked with over the last 6 years I know we had some site postponed due to covid (big money), and will try and take them over I have 20 of my colleagues wishing to come work for me iv saved nearly all of the money I have earned over the last 12 years so think I have enough to get myself on my feet.\n\nUpdate I want to inform everyone that I\u2019m not starting a business to destroy my brother, as much as I want to iv spent almost 13 year build it and I don\u2019t want to see anyone out of a job or for the business to die it\u2019s about 0500 in England you have all helped me so much. \n\nI will be going over to talk to my father about 0800 and take him out for breakfast and talk, I\u2019m not sure if I will get a proper answer from him but I love my family and want my future kids to know them. \n\nI will update after the events of later today.\n\nUpvoted 2: as I said in one of the comments I believe my family had found my post and they did.\n\nThis morning when I arrived at my parents house my mum opened the door and looked like she had been cry a lot my dad came over to talk to me and we went out for breakfast, he didn\u2019t say a word on the way there or when we arrived, when on the way back he asked if we could pull over and talk I can honestly say this was the first tile I saw my dad cry, I asked why he did this to me he said doesn\u2019t know I keeper pushing and he finally told me he owed it to my brother for not being about for him as much as me when we were growing up and there was times my brother needed him but we was working. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it after 12 years of hard work that was his reasoning I told me father I had spent half my life working to do everything for the business and how he throw me to the side just because he\u2019s son came back hurt more then I could explain, he told me he knows as they had been shown the post I put up, to my surprise he wasn\u2019t mad he seemed remorseful, he told me my mother has been in pieces after reading the comments about how bad she treated me and thinks I will never talk to them again, my dad told me after reading it all he released he should have split the business between us as it will need both of us to keep progressing and apologies to me for never telling me how proud he was of everything I had done and thought I know how proud he was, but my brother has full control my father has no say any more and my brother would never go 50/50, he told me he wants me to go back as my brother will need me I told him that\u2019s not my problem anymore after the demoted me and cut my pay I tried to make it work for 3 weeks but my brother wouldn\u2019t listen didn\u2019t believe I know what I was talking about telling me he knows how to fun a business, so I left why work my ass off there when I could do the same work and make more money for my self. \n\nMy dad broke down said that he had destroyed the family and should never had done what he did I don\u2019t understand why I took this long to release I was a valuable piece in the company.\n\nUpdate 3: as I said I have had a couple of zoom calls with some clients today and they have gone very well, I have been informed that they we all be sending be signed proposal letters for the up and coming work, lucky the site start dates don\u2019t clash that was one of the main things I was worried about, 3 of my colleagues have now left the business and have spoken to my dad informing him about why they left and that they will be coming to work with me under there own choice, to hear them tell me this meant a lot, they all have between 5 - 10 year more experience in the industry, at the moment I have all we need to start a new business with the 3 vans I own and tools I have built up over the years, I am looking forward to the new venture in my life and can\u2019t wait to share this with my children when I have them.\n\n\nThen I received a call from my father asking me to come over for dinner I was unsure at first but thought it was probably a step in the right direction, on arrival my whole family was there, I went in and the atmosphere dropped my mum wouldn\u2019t look at me and my brother just sat there acting as if I didn\u2019t exist, my dad came and asked me and my brother to come in to his office, he started to ask when I was going to return to the company as they need me in early Monday morning, I could not even believe what I was hearing I told them both I\u2019m not coming back and have started my own company, and what dose he mean we you gave the business to him (my brother), my brother stated to lose his temper telling me if I cared about to company why would I leave, I have some very choice words before telling him that I have always cared for the company and spent 12 years of my life working to make it successful, unlike him who swans in and takes all the glory and that i will not sit there and be treated like that, I told my brother to f**k off so I could talk to dad, I asked what was this morning all about telling me he\u2019s sorry but then expects me to going running back, he couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye so I left said goodbye to my cousin, nieces and nephews and walked out iv been riding for about 3 hours on and off coming back on here to talk to people. \n\nI just want to say thank you to everyone for the personal message, comments, rewards and all the kind words and encouragement I\u2019ll try and message everyone but I\u2019m exhausted and will most likely fall asleep.\n\n\nUpdate 4: sorry it\u2019s been a while iv had a lot going on in the last couple of weeks, I\u2019ll try and explain the most I can, so the new business is going very well we have a lot of work coming in and making good money, at the end on the year I will be looking at expanding so very happy with that.\n\nme and my fianc\u00e9 are very happy she is very busy planning the wedding of her dreams she wants me to wear a suit but tough lucky I\u2019ll be in my kilt, I couldn\u2019t be happier then I am right now waking up to her every day, she is there for me no matter what and has been my rock through everything.\n\nThen my family my father and brother still refuse to talk to me and have told me they will not be attending the wedding even though they haven\u2019t been invited, my mother has called my fianc\u00e9 but hasn\u2019t said much only to ask about wedding stuff and will not talk to me, my fianc\u00e9 family have been amazing my soon to be in-laws have been helping with the wedding and everything else and I am extremely thankful for everything they have done for us.\n\nMy other family have now backed off and apologised and want to make amends for everything that was said.\n\nMyself and my fianc\u00e9 are set to have are wedding in November, we sat down together and have decided to trying to have children after we are married, we are both excited to be parents.",

        "text": "So I have a younger brother (13) who is a child prodigy. I won\u2019t give too many details but he\u2019s well known in the academic circles of our country and attends an institute of higher education. Naturally people are impressed with his intelligence and he\u2019s quite popular and makes friends easily. Our parents dote on him and have never told him \u201cno\u201d. As a result he has become very arrogant, condescending and disrespectful to people he deems below him...that\u2019s just about everyone.  \n\nLately he\u2019s been openly talking about a girl he\u2019s crushing on and much to his dismay she\u2019s quite unimpressed with him. He often complains to my parents and I about his failed attempts to befriend her. \n\nI understand why she dislikes him. On one occasion he invited her over for a school project and I overheard their interaction. He was constantly talking over her, dismissing her ideas and even calling them stupid. 99% of the time he was talking about himself and his accomplishments, being in news articles, his future plans are etc. The poor girl obviously seemed uncomfortable. He quizzed her about her career aspirations and when she answered he proceeded to point out it\u2019s a bad career path. \n\nToday he was once again complaining about her and said that she\u2019s obviously intimidated by his superior intellect. He claimed that all girls only like \u201cstupid guys\u201d and that \u201cwomen are emotional\u201d.  Sadly my parents agreed and kept assuring him that this girl is obviously uncomfortable with the fact he\u2019s so accomplished and awesome.  \n\n\nAfter hearing this nonsense many times, I finally told him that his crush dislikes him because he behaves like an obnoxious, know-it-all asshole. \nI explained that he\u2019d probably have a chance if he showed some modesty instead of talking down on this girl so much. \n\nSo my parents obviously think I\u2019m an asshole for saying this. They said that it was horrible of me to say this to a 13 year old and that he\u2019s just a child. I told them that he needs to realise that his personality is becoming a problem and that his crush dislikes him because he\u2019s an AH, not because he\u2019s \u201ctoo smart\u201d. AITA?",

My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well.

Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.\n\nHis wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.\n\nI was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.\n\nMy father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.\n\nAITA?",

I handed two hundreds from my envelope to my cousin in front of everyone, which caused quite the scene. \n\nMy family is very religious and refuse to accept gay marriage as legitimate. They refuse to acknowledge his husband as a member of our family and tell him he is going to hell unless he changes his lifestyle. \n\nI defended my decision by saying, \u201cwe\u2019re not married yet, and they are. I think there\u2019s been a mistake\u201d. Conversations quickly devolved, resulting in both my cousin and I leaving shortly after. \n\nMy family insights it was not my money to give and my actions disrespected both my grandparents and my fianc\u00e9.

Anyways, I decided to take your advice, and here\u2019s an update on the situation, for anyone that\u2019s interested!\n\nSo after reading a ton of your comments, I decided to call Joy and invite her over to talk. Luckily, she said yes (by the way, before this, she didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want to be at my wedding, so she was still planning on becoming a guest), and I apologized for kicking her out with no warning, but I laid out my frustrations. She apologized for being really picky about the dress and realized that the attention wasn\u2019t going to be on her and it wasn\u2019t her day, so it wasn\u2019t really appropriate for her to get upset over fine details on a dress. She also revealed to me that this was going to be her first time being a bridesmaid (she doesn\u2019t usually wear dresses, she\u2019s more of a leggings and sweatshirt type of girl). I took some of your guys\u2019 advice again and asked Joy to show me a couple of dresses online she would be comfortable with (didn\u2019t matter what color, I just wanted to see her style), and she searched for about 10 minutes and couldn\u2019t find one that she \u201cloved\u201d. She kind of looked bummed and a little apologetic, so I came up with a plan. The official dress shopping day for the bridesmaids was the next day, and I invited Joy to go with us, to get a feel for the dresses, to see if she would be comfortable. She agreed.\n\nSo the next day, my girls and I met up at a dress place, tried on a couple of dresses, and Joy didn\u2019t really like them, even though my other bridesmaids did. Finally, we tried on the 4th dress, which was THE one. The girls fell in LOVE with it, and I looked at joy and she was staring at herself in the mirror, but she had a smile on her face! :) I came up to her and told her again I didn\u2019t mind if she wore a shawl or cover up for some moments, and she nodded and smiled again. Actually one of my bridesmaids (who didn\u2019t really know about the situation) came up to joy and told her how gorgeous she looked in the dress. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears because they all looked so beautiful.\n\nSo we found a dress that was matching and all the girls were happy with, and Joy is back in the bridal party. Hope that this was a happy ending that everyone enjoyed :) Now for me, I have to go to plan other parts of the wedding with my fianc\u00e9:)\n\nEdit: I couldn\u2019t find the actual dress, but I did find something very similar online.\n\nhttps://www.kleinfeldbridalparty.com/shop/dresses/viewitem-KL2160586?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn8nqwo-q5wIVWgOzAB3N9wO6EAkYASABEgJuE_D_Bw\n\nEdit 2: and thank you guys for all the rewards!! <3. I just wanted to say that a little bit of communication can go a long way. I will admit that I was very stressed when helping my bridesmaids with the dresses, but having a simple conversation saved my friendship and my bridal party! I\u2019m so happy :)",

She has two older kids too, who are 8 and 7 now. 6 kids is a lot, but it's a pretty big house. \n\nI'm the only grandchild on my mother's side, and the only granddaughter on either side. My grandparents typically gift me jewelry, and I got my mother's collection when she died. As a religious custom, we don't really do costume jewelry. All of my jewelry is real and not cheap. It sounds vulgar, but my entire jewelry collection is worth about 100k easily. \n\nI came home from seeing a friend and the oldest three had a PILE of my jewelry on the floor of their playroom. They had been jumping on it, smashing it and shooting at it with BB guns (yeah, my father allows that apparently). I screamed and got my father, who came with his wife and dismissed the entire thing.  \n\nThey destroyed multiple pieces, several of which were heirloom. My stepmother didn't really care. She pretended to yell at her brats. She later came home with a dollar store necklace that she \"made\" the kids get me and said that that should be enough and that I shouldn't have such \"idols\" or wear such \"sacrilegious crap\" (one of my necklaces is a star of david). \n\nI saw red at that. I got her to repeat it so I could record it. I emailed all of my grandparents, aunts and uncles detailing what happened, attaching the recording and pictures of the damage, and then I went to those brats' playroom and destroyed one of each of their favorite toys. \n\nMy grandparents are now suing my stepmother for $50,000 and half of my family now hates her. My father is furious and thinks that I should have kept it within the family and let him \"work it out\".",

Like not actual court room judges, just people who were involved in stuff locally. The prize was some scholarship money for college. \n\nOur classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.\n\nIt was annoying how the \"outside judge\"kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??\n\nIt was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.\n\nSo I went up and said \"Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.\"\n\nShe sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. \n\nThe girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.\n\nMy principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detention\n\nAITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?\n\nEdit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be.",

He seemed weird in our talk. (He's been weird a lot lately, but I have been excusing it.) He told me that he said to put him on as an insurance beneficiary partially as a joke but then when I \"went off\" on my tangent (including offering up that he'll never go on my house title either even though he never mentioned it) that he got offended and reacted poorly. He said he really did think I was going off about all that in retaliation for his \"no to marriage\" talks so he was left with a bitter taste. Which...I get. I can be more forceful than I realize and I am naturally passive aggressive. He said I didn't have to put him on anything but he needs me to understand that I am it for him. He wants to makes his life with me. Things seemed to be better after this.\n\nThat weekend he asked if I wanted to go on a hike. It was peak season for the leaves changing and there is this waterfall he suggested we go to. We get to the waterfall and he pulls an envelope out of his jacket with a tiny bow on it and says it's a present for me. I open it and it's a receipt from a jewelry store. I was confused but I see he had the date of purchase highlighted and circled with a heart - it was early August (before the talks we had where he said he never wanted to get married). I turn and there he is with a ring. I said yes.\n\nHe said he knew I would never believe that he had the ring before all this without the receipt. That his attitude and comments when I started asking about marriage was to fool me so I didn't get suspicious because this was the plan all along - he wanted an autumn proposal in a beautiful location since it's my favorite season.\n\nMoney he has been saving after moving in with me (since I charge him a much smaller amount than he was previously paying) went to the ring. He saved money for over a year because he knew when he moved in with me that he was going to eventually ask me to marry him.\n\nSo honestly this is the best case scenario! We talked after too. When we get married we will add each other as beneficiaries on our insurance policies. And we decided there's no need to put him on my title even after we get married.\n\nI really appreciate everyone's comments on that last post! I read all of them and most people were genuinely concerned and offered wonderful advice and support.",

The main incident in my original post wasn\u2019t recorded but all six colleagues wrote a statement confirming what Sarah had said and how inappropriate it was. I didn\u2019t realise but John had also asked others who work with us if they, at any point, heard Sarah attack my character or physical appearance in a cruel or improper manner and if they did, would they be willing to write a statement. Apparently, she has been saying quite a few outrageous things behind my back and it seems that a lot of the hurtful office gossip about me did originate from her. I submitted a few examples of messages and emails, sent by Sarah during work hours, taking jokes about my appearance too far. I also included the messages where I asked her to stop causing attention at work as I\u2019m extremely uncomfortable with others regarding me in that way. Her claims of my bullying her and calling her flat chested and ugly at work were dismissed as she couldn\u2019t specify dates or find anyone to corroborate her story or even provide any examples of me ever being hostile or unprofessional. The phone call we had after the video team meeting where she claims I used threatening language against her was also disregarded as no recording was made and it was her word against mine; Luckily, I don\u2019t think they believed her on this point as I\u2019ve never displayed anything near the type of agressive behaviour she was accusing me of and my character references had me down as the quiet sort who gets on with work. \nWhile things were being reviewed, Sarah decided to quit. She\u2019s still adamant that I bullied and threatened her and felt no choice but to leave the toxic environment I created. I\u2019ve been reassured that there was no wrongdoing on my part except that I should\u2019ve reported things much sooner when inappropriate comments first started. From what I gather, Sarah\u2019s general behaviour at work has raised concerns for a while and I wasn\u2019t the first to complain about her. \n\nSome people were confused as to why I had considered her a friend in the beginning. When I joined the team 3 years ago, it was my first job out of uni and I was incredibly nervous but Sarah was the first to ask me questions and offer to hang out. She was a bit overbearing and rambunctious but I appreciated her efforts to get to know me and coax me out of my shell. We often did have a good laugh despite her sometimes making a joke at my expense but I tried not to take it to heart and occasionally reminded her to wind it in and be more considerate of my feelings. It\u2019s only been during the past 8 or so months where she\u2019s become especially rude and callous. I still referred to her as a friend of sorts but I never thought she would take things as far as she did.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for the kind words, advice and encouragement, it\u2019s really blown me away. I stepped away to talk to John for a while and let him know what a great guy a lot of people think he is. His little smile was adorable.\n\nDespite the misery at work I had to go through for a while, everything has turned out pretty amazing. I do love my job now that I can actually get on with it without the office drama. Finding out how my other coworkers feel about me has been incredibly reassuring and we\u2019ve now set up a weekly virtual pub night. My outlook has improved massively and I\u2019m taking steps to manage my anxieties and put aside past negativity.",

        "text": "I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  \n\nHowever, despite being a \"supporter,\" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, \"You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!\" or \"You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha.\" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was \"struggling with my weight\" and then proceed to tell me that I look \"way too skinny to be healthy.\" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to \"look like a man's.\" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.\n\nThese hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. \n\nFinally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, \"Maybe he's into curvier girls.\" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. \n\nShe called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",

        "text": "This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.\n\nHere we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he \"looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair\". I texted back, \"I'll take it for $4,000\" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.\n\nHere's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, \"well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask.\" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to \"sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam.\" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: \n\nWell this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:\n\nThe guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.\n\nThe dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.\n\nI would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would \"do bad things\" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.\n\nAnd to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",

        "text": "35F and my SIL is 46F. I have 3 children, the oldest being 16M. For my birthday last week my son went out and bought me this swinging hammock chair that I had been wanting for 2 years and it cost him quite a bit of his saved money (which I fully intend to put back in to his bank account so he can continue saving). He was so excited to see me open this gift and couldnt wait to help me set it up. I told him he shouldnt have, that it was a lot of money and his response was \"You never get anything nice. I wanted you to have it.\" And it was true. I usually dont get anything for my birthday or Christmases outside of Tupperware or soaps. So it might sound stupid but I have cherished this swing ever since he got it for me, especially where I finally have something nice that's mine. \n\nMy SIL comes over once a week to see all of us and she immediately headed straight for my swing (which my son hooked up on our deck). I told her to please not sit on it and she said \"Is there a weight limit?\" So I told her yes, 250lbs and I even showed her the box to confirm. She was not upset about this. She just said \"That's a bummer, they need to make something capable of holding us big girls\". I simply agreed with her and went about my business. At this point my husband shows up from work.\n\nWhen I went inside to grab us some drinks her and my husband are talking on the porch and not even 5 minutes later I hear a loud crash and my husband say \"Fuck, are you alright?\" I go out and sure enough she had sat in my swing and the crochet netting around the hook snapped on one side, causing her to fall right on her ass. She is sitting there laughing, gets up and says \"I guess i need to learn to listen.\" So I lost it. As I said above, I literally never get anything nice. Never. This is the one thing that I had that was mine and it didnt even take someone a freaking week before they ruined it for me. So I said \"I literally just fucking told you not even 20 minutes ago that it would not hold you and to please not fucking sit in it.\" She makes some comment about \"Usually the weight limit is a lie. I thought it would hold.\" So I said \"The weight limit probably would have held if you were only 50lbs heavier than it, not 150.\" (She is 420ish lbs because she is one of those girls who eat food on camera for money and she absolutely loves her weight). But regardless, instead of apologizing or offering to compensate me for my destroyed item, she has resorted to saying I'm a shit bag for making her feel like her weight is a problem and my husband is on her side. \"Its just a fucking swing\".

        "text": "Hey everyone. I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:\n\n* Dairy\n\n* Wheat/Flour/Gluten\n\n* Legumes\n\nSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. \n\nI never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.\n\nI noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.\n\nIt didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.\n\nI was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. \n\nShe has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got \"carb addicted.\" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?",

I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys get him anything that says  \u201cpapa\u201d? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?\u201d\n\nMIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just \u201cso excited\u201d about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.\n\nI was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole \u201cAre you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn\u2019t healthy\u201d faux concern thing that\u2019s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.\n\nThe other one was angry and saying that \u201cis being a mom somehow beneath you\u201d and \u201cdo you think you\u2019re better than the rest of us?\u201d and all that.\n\nWhen we finally left, he asked me why I\u2019d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven\u2019t. No one listened to me before. I\u2019ve said these things plenty of times. I\u2019ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I\u2019d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.\n\nI said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. \n\nWe\u2019re at a stalemate.

I knew he wanted me to watch my nephew, I called him several times on the phone and he did not pick up. I was so mad and almost freaking out because I was getting late for my shift. I sent him a text telling him to come pick his son up right now or I'd call cops on him for child abandonment. He texted back begging that I suck it up just this time because he had an important date and he couldn't leave in the middle of it. I told him that I was serious and I'd do it and gave him 10 minutes to get home.\n\n\nHe got home looking pissed and started yelling at me for ruining his date and making him leave in the middle of it, just because I couldn't bother skip one damn shift to watch my nephew. I told him I never agreed to watch his son and he made me do it. He said that it was an emergency which made me laugh because calling a date night \"emergency\" is just absurd. Long story short he left with my nephew but hasn't stopped blaming me for spoiling his date and probably causing damage to the relationship between him and his \"potential\" girlfriend.\n\nIt's been a week and he's still salty about it demanding I make it to him and call his date and lie to her and tell her some sob story about why he had to leave like that but I said I won't do that.\n\nAITA?",

Now that I'm a legal adult i got my named changed to Chrystal so now i don't have to deal with this fuckign bullshit for the rest of my life. Having this bullshit spelling and having to correct everyone everyday was annoying as hell and everyone before they met me would always think I'm some spoiled brat bitch when that isn't true at all. Your name affects how people see you, much of it is subconscious, and having these bullshit spellings is not good. \n\nMy mom lost her shit and started crying and threatened to cut me off for doing this. She said i betrayed her and our family by doing this. Im pretty sure I'm in the right but i need a sanity check here. I told my mom to go fuck herself and fuck her for causing me all these problems in my life and not supporting me and taking my complaints into considerations over my own fuckign name.

        "text": "For the last year I\u2019ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. \n\n\nAbout a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi guys\n\nI thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. \n\nI thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn\u2019t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201cI mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201d\n\n\nI made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201cgift card\u201d on the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like \u201calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201d But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not. I wouldn\u2019t be able to eggzagerate something like this.",

        "text": "So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she\u2019s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.\n\nSo anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n\nI\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. \n\nWhen the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off. \n\nA manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to my texts so now I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Some recent events have persuaded me to update you all on what\u2019s been going on. I\u2019ll just get right to it. \n\nMy wife and I are separated currently. I moved out so she and the kids could stay in our home. I\u2019m staying with my parents for now. I don\u2019t get to see my kids as often as I would like to. When I have a more stable living situation we\u2019ll have joint custody of them. It\u2019s been very hard on me and the kids. I talk to them on the phone every night, and they both keep asking when I\u2019m coming home. It breaks my heart that I can\u2019t answer that question.  My daughter is taking it the worst. I feel awful that her world had been turned upside down by her own parents. I miss my family. I miss seeing my kids everyday. \n\nI miss my wife. \n\nOur relationship has been put in limbo for now. She says she needs space to process, and doesn\u2019t know if she will be able to forgive me. I\u2019ve apologized in every way that I know how to. At this point I just have to give her the space she wants and hope she calms down. It would be horrible for us to throw away we built. If separating has been this hard in the kids, divorce is going to shatter them. She seems open to seeking couples counseling. It gives me some hope we can work past this.\n\nAs for reddit, I admit I didn\u2019t want to hold myself accountable before. I couldn\u2019t see how my actions were subconsciously harmful to my son. It was never my intention to be racist but I did treat my son differently due to his skin color when you strip it down to its roots. I realized how bad I fucked up when I felt ashamed thinking my wife has probably told her family why we separated. They used to think really highly of me. Now they all probably think I\u2019m a racist. I have no one to blame for that but myself.\n\nWith all the craziness going on in the world I know that I need to be more aware of my actions. My kids deserve to have their family to be safe haven from racism. It scares me thinking about the type of world I will send them out into where they could be racially profiled in most places. I can\u2019t imagine if it were my son on the news instead of one of those other poor guys. I\u2019ll never let anything get in the way of my relationship with him again. Thanks all.",

He prides himself on his BBQ skills. The thing is... I always end up doing everything! He buys and preps the meat and then grills and serves it (and collects praise for his BBQ skills). I have to buy drinks, get out enough dishes, clean up the patio/deck (non native speaker, idk which one to use). I prepare the sides and veggies, I refill the drinks and take away dishes (we don\u2019t use paper plates or plastic cups since I find it wasteful) so as to keep the main table tidy. It\u2019s just nonstop work for me. \n\n\nHe just told me last week that he invited his friends for Saturday (so yesterday). Just announced it, didn\u2019t ask me. I said well okay, do I know anyone? Nope, those are his work mates and they won\u2019t be bringing their spouses. My husband called it a \u201cguys\u2019 night\u201d. I said okay then, guys\u2019 night, well enjoy yourselves, I will be in my craft room working on some of my projects and drinking wine. He said he will handle it.\n\n\nSpoiler alert, he did not handle it. He got the meat alright, but just ignored any other preparation and I was just so sick and tired of being taken for granted (he never -asks- me for help, I just do stuff...) so I didn\u2019t do anything. The patio was a mess, the upholstery of the garden furniture was all messy from our dogs, the table wasn\u2019t wiped down, there was stuff lying all around. His friends arrived, I welcomed them and then excused myself to my crafts room, put some music on and worked. Cue the messages.\n\n\nHe started asking for stuff, like where are the plates (we only keep a small set in the kitchen, the rest is in the basement), where are the cups, why isn\u2019t the beer chilled, where is the non alcoholic beer - did I not buy it? Where are the sides? I just replied that he said he would handle it all himself.  (EDIT: this is also where I fee I might have been the asshole, it would have taken me just minutes to at least tell him where the stuff is)\n\n\nI checked on the guys a few hours later and it was a disaster. Table all cluttered, they ordered some takeout as sides, there weren\u2019t enough dishes and silverware, someone had to go drive for drinks. \n\n\nOn Sunday (today) he was all grumpy and actually told me that he is disappointed that I didn\u2019t pull my weight and that I made our family look sloppy and bad. I told him that I am not his little housewife and that he is a big guy and if he embarrassed himself in front of his work mates, that\u2019s all on him. And that I\u2019m glad that he can see at least a tiny bit of work that I do around the house. He got upset and went for a run to let off some steam. \n\n\nOh and the patio is full of dishes, he didn\u2019t even clean the grill. I\u2019m not touching anything.\n\nEdit/update: thank you for the comments, this made me realize I am at fault as well - for tolerating this for so long. I went out to clear my head (my husband came back from his run and is pointedly not speaking to me) and reconsider many things in our marriage.\n\nEdit/update2: maybe a similar story was posted before, apparently more husbands are assholes. Feel free to post the link to the supposedly identical post I copied this from, go ahead. \n\nAnd please don\u2019t give this awards, this is a throwaway account that I plan to abandon in a few days at most.",

But we live in a small town and everyone knows about everyone's business including rumors. So i kind of knew about this vaguely. A did come to see her as a courtesy once her illness became known to people in our place. \n\nShe was a very nice human being, a dutiful wife and daughter and i really miss her. She was also my best friend and confidante. She was a genuinely nice and kind person and she deteriorated quite quickly post her diagnosis. \n\nI just saw this account in her phone and am planning to have a chat with A to see if he would be willing to organise a scholarship (paid by me with her inheritance) in her memory to sponsor the higher education of few kids every year and making them self-sufficient. This is something she wanted to do. I am still not sure if i should tell A that i know their history. But thats a different discussion for a different day.\n\nI wish she had been one of those miraculous recoveries where doctors aren't even sure how something happened. She was a very warm and loving person and thanks to everyone who had messaged her asking for updates, checking on her. Thanks again.\n\nThe original post is here - https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hj96l8/aita_i_am_dying_and_want_to_have_a_catchup_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.\n\nThe next day, which was yesterday, she said she\u2019s found a way to name her baby \u2018Arya\u2019 and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. \n\nShe asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name. \n\nAITA?",

My boyfriend has been my rock through all this, I was a mess of tears and anger the first few days and he's the one who got me through it. Im currently staying with him (renting) but we have been looking for our own place together since the lease on the current place runs out soon. I went to my gp and got a mental health plan done up so I should be seeing a therapist soon, free of charge. Its not a huge update but Im doing a lot better in so little time from just cutting them out of my life, Im looking forward to the future.",

This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled. Now my husband is angry and says that it hurts his feelings that I am no longer sleeping next to him every night. AITA?",

And there is a resounding chorus of NTA! You don't owe anyone anything! Or someone was mean to OP, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. AITA?  No! They were rude so you get to be as well! \n\nI dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. Sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. These reactions are understandable. But just because its understandable doesn't mean OP can't be the asshole. \n\nBeing wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. People make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  It is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. \"They started it\" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. \n\nThis sub isn't \"was this person in the wrong to do this to me\" its \"am I the asshole.\"  ESH exists. NAH exists. \"NTA, but you should still apologize/try better next time\" exists. Let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.",

She is only feeding her one or two bottles of formula while I\u2019m at work. \n\nThe other morning she was cooking scrambled eggs and oatmeal and I was off work so I started to make our daughter a bottle and feed her and she stopped me and told me not to fill her up with that and she wanted her to eat her oatmeal first. I fed her the bottle anyway after a huge argument. \n\nWell baby had a doctors appointment and my wife was talking about the colic and screaming fits and when the doctor asked what she was feeding her she only said \u201cformula\u201d nothing else. I was angry because she lied and told her the pediatrician every single thing that she had been giving her and the doctor strongly recommended her to stop and that she was causing stomach upset and more than likely the reason for all her stomach issues. \n\nInstead of being apologetic for this, my wife is mad at me and told me I \u201cratted\u201d her out to the doctor and that she doesn\u2019t have to listen to her and that it\u2019s only a recommendation and that I made her look like a bad parent.

I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with \"My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem\" I then responded with \"I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers\" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said \"Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not\", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car \n\nLater when I got home I told my mom about it thinking she would see it as a funny story, boy was I wrong, she started going on about how I was so rude to that lady and that I need to learn to respect my elders\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.\n\nI pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn\u2019t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?\n\nEdit- okay I get it I\u2019m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn\u2019t think the triplets had different fathers. I\u2019m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",

Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the \u201ckids room\u201d which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They\u2019ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.\n\nThe other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I\u2019ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.\n\nH\u2019s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I\u2019ve been to their house before, it\u2019s horrible). \n\nAnyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G\u2019s shared one).\n\nI was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.\n\nCue a MASSIVE explosion.\n\nThe baby cannons are pissed that I don\u2019t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he\u2019s a \u201cgrowing boy\u201d and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to take care of kids\u201d.\n\nNone of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn\u2019t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.\n\nCue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can\u2019t stay. At this point, I\u2019m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSo I tell them I\u2019m leaving.\nCue more screaming.\nI drove up my father\u2019s boat, if I leave, there\u2019s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.\n\nI say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we\u2019re leaving.\n\nWell, baby cannons weren\u2019t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I\u2019m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. \n\nAITA here?\n\nUPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted.",

        "text": "I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. \n\nAbout 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to \u2018relieve\u2019 it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. \n\nI was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t. My ex\u2019s family treated me like their own, but my ex\u2019s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn\u2019t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. \n\nPeople thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn\u2019t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. \n\nFast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn\u2019t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. \n\nHowever, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn\u2019t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex\u2019s fault. He took a paternity test. \n\nThe poor baby girl was NEVER my ex\u2019s. The coworker apparently was dating this \u2018terrible\u2019 guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn\u2019t know who the child\u2019s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he\u2019d be the best father for her child. \n\nNow my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He\u2019s doing pretty bad now and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty like I should\u2019ve told him.\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. \n\nOkay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I\u2019m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I\u2019ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). \n\nI don\u2019t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn\u2019t after everything that happened between us. They\u2019re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should\u2019ve. \n\nEDIT: So here\u2019s what\u2019s been happening right now, I haven\u2019t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex\u2019s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing \u2018people who were never really family\u2019 over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn\u2019t biologically his, she\u2019s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex\u2018s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won\u2019t contribute to that but he says that he\u2019s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).",

One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.\n\nMy bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.\n\nI'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were \"a charity case\". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.\n\nAfter he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?\n\nquick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house. I did post a brief update and faq in my most recent comment.",

        "text": "I don't have a problem with the idea of parents who stay home with their kids. It's not like that. I get that childcare is expensive, and that often times it just makes sense.\n\nWhat I have a problem with is my teenage daughter literally planning her life to *only* become a SAHM. As in, no college, no jobs, no certifications, nothing at all to support herself until that time might come.\n\nI told her that it doesn't have to be college, that not everyone needs college. But that she needs to do *something* to start making money to put away so that, if anything goes wrong with her plan, she has a way to support herself and the potential kids.\n\nHer feedback was that her backup plan was me and my husband -- she would move in with us and go from there. We would help them survive. I told her then, what happens if we die, or we're incapacitated? She said \"I don't know, Mom, this is ridiculous, none of it is going to happen.\"\n\nI told her bluntly that I don't want her becoming Nancy Botwin 2.0, that if something happens, she *needs* to have a backup plan and something behind her other than relying on other people. I emphasized that again, it *does not need to be college*. She can start working retail to learn customer service skills that she can carry onto doing call center work from home if need be. She can start working as a receptionist somewhere, she can do any number of things. But she says no, she's going to plan to be a SAHM.\n\nWith that all in mind, I asked her, when she graduates high school, what is she going to do? She said \"Just try to find a husband. Maybe marry someone in the military.\" I asked her again, in between that time, how is she going to pay her bills? Her rent?\n\nShe said she assumed she would be living at home.\n\nI told her no, and that she would be moving out. She could live at home if she gets a job or tries to get some kind of community college degree or certification. But that if she insists on being a deadbeat loser and waiting for a man to come and rescue her, she's on her own.\n\nThis didn't go over well, and I am now being held up as totally unreasonable, mean, a huge bitch, etc.\n\nI don't think I'm wrong at all. I want to set her up for a lifetime of success and happiness. If this wonderful man who comes and whisks her away, knocks her up, etc, gets injured or dies, I don't want to have her come knocking at our door because she can't afford to take care of herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n**ETA:** Ohhhh my god, I posted this when I was SUPER agitated and walked away and forgot about it and came back to see all of the responses. Holy shit. Give me a few minutes to catch up. Damn.",

I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.\n\n\nShe stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. He said it causes him stress although I suggested he put on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.\n\nLast week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find her or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd...especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome, and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he admitted he faked the letter an hid her phone then argued that it's his house to and he has a say, but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless. I get that it's house too but I don't see why he's so against her staying.\n\n\nEdit:- he returned home and we started arguing again, I couldn't take it anymore I'm going to stay at a hotel for tonight am I'm leaving in an hour or so. He is wanting to talk again now but I'm incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out and need some time by myself. I don't care if he's going to change the locks or not I'm working on meeting up with my sister as soon as possible so we can talk more openly about what happened and hopefully try and figure something out.",

She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.\n\nThey started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.\n\nI had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for \"a few weeks\". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.\n\nIt's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.\n\nI'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.\n\nI'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.\n\nI said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I \"popped them out so close together\". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nYesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).",

        "text": "Throw away account although my sister in law will probably recognize the story anyway so I don\u2019t know why I even bother. I don\u2019t think what I did was an AH move at all but maybe the timing was a bit off but No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH full stop\n\n\nMy (f27) sister in law (f30) got married last weekend. She\u2019s my long term boyfriend\u2019s (m32) sister. They\u2019re white and I\u2019m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn\u2019t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who\u2019s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over \u20ac 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend. We talked a little and later they met and they started messaging directly to each other. \n\nThe wedding was amazing and everything went smoothly. I was one of the guests and she seemed happy. The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don\u2019t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she\u2019s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I\u2019m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she\u2019s in. \n\nI texted back are you kidding me?\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded with rage when I did it but even now I\u2019m calm I still don\u2019t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this. She\u2019s so beautiful and successful so please don\u2019t blame it on jealousy or scare of being outshined.\n\n#**edit for a little update**\n\n[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwwaaway22/comments/w220ia/update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n1) Sister in law is still on her honeymoon so I haven\u2019t talked to her yet but she\u2019s bombarding my bf demanding that I apologize and make a new insta story with my apology. More people got involved including my Bf\u2019s mother that thought I was way out of line ruining her daughters wedding. I have also got contacted by my sister in law\u2019s friends, some of them told me stories about what she\u2019s been talking about me behind my back. Yeah she got what she deserved. The amount of her friends that weren\u2019t surprised at all with her text made it clear for me that I wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\nMy sister in law is self employed with some foreign customers thats why she\u2019s taking it so hard because she\u2019s scared that would affect her career. I don\u2019t feel like I need to save her career should something bad happen to it.\n\n\n2) My photographer friend did what he was told. Thats the only right way imo. Being professional and not confuse work with his own values. He asked me if I wanted him to say something and I said no. I also asked him not to tell me what they\u2019re texting since she\u2019s his client so he shouldn\u2019t break confidentiality. He\u2019s just starting his career and he will meet worse brides. She was at least nice to him throughout their interaction.\n\n\n3) now to my bf. As I said he thought this whole thing was uncomfortable. I told him if he wanted to be with me he needed to discuss uncomfortable topics. He opened up and it was actually deeper than this. This has happened before. His uncle is very rich and for his 60th birthday he had a very big party. As a thank you we received thank you cards with our pictures on it professionally taken. I remember this picture because his uncle had a \u201cred carpet\u201d moment when guests were photographed upon their arrival. Later we went to my bf\u2019s mother to see the rest of the photos and I wasn\u2019t in any of them. I thought it was funny how I literally evaded being caught on camera. I never mentioned this or even reflected on it and while my bf and his family were looking at the pictures and discussing the evening it was just so normal and no one mentioned something out of the ordinary. Today he told me that I was photoshopped off the pictures. Everyone in his family knew it but me. At the time they just thought the uncle could choose whoever he wanted to have in his pictures and they moved on\n\n-but you all kept it from me \n\n-yes\n\n-so you must\u2019ve thought it was hurtful \n\n-i did, I asked my family not to tell you\n\n-and we continued going to that uncle. Celebrated some Christmases, Easters and vacations with him?\n\n\nSilence\n\n-you didn\u2019t feel offended on my behalf?\n\nSilence \n\n-and now you think it\u2019s okay that your sister is doing the same?\n\n-I didn\u2019t think of it that way I know my sister. She nit a racist.\n\n-if it wasn\u2019t racist why is she feeling \u201cembarrassed\u201d now? \n\nSilence \n\n\n-you think what she did was alright?\n\n\n-of course not!\n\n\n-will you just stand and watch when this happens to our children \n\n\n-OF COURSE NOT.\n\n\nI know my bf very well. He\u2019s very kind and I never felt he was racist in anyway. I know he\u2019s not stupid and is aware of these things which makes it worse because it just means he doesn\u2019t care enough. I asked him why he didn\u2019t care enough and he said he was so sorry but he knows me to be a strong girl that never let these petty things affect her. He\u2019s right, I normally ignore 99% of the racism and micro aggressions I face in life and even laugh at the ignorance. We even discussed this before. But does being strong mean that people are entitled to try to hurt me? Because I usually don\u2019t let them? Does it mean I wouldn\u2019t appreciate to feel the support of my bf having my back? Don\u2019t strong women deserve being supported by their loved ones and feeling safe and loved? He couldn\u2019t answer this.\n\nI told him that I never want his sister in my life again or his uncle and probably not his mother either if she still wants me to apologize. I don\u2019t want to surround myself with people like them and especially when I have children and I asked him if he\u2019s willing to live like that. I asked him not to answer me now and think about it. It kinda felt like an ultimatum and thats bad but I didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation better. \n\nI never thought of myself as someone who\u2019s petty or that makes ultimatums. This experience taught me that I\u2019m both\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\nAnd thank you for the NTA judgment <3",

But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.\n\n\nThey fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.",

        "text": "I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.\n\nA few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.\n\nMy future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.\n\nI told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.\n\nI definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?\n\n**EDIT**    \nI did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  \n**Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  \nYes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted. \n\n**Does your fiance have sisters?**  \nNo; he has two younger brothers.\n\n**Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  \nHe did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. \"Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet\".  It was very sweet and cute. \n\n**What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  \nBecause of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life. \n\n**Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  \nThat was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest. \n\n**Your sister is amazing!**  \nShe is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime. \n\n**Please update us**  \nI absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. ",

        "text": " My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\n\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\n\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\n\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There's really no chance.\"\n\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\n\nI said \"We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\n\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\n\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\n\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother.\" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\n\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\n\nI hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",

My neighbors (one street over but the back of their house faces the back of the house I live in) can see my whole backyard and vice versa. \n\nMy apartment has a whole wall of windows that are on the back of the house. It's gorgeous and is a big reason I picked the place, I love keeping plants and it let in a lot of light. Looking out, there is the neighbors backyard which is large and comes up close to my place, the property line is maybe 10 or 15 feet from my windows.\n\nOnce it has gotten to be warm out I've noticed the husband of the family who owns that house looking into my apartment a lot. Even sometimes I'll look up and see him, look away then look back minutes later and he's still looking. So I started shutting the shades during the day but that was kind of annoying, my place is a  dark cramped shoebox without the windows open. And I can't do that for too long because the plants were struggling without light\n\nSo I bought these window coverings that make windows into one way mirrors. During the day when it is light out, my windows look just like mirrors now.\n\nFrom the inside it looks pretty much the same, the windows look tinted slightly darker but that's it. From the outside you can't see in at all, it looks exactly like mirrors. The section of windows it's applied to is about 8 feet high and 20 feet wide. \n\nAfter a week of the window coverings being up, both of the parents from the neighbors house came to my door and wanted to talk to me. The wife was complaining about the windows for a lot of reasons... \n\n1. They were ugly\n\n2. It was uncomfortable, especially for the teens and their friends, to have a huge mirror adjacent to the swimming pool. It's at a time that they feel insecure about looks and they have lost interest in hanging out by the pool.\n3. In the afternoon and evening, it was reflecting a lot of extra sunlight into their backyard, they couldn't enjoy eating dinner on the back porch with the sun in their eyes.\n\nI said sorry about the inconvenience but I wanted it for privacy. \n\nThey both pushed back on that some and I said that I needed privacy because of the husband's starting.\n\nHe started denying it in front of his wife and so I took out my phone where I'd taken pictures and sent it to my group of friends, and showed her a couple pictires of him gaping at my apartment and the texts from that time.\n\nHe got mad and said he incidentally looked over, and the 8 foot by 20 foot mirror was a crazy overreaction.\n\nI said that I'd like to keep it, and that I was sorry but frankly this was avoidable. \n\nI think they're both mad because they called my landlord, who brushed them off \n\nAITA for putting the mirrored film on my windows?",

        "text": "Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:\n\n\\- I was wearing headphones all the time.\n\n\\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.\n\n\\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",

        "text": "My wife and I got married last summer. Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.\n\nThey invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.\n\nI honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).\n\nAfter arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.\n\nThis morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.\n\nMy wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Wow, I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the responses and awards! I took the advice of one of the posters here to ask my wife and her sisters to meet me for dinner apart from their parents. It was interesting to say the least.\n\nAfter we sat down, I leaned into them a bit about what had happened. I asked my wife if she knew her dad was going to demand we sleep separately, and she said she was surprised by it as well - she'd expect that if I were still just her boyfriend, but we're married now. I then asked them all if they thought it was OK for their parents to act the way they did. They said it wasn't, but they know their father and it's best to just let things like this go.\n\nThis led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me \"disrespecting him\" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.\n\nI then asked if they thought this was even about house rules, because it seemed more like their dad was just trying to show me who was in charge. They agreed.\n\nUp to this point I had really done everything I could to not escalate this situation, but I started to get really mad that they were all so afraid of how their dad would react. I decided I needed to push back a bit.\n\nI know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents. They know that their dad is probably going to freak out when they leave, but I think they realized this situation had gone too far so they decided they would come and deal with the fallout afterwards.\n\nSo that's where this all stands for now. I'm about to check out of my hotel and hit the road for San Diego. My wife and her sisters are coming down in a separate car after their parents leave for work. I fully expect their dad to throw a conniption fit when he finds out they left without telling him, but I really don't care at this point. I tried to be the bigger person at every turn, but he pushed this all way too far.\n\nThanks again to everyone for all the insight.",

        "text": "My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.\n\nI was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  \n\nSo we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.\n\nWhen we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.\n\nI told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.\n\nI told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on.",

He has a friend (Dean 14) that he started hanging out with a year ago. Dean is an amazing boy and has been nothing but a great influence for adam. I met Dean's dad (Mike) who's a single dad and we'd see each other daily for school pickup/drop offs. My husband kept asking about Mike and pointed out that he's being boundary stompping but I disagree.\n\nUnfortunately, Adam fell sick months ago and had to undergo a surgery recently. It's been hard but Dean kept visiting, sometimes Mike would come too and my husband would either ignore Mike or make passive comments towards him. Mike picked up on that and I told my husband to knock it off cause his hostility affected Adam and Dean as well.\n\n\nDays ago, I found Adam crying in his room, this was weeks after getting discharged, I asked and he said that Dean sent him a text telling him they were no longer friends and blocked his number. I was confused they were fine. I wanted to go talk to Dean but the next day I found his phone in my husband's car. I confronted him and he said he \"borrowed\" it from Dean but I didn't buy it. After pushing he confessed that he stole Dean's phone at the hospital and sent Adam a text telling him to not contact him again. I asked why and he said it was all Mike's fault for being too close to me and acting inappropriately, and said that he didn't want to directly tell Adam to no longer speak to Dean and chose this stratagy to not make Adam hate him while keeping Dean and by extention Mike away. This hit a nerve so hard I started screaming at him. He said he already expressed how uncomfertable he felt with Mike being around and I kept brushing it off. I said it was because of how ridiculous his argument was, Mike has been nothing but respectable and helpful, I yelled calling him insecure and unreasonable and also cruel for causing Adam heartache with his stunt. He begged I don't tell Adam but I took the phone and returned it to dean and exlained to him and Adam what happened.\n\n\nAdam is no longer speaking to my husband and he is blaming me for telling instead of keeping it between the adults like I'm supposed to.",

Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.\n\nWhat she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of \"he wouldn't be I interested anyway\" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.\n\n\nI'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his \"moody personality and introvert nature\" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.\n\n\n1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.\n\n2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.\n\n3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.\n\n4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind \"last minute\" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.",

They didn't fill it, but I made a spread on one of the pages that said 'go make new memories' with a picture of her and her fianc\u00e9. I put a lot of work into making it look cute.\n\nI called her and asked to talk. She arrived and we had a long discussion. I asked if she had any trauma, or self esteem issues (in a more tactful way, obviously) and she said no- she simply did not like having her photo taken and adopted the behaviour of screeching and kicking to avoid photos. She did say she had anxiety and that's why she had panic attacks, but that it was mostly because she was gassing herself up (if that makes sense). I knew she had anxiety, but not that she 'gassed herself up', if that makes sense? Btw, 'gassing herself up' are her words, not mine.\n\nRegarding her visit (the one that kicked things off) she explained that she was embarrassed by her behaviour and even more so when it was 'exposed' to her fianc\u00e9. She said she didn't quite realise how much time she had lost and that it was very emotional time for her. I apologised for my wording during our spat and we both made up.\n\nI even showed her the post and we read the comments together. We had quite a laugh at all the armchair psychologists and internet detectives that claimed just because she knew a sexual gesture as a child, she was in danger. Some people were writing borderline fanfiction and re-writing my entire history with my daughter based on one post- that's talent.\n\nAfter a little bit of talking, I brought out the album and gave it to her---\n\nShe was happy, and she seemed to take responsibility over the fact she refused to have pics taken. I told her I had printed out the candid ones from when she was 12-18 and asked if she wanted them. She said no. She really liked the page with her and her fianc\u00e9, which made me super happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's that! You might find this hard to believe, but other than this incident (which we are working through) we have a very good relationship.\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you for all your kind comments and rewards! I'm slowly working through all the comments and replying to as many as I can :)",

Since the day I found out we were having a girl he was hell bent on naming her Renesmae, absolutely refuses to compromise. He's a massive twilight fan, I personally hate it and would much rather that we don't name our baby after a fictional character. \n\nIt kinda hit boiling point last night, for weeks I've been telling him we are coming up with something else becaudr I'm not naming my child that. I went onto Instagram where he had posted a picture of us and said in the caption \"I can't wait to meet you Renesmae.\"\n\nI got really really mad my this. I told him to delete that, or change the caption because I'm not naming our daughter that. He refused, saying his friends knew now so we had to stick with it. I said \"I haven't fucking agreed to naming our daughter after some stupid made up character from the worst books ever fucking made. Delete the post now or get the fuck out of my house\". \n\nHe left to spend the night at a friends and my parents who heard the argument said I should just let him name our daughter that, saying it probably means a lot to him and that I'm being an unreasonable asshole. AITA?\n\nEdit: Feel the need to add, I have a stutter and can't even say Renesmae out loud, I would much rather name my child something I can say.\n\nStop trying to adopt my child. She is very much loved and wanted.",

        "text": "For context I\u2019m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don\u2019t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. \n\nI used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I\u2019ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don\u2019t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. \n\nFirst night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it\u2019s the little comments when I get into bed. Like \u201care we doing the slave tonight?\u201d Or \u201cshould I help you into bed grandma?\u201d Little things like that. I\u2019ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn\u2019t like it and my hope was that he\u2019d get used to it by now. \n\nLast night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn\u2019t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he\u2019d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn\u2019t tell me where. He wouldn\u2019t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. \n\nHe got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven\u2019t talked much about it but there\u2019s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our \u201crace issues\u201d and that I made him feel really racist and I didn\u2019t think about it that way. \n\nI thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn\u2019t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he\u2019s suggesting couples counseling to get through our \u201crace issues\u201d? I don\u2019t think it was that serious and I don\u2019t want to go through all that. AITA?",

        "text": "Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a \"puppy package\" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:\n\nVT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...\n\nMe: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.\n\nVT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.\n\nMe: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\n\n\\*silence\\*\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...\n\nVT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.\n\nMe: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.\n\nVT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.\n\nMe: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.\n\nVT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.\n\nMe: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?\n\nVT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.\n\nMe: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.\n\nVT: I'll be right back.\n\n...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:\n\n1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.\n2. It amazes me how many of you post things like \"you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this\"... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.\n3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).\n4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.\n5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.\n\nTo maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks?

        "text": "First/only post, I mainly lurk. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.\n\nI have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of \"just trying to help\", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. \n\nI'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)\n\nKat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to \"let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding\". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.\n\nLiterally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment \"tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering\". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my \"duty\" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was \"blindsided\" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?",

The rest of the week he is home with me. They dont do virtual learning during the rest of the week. No zoom calls are made. No teacher actually checks in. Homework at home is not to be sent back to the school and instead they get a participation grade the following week if they tell their teacher they completed it. Its backwards and your students arent being graded for the work they actually do.\n\nEvery monday we get a new flier in the mail asking for donations. Last week we got a flier that said to send out 20 emails to individuals to ask them for donations, with the promise of prizes for participation. They also had other prizes on this flier. Basically, the more people who donate using your name, the bigger the prize you get. \n\nMy son wanted the headphones prize. No where on the flier did it say how many donations was needed. I called the school to ask and they said 12. I sent out the 20 emails. 14 people donated. The donation list was to be emailed to the school with the student ID and we were to pick up the prizes this past Monday. Son was losing his mind excited because he got the 12 donations needed for the headphones. \n\nWe walk in and they proceed to tell me and my son that he did not qualify for the prize because in order to be eligible, you needed to get those 20 donations. Apparently the prizes for donations started counting AFTER you recieved the 20. They turned damn near every student away, not just my kid.\n\nSo I sent the boy out with his father and pulled the teacher and principle aside to let them know that I thought it was fucked up that they got these kids hopes up for absolutely nothing and that all they accomplished was destroying the children's spirits by lying to their faces. I then told them that I was told by the secretary that he only needed 12 donations for those headphones. \n\nThey said \"Sorry you feel that way. This is just how things are right now due to Covid.\" So I responded with \"Oh. So lying to students and breaking their spirits is okay because of Covid? Failing to provide virtual learning for the rest of the week like other schools is okay because of Covid? Asking for donations when the kids are only here once a week must be okay too right?\" I then walked out. \n\nWell, my son got the headphones in the mail today with a note from the superintendent that said \"I'm very sorry for the actions of the school system and the confusion formed around the donation drive. We are trying to work with the families, not turn them away. Please accept this as an apology.\" \n\nMy son is over the moon. My husband says that I was being a Karen and that we should have just dropped it because it teaches our son that life isnt fair and that I now look like an AH helicopter parent.\n\nAITA?

Most days are fine but other days are a living hell.\n\nYesterday I was assigned a table that had a husband, wife and what appeared to be a teenage daughter (maybe 17). Everything was going smooth at first and the wife ordered a margarita. The husband then tried ordering a beer. The wife instantly lost her noodles and said \"Uh, no. He will not have a beer. He will have a water.\" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive. It was childish.\n\nAnyways, he keeps telling me he wants a beer. She keeps telling me no. In this industry, situations like this are a lose/lose for waitresses. If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said \"Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here.\" They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.\n\nFlash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. \n\nWife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said \"She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night.\" She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it wasnt MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.\n\nGiven the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?",

His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.\n\nI was pissed and \"quit\" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.\n\nNow this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. \n\nMy dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.\n\nI declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.\n\nThe family restaurant however, is going under.  \n\nNow there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.\n\nThere was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.\n\nThe whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a \"super duper cool girl\".\n\nAnyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)\n\nThe final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.\n\nthe SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.\n\nMy daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying \"why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??\". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.\n\nMy daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:\n\nD \"hey its me\"\n\nSB \"thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha\"\n\nD \"what\"\n\nSB: \"arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts\"\n\nSB \"slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool\"\n\nD \"u dont like the party..?\"\n\nSB \"I jus wish i could go home looool\"\n\n\\~end\n\nIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).\n\nI took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said \"because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go.\" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.\n\nI talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said \"its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.\"\n\nI thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.\n\nMy wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?",

        "text": "So here's the problem, My son Simon (16) moved out of the room he used to share with his little brother and got his own room a few months back. Eversince, he's been complaining about his mom barging in without knocking and interrupting his sleep and studying. Sometimes when he's changing...I know that she's his mother but he says he's got his own room and has a job and is learning to become an independent adult but\ndoesn't feel like his privacy is being respected even when that's his mom. He says he's not a kid anymore and is entitled to at least get a knock on the door before she comes in.\n\nHe was getting tired of her not listening to him \nSo he came to me and said ...dad, you need to help me set some clear boundaries with mom. So I spoke to her about her need to knock before entering Simon's room. She was like what? And no, we're family, not strangers...do you really expect me to foolishly knock on the door 5 times a day?...that's ridiculous!!! Also the...\"who knocks doors in their own home?\". I told her my family for instance.\nShe made a face then went on a rant about how my family hate each others and the way they treat each others like they were strangers is shameful.\nI told her family or strangers it's about respecting one's privacy. We had an argument about it and\nI told her if she wasn't going to stop with the barging and refuse to knock on the door before entering then our son will get a lock.\n\nShe did it again at 11pm, she barged in when our son was asleep he jumped up because he got scared.\nOnce he told me this I told him to go ahead and get a lock and pay for it with his own money, there was literally no other way.\n\nMy wife saw it and got upset and my brother was visiting when she was raising her voice at me\nquestioning if *I* really went ahead and got a lock for Simon despite her disapproval and said that I caught her off guard and it's not okay because this teaches our children that they can 'manipulate' one parent into doing what they want. I told her that A. Simon got the lock not me and B. I already warned her about the possibility of him getting a lock because he was getting tired of her boundary crossing. So she should've expected this outcome.\n\nShe mentioned the same above points in her defense and said locks means secrets and that's not good. My brother was sitting watching while she was complaining, She began chewing him out when he asked her to let simon keep the lock and said it wasn't a big deal.\nShe stopped talking to me and Simon til we remove the lock but I've no intentions on doing that.\n\nWas I at fault for my stance?",

He's a great kid, but losing our parents made him a quiet, sad young boy. I've tried to encourage him to attend therapy so he can work on his grief, but he has refused every single time telling me that he's not ready yet. I get it, everyone works at their own peace and as longs as he's not deliberately hurting himself, I won't pressure him. I try to be as involve in his life as I can be without it being overwhelming, we both enjoy movie nights or binge watch shows on the weekends and he also helps my husband with his old car.\n\nBefore our parents passing my brother had a gf (16), she seemed like a good kid too, but after the funeral my brother decided that being in a relationship wasn't what he needed at that time and broke up with her. Totally valid. But she didn't take it good and was sure that my brother only needed ''some love'' to heal.\n\nLast month she began to drop letters and gifts to our door and my brother refused to open them every single time, she used to message and call him too and I could see the distress on my brother's face. The worst thing happened last friday, it was my brother's birthday and my husband and I decided to take him out, when we got back he went to his room and as soon as he did it, eh came down running.\n\nNow, his ex found her own way into my house, arranged his room with photos of him with her, their friends and our family, put some balloons and was waiting for him with a cake, mind you, this is creepy as fuck, so while my husband entertained her I called the police and they took her for trespassing private property. My brother is thankful, but my husband and the kid's parents are sure I'm overreacting and that I should drop the charges because she's trying to do something nice.\n\n**Little update: I just talked to my brother and we agreed on getting a restraining order no matter what, he'll be switching rooms since he told me that he can't sleep there anymore, our guest room is a bit smaller bus he says that he doesn't care! That's it for now, he hasn't said anything about therapy or dropping the charges.**",

Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?",

        "text": "I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.\n\nEdit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.\n\nVisibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.\n\nMy mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.\n\nThen a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.\n\nLast week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.\n\nIt's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her \"special little guy\" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.\n\nI feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I DO NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS TO BE TURNED INTO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE",

Everyone is expected to go, and it\u2019s frowned upon if you miss it. They wanted to go on a date. I said no, I have an important work event. They continued to nag me about how they haven\u2019t gone on a date for so long. \n\nThe night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city over had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they\u2019d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike\u2019s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again. Throughout the next two months, my brother and SIL regularly used the excuse of aiding Mike in his recovery and needing to visit him in order to make me babysit my nephew.\n\nMike\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s company and my company had a meeting two months after Mike\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d. I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike\u2019s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I \u201cgave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie\u201d. \n\nI made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I\u2019ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL\u2019s family. They even sent me proof of the relative\u2019s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn\u2019t care about betraying my trust, so I don\u2019t care if they can\u2019t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital. They said I was a bad aunt, needed to get over my grudge, and a petty asshole. AITA?",

        "text": "My (M33) parents are late for everything. Like everything. Both of my sister's and myself have been disappointed so many times.  \n\nGraduation ceremonies, birthday parties, even my father's retirement dinner.  It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  \n\nI have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  \n\nWe are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. \n\nMy now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quincea\u00f1era.  \n\nSo here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. \n\nWhen we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  \n\nMy mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  \n\nWhen she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  \n\nThe ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. \n\nThe problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  \n\nShe said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  \n\nMy idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  \n\nI came clean and told her about the \"special\" invitation.  \n\nShe is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  \n\nAITA,?\n\nEdit\n\nPart of the reason she is mad is because she had her invitation framed.  To be honest I was already planning a heist with my sisters to replace it with the real one in case she ever noticed the discrepancy between hers and the one we have framed in our home.\n\nEdit number two. \n\nYeah we are Latinos.  And no I do not in any way consider it racist how many of you guessed that.  I have been to Spain and it's an issue there too.  And the Philippines. Basically anywhere those guys were in charge.\n\nEdit three.  \n\nStop defending John. He and I have spent thirty years messing with each other.  I have an AITA story that ends with me getting an offensive tattoo ($5,000 for removal) and him getting a body cavity search at the Mexican border.  I would post it but it happened like ten years ago.",

And I call my other dad Dwayne, \"Pops\". \n\nMy birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages. \n\nSo dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy. \n\nPops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents.\n\nFor a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me \"My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner\" I said sure. I'll tell my family. \n\nSo yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says \"Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready\". She says \"You must be \\_\\_\\_\\_ dad so good to meet you\" and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen \"He's holding the mac n cheese tray\" with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says \"Who's he?\" i said, \"Oh that's my dad\". She said \"I though he's your dad\" she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says \"I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nI genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents \"let's leave\" and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said \"son don't worry this is nothing new haha\" and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep. \n\nSo AITA for not telling?",

These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport.\n\nI'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything.\n\nI woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower saying I ruined his entire day.\n\nWhen he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls.\n\nReally, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind.

        "text": "[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)\n\nSo, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \n\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn\u2019t I tell her earlier and she\u2019s so proud of me\n\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\n\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\n\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn\u2019t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \n\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\n\n> I\u2019m sorry for how I reacted; please don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It\u2019s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you\u2019re going to be where I wanted to be and I\u2019m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ranting I just need more time\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I\u2019m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don\u2019t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we\u2019re going to drift apart which would suck because we\u2019re best friends and I just don\u2019t want to lose my sister :(\n\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \n\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\n\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\n\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\n\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",

        "text": " \u25cfI M37 lost my wife of 10 years and it was so devastating for me and my daughter. It's unfortunate but life goes on no matter what happens\n\nMy family knows how much I struggle as a single dad and my sister doesn't really get it. She had issues with my late wife in the past but now started \"helping\" with my daughter. She re-decorated my daughter's room without my consent, she'd insist I let my daughter go spend days at her house but my daughter is comfortable at her home. She then started calling my daughter with another name and I'm still trying to understand her logic behind this. I told her to stop doing those things and to be respectful and supportive and she defended herself saying I'm lashing out of grief.\n\n\nI recently. started teaching my daughter to do stuff on her own like brush her hair/clean her room/wash her cups/make sandwiches while I take care of bigger stuff. My sister said that what I'm doing is wrong. That I'm giving her more than she can handle. She's just a kid and although I told her I'm teaching my daughter to be more independent she said that I'm clearly doing this for my own benefits and avoiding responsibility.\n\nI got into a fight with her about it. Told her she has zero say in this. And the next day. A CPS Officer came to my house and took a tour around the house\nMy first thought was \"maybe he got the wrong house\" until he started reading the report to me saying that I'm never home and that I make my daughter do things that aren't her responsibility, neglecting her education  (btw she's homeschooled) and that I'm not taking care of basic hygiene and whatnot. I told the officer my story and explained that I'm adapting as a single parent and he proceeded to aske my daughter some questions.\n\nIt was clearly a false report. However I was told that I will have a permanent record with CPS. and I was shaken up by this. I told my family about it and my younger sister told me that my sister was the one who called CPS after we had a big argument. I was so mad I confronted her after she hid herself. Called her immature and stupid to pull this crap (she's in her 40s) and that she's no longer my sister. Then cut contact. It's been months and now my dad started bringing her up knowing how uncomfortable I was. He said that my sister feels sorry for what she did and wanted to talk things out on Christmas dinner.But I said no. He and the others insisted saying that I should be the bigger person. the family will be incomplete without me and my daughter on Christmas. Saying I refuse to be a \"civil adult\" to solve the issue that is dividing the family. I yelled and said that my daughter and I don't have to go after what she did, doesn't matter if she has issues on her own and didn't \"mean it\" and was just concerned. wtf was she so concerned about? They demanded that I at least let my daughter go be with them >>and her auntie << on Christmas.\n\nEdit: I don't want my daughter to go and I plan on going to my in-laws instead. I want to talk to her about it and see what she wants to do.",

Because I know sh\\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.\n\nWell, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",

Should I have gone about it another way?\n\nEdit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.\n\nEdit 2: also whoever reported me as worried about my current mental health...thanks? I mean i'm honestly good but thanks.",

As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she\u2019d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn\u2019t often.\n\nShe\u2019s visiting right now. I don\u2019t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It\u2019s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He\u2019s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. \n\nNot long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she\u2019s given her opinion on it. Why don\u2019t I cut it? Don\u2019t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he\u2019s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn\u2019t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I\u2019m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he\u2019s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes \u201cgirl,\u201d that\u2019s on them and a simple \u201che\u2019s a boy\u201d corrects it. But mostly it\u2019s because I don\u2019t fucking want to. \n\nShe got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: \u201cWell I just don\u2019t like long hair on boys.\u201d Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that\u2019s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. \nI said the first thing which came to my head, which was: \u201cIf you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.\u201d\n\nBruh. If looks could kill, I\u2019d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn\u2019t say anything else. She hasn\u2019t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don\u2019t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won\u2019t bring it up anymore. \n\nI feel like we\u2019re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don\u2019t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.\n\nUpdate: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn\u2019t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I\u2019m glad I could make so many of you laugh. I\u2019m here all night. Seriously though, working until 7 am and gonna waste it all reading comments. See you all in the telestial kingdom.",

He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  \n\nSo the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). \nHis family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. \n\nWhen they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.\n\nSo long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  \n\nHe is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  \n\nHe has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  \n\nI don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  \n\nBut I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. \n\nI'm not giving it back. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to answer some common questions. \n\n1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. \n\n2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. \n\n3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. \n\n4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.\n\n5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.\n\nEdit n\u00famero dos.\n\nI just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her \"friend\" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.\n\nEdit tres\n\nMy half brother has posted about this. He has a slightly different viewpoint than myself.  He is not in any way coming after myself or my mother. If you comment there keep in mind he is a young man who is disillusioned with his father.",

        "text": "I sure feel like TA but I don't think I am so help me out here.\n\nI live in a non English speaking European country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.\n\nNow the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. \n\nThe field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. \n\nI also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.\n\nWell this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said \"Oh we figured it was a public pool\", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.\n\nThat was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.\n\nWell now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kids\n\nI honestly feel pretty terrible, but I also feel like I gave them plenty of warnings before taking drastic actions.",

        "text": "For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n\nI told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n\nIn all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. \n\nShe's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n\nHad another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n\nEDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. \n\nAlso, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n\nRegarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n\nAnd for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. \n\nRegarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n\nLast but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",

        "text": "\n\nMy boyfriend m/27 started asking to join me in my girls night in. Everytime I tried to say no he be like \"I have to join or you'll have to cancel\". It made me & the girls miserable having to sit there with him in the middle.\n\nThis past friday he insisted to join us again, I had enough I came up with an idea to get him to hate hanging out with us, made a plan and told the girls what we were going to do and they were down for ot.\n\n\nThe girls came and my boyfriend immediately sat with us and started ruining our conversations by steering them towards him/his work/his achievement. So here's what I did, I started bringing up gross/ embarrassing subjects and the girls were eating them up by talking about them in details. Subjects like sevx, periods (his most sensitive spot), cramp diarrhea, hairy legs, fart getting trapped in the valva and coming out the front. Squeezing shit out of our faces, cramp diarrhea, dirty underware, and again...cramp diarrhea.\n\nWe talked about this stuff in boring details, like...I could feel his discomfert without even looking at him. But God when I turned to see why he got quiet suddenly. he was getting red in the face, and had sweat all over his forehead, I bet he found himself unable to relate to thise subject thus couldn't take part in the conversation.\n\n\nHe got up from the couch ready to head out, I looked at him and asked where he was going and he was like \"I just ah...I just remembered that I have an important meeting with a guy in about 10 minutes and....ah...I have to go now\" he rushed out telling us to have fun. The girls and I started laughing hysterically.\n\n\nhe came home and berated me saying I made him feel uncomfortable/sick with the horrible subjects I kept bringing. I said \"what u talking about? This is the typical stuff girls talk about all the time\" but he insisted I made him upset and caused him to leave. He declined to speak to me and been quiet since then.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n**UPDATW** Y'all wow, just got home and left this post at 70ish comments, and here I am looking at hundreds of comments but only read a bunch, you guys...thank you so much for your feed back and enlightening advice. Just to add context: this is his apartment, he tells me who is and isn't allowed to come and I thought this was fine since it's his place (though I help with the bills, but he makes so much more as the head of security in his company so that's that) I just can't believe how dense and blind I been to his negative ways. He's still giving me the silent treatment and I've decided it's just a lot to take, and so I'm temporarily moving in with one of the girls and will now be definately reconsidering few things.\n\nJust wanted to keep you guys updated since many of you got engaged in this post, thank you so much for those DMing me their concerns, appreciate your time and concerns. Many hugs go out to you guys, I really appreciate y'all! :)",

During that week, my BF never reached out to me (even if to check if we arrived safely or to ask about our son) and that was the answer I needed. End of the week I texted him to ask if I could pick my things from his place.\nI told him things weren\u2019t working out as he clearly didn\u2019t care about me and we weren\u2019t a priority to him. He said he didn\u2019t see what he had done wrong which is why he had kept quiet and didn\u2019t reach out. \n\nHe said by me moving out, I was taking his son away from him; yet he spent 3/4 of his free time out of the house in the \u2018sauna\u2019(3-4hrs on a weekday after work and 8hrs on the weekend; EVERYDAY)\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t see the point of coming home to baby sit a 4 month old who needed his mother more. All I wanted was for him to come home after work on some days and take care of the baby while I shower in peace or eat food. \n\nHe said it\u2019s clear I wasn\u2019t ready to have a child because he knows women who work 9-5 jobs and still come home to cook and take care of the kids. Implying that I\u2019m failing because I need a break for an hour? \n\nHe said we could reverse roles and he wouldn\u2019t complain at all. When I told him he should be bonding with the baby, he said he\u2019ll take over when he\u2019s a toddler and easier to handle and that kids can be bribed with money and trips and they\u2019ll be your best friend. \n\nI did not make the decision to end this just because of this issue; it was a combination of all red flags. But to be honest, this was the last straw. I was running on fumes, exhausted physically and mentally and I was asking him to help me but he decided, without talking to me about it, that I didn\u2019t need a break. \n\nI believe He wants to live his life as a single man but enjoy the benefits of a relationship (sex, companionship, good housekeeping and food) when he comes home; that\u2019s not how a relationship works. \n\nFor a while he made me feel like what I was asking for was too much. And that I was crazy for asking for a little consideration. Like I wasn\u2019t worth fighting for. I felt it was wrong and talking to you guys here on reddit strengthened my resolve. \n\nWe are now officially ex\u2019s and to be honest, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a loss. I only feel stupid that I chose this person and I\u2019m tied to him for the rest of my life and now my child is the one that suffers from my choice and not having a good father around him everyday.\n\nThank you everyone for your encouraging comments and messages. You made me feel much better about everything and like I wasn\u2019t alone; y\u2019all are awesome! xoxoxo\n\nEdit; the comments were unlocked a while after the post was appoved. Sorry \ud83d\ude10 \n\nEdit; the awards \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d thank you so much",

        "text": "So I (17F) still live with my mom, my step-dad, and my two half siblings (5M and 7F). My dad died when I was 5, driving me to the hospital (Mom didn't want to pay for an ambulance). He died in the crash and my leg and spine got busted up in a way that has left me needing a cane pretty much ever since.\n\nMy step-dad's always been a little distant with me, he likes to make jokes about how I'm an 'early blooming black widow'. I think he gets that from my mom, who blames me for my dad's death. I do to, it *is* my fault after all, so I don't push back on it. Anyway, the point is that with the current situation my parents are always looking for ways to get my half siblings active and doing things without leaving the house, and have recently settled on scavenger hunts.\n\nI have no problem with this honestly. I wish they'd stop hiding stuff in my underwear drawer, but it's a 5 y0 and a 7 yo so that's not the worst. My *problem* though is that they keep taking my cane when I'm not looking (I tend to get lost in my homework and my writing hobby and zone out) and having it be one of the items that my half siblings have to find. When I complain to my step-dad (he's a SAHD so is usually the one running these things) he scolds me for being selfish and points out that my swivel chair has wheels if I need the bathroom and that they always get it to me before I have to go downstairs for dinner.\n\nI tried my mom yesterday, and she said that I was being a brat and that if I wanted a father who cared about me I shouldn't have killed my dad. I got really upset at that point and called my grandparents (my mom's parents, Dad's are dead too). They showed up at 10 PM yesterday, and Grandma screamed at them while Grandpa packed my stuff up and helped me out to their car.\n\nMy mom's been blowing up my phone and email, calling me all sorts of names and accusing me of turning her family against her and trying to get her in legal trouble since minors can't move out. And I can't help but think that maybe she's right so...AITA?\n\nEDIT: I would just like to say thank you to everyone who's taken the time to comment and try to reassure me that I'm not the asshole. I can't reply to all of you, I lack the energy and I have homework, but I'm reading them all and I really appreciate it! You've...given me a lot to think about, and I do thank you.\n\nEDIT 2: I Uhm...Wow. that's...that's a lot of support, and a lot of messages. Too many for me to reply to, I'm sorry. Thank you all so much. I promise that I do care what all of you have to say, and I'm reading every chat, comment, and PM. I was so scared this wasn't going to go my way, so thank you, thank all of you.",

        "text": "My friend is quirky. She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.\n\nI spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). \n\nOn her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. \n\nI was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. \n\nI got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. \n\nShe got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. \n\nMy friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this. \n\nAITA here?",

        "text": "My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0\n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0\n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a \"buddy.\" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.\n\nUPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!\n\nSecond, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.",

She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. \n\nWhile I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.\n\nI've seen his wife's social media, and she's posting about \"bastards wanting a payday\" and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn't have just used the legal system to get money that wasn't technically mine. AITA?",

I\u2019m actually subletting and I\u2019m on my 2nd year which is month-to-month, but we\u2019ve had an unofficial \u201cverbal\u201d agreement that I\u2019d stay until the end of the year. I mean it\u2019s a pandemic, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d move either. \n\nAnyways his gf moved in beginning of this year. It\u2019s been...a lot. She\u2019s obviously had some trauma in the past. I didn\u2019t dig but I believe she was the victim of a home robbery a few years back.\n\nWell when she first moved in my roommate had some \u201cground rules\u201d for me so his gf would be more comfortable. She obviously wasn\u2019t thrilled about having another roommate.\n\nHe said I couldn\u2019t talk to her (like strike up a convo) if he wasn\u2019t there because she doesn\u2019t want to have to talk to me if she didn\u2019t have to. He also said it would be best if we tried to not use the same facilities at the same time (like if she\u2019s cooking in the kitchen, I should wait until she leaves before I grab food, etc.) Like yes it\u2019s strange but I figured it\u2019s his place so whatever. I\u2019m not trying to befriend her either.\n\nThings got worse in recent months cause we\u2019ve all been working from home. It\u2019s REALLY hard to avoid someone 24/7. So obviously I\u2019ve slipped up more. One time I came home from Costco and offered her a spare bottle of coconut water I couldn\u2019t fit in the fridge. Big mistake. My roommate had to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me that night about how I should know she would never drink my drinks and it\u2019s weird for me to even offer. \n\nThe most recent one was when she was watching some GoT in our living room. I just absentmindedly watched a bit standing behind the couch. I laughed at a scene which startled her when she looked up and saw me standing behind her. I got another earful from my roommate about how I needed to stop \u201ccreeping\u201d on her now that I\u2019m home all the time. \n\nLong story short, my friend just had a place open up that\u2019s cheap and I\u2019m gonna move. I told my roommate and he\u2019s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he\u2019s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn\u2019t gonna move. But I\u2019m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. However, I feel kind of guilty because I agreed to their weird rules before all this started back when I thought it\u2019d be ok.",

I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. \n\nI attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my \"transformation\". \n\nThere was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my \"secret workout routine\" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of \"I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened\". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. \n\nI lost my patience and told her that \"I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine\". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.\n\nTurns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for \"embarrassing his sister on his wedding\".

In his room he has plenty of models and posters of motorcylces of all types. His bio dad passed away when he was just 12, now I'm married to my current husband and he has kids of his own.\n\n\nMy husband has always been against my son's interest in motorcycles. he thinks I'm encouraging him to be reckless, distracting him from school and by extension his future, and spoiling him and blowing away money by spending 7k on a motorcycle. This caused some tension between him and my son so I told him to stop complaining about it.\n\n\nAround 2 weeks ago, my son's motorcycle went missing. We opened a police report but nothing came out of it. it just disappeared. My husband had a smirk on his face the entire time just walking around saying \"I told you so!, you just wasted your money!\". This was unbbearablr to hear to be quite honest.\n\n\nMy mother inlaw visited few days ago. She was talking about the other house my husband owns and mentioned seeing a motorcycle, one that's similar to the one that we lost in my husband's carage while she was cleaning it (she goes to clean that house weekly even though it's empty, my husband plans on giving it to his kids as inheritance). I was puzzled I asked if she was certain but she showed me a photo she took of it which confirmed that it was indeed my son's motorcycle. I immedietly rushed to call my husband and confront him about it. He admitted that he took and hid the motorcycle in his garage as a last resort after me and his stepson kept brushing him and his thoughts off about the 7k being spent on something unnecesary and that could cause issues.\n\nI blew up at him demanding he return it, he refused and told me he had been considering selling it and giving the money back to me so \"I could use it wisely this time\". I told him I was serious and that I'd call the police. He literally said \"this is a family matter and cops can't do shit about it\". I had enough I called the cops soon as I ended the call with him.\n\n\nThe motorcycle was found and returned, but my husband had to be taken in since there was an open file about the motorcylce going missing. he was let go eventually but he was livid with me. He came home yelling about how awful what I did was and how crazy my behavior was. I refused to engage in the argument but he told his entire family about it and they judged me for calling the police on my own husband even though I already asked him to return it. he said he was just looking out for my son and that one day we'll realize that he was right but only when it's too late.\n\nMy son isn't spsaking to me or my husband. I feel horrible about the whole situation and am starting to think I handled this the wrong way.",

        "text": "My ex and I have one child together. We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. \n\nNot to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. \n\nHe ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't \"deal\" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. \n\nI have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce \"problems\" and that he couldn't handle raising a \"r******\" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. \n\nI was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action. I made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. I'm now getting calls and messages for \"making a private issue public\" and \"parental alienation\". AITA?",

Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that \"fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!\" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?",

        "text": "My (36) sister N (29) got pregnant at 18. I am infertile and knew I couldn't have kids so when N said she was giving her baby for adoption, I decided to be her mom. N went no contact 5 months after giving birth. For a bit of background, N got pregnant by a one night stand and she apparently didn't remember or know the father at the time of birth but when V was 2, a man T (35) messaged me on social media claiming to be the father of my child. N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life. I got too emotional and hung up. T came home from work and on explaining to him, he was beyond furious. I then got a call from my parents saying I was an asshole for telling N she couldn't she her baby. I said I never said that and I welcomed her to bond with V but they refused to listen and said I was being insensitive and harsh and flaunting my family.\n\nI now feel bad because me and N were very close as sisters and I feel quite close to her situation since I know the struggles of infertility. T said there was no way he was letting my sister have full time and I agree but I want to know if am the asshole for being too harsh and telling her about T.\n\nEdit - I did legally adopt V at birth. T adopted her too after we got married. N never wanted kids and I feel the only reason she wants V now is because her husband wants kids. I don't know but I think this is it and T agrees.\n\nEdit 2 - For all the people wandering why I said we were close, I  meant growing up.",

        "text": "I (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like \"I prefer pink over blue\" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm \"emotionally stronger\" than her. \n\nMy parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. \n\nI was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. \n\nMy sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has \"Euthyrox\" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. \n\nShe's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.\n\nI'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. \n\nMy parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic \"I should apologise since I'm more mature\". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. \n\nI ask them \"so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?\" \n\nNow they're mad at me too.",

Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.\n\nIn sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.\n\nMom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.\n\nBoy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.\n\nI broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.\n\nI said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.\n\neverything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.\n\nmoms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.\n\nDid I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.\n\nI've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.\n\n3000 char limit is an AH\n\n\nEDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.\n\nedit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.\n\n\nEDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.\n\n\nEDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all right\n\nedit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point.",

I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.\n\nMy mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.\n\nLong story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.\n\nWas I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).\n\nedit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?\n\nThere's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.\n\nLike one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.\n\nThis is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. \n\nMuch of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not \"trying harder\" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: no, I am not seeking relationship advice or validation on it. I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. \n\nI (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It\u2019s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it\u2019s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We\u2019ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It\u2019s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn\u2019t impact how I see him. \n\nMark is single after a breakup right now and I\u2019ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah\u2019s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was \u201cmaking eyes\u201d at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We\u2019re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.\n\nI have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark\u2019s house too and I won\u2019t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn\u2019t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn\u2019t feel like a joke. I told her \u201cif you seriously can\u2019t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you\u2019re not welcome here anymore. You\u2019re 30, act like it. Get out.\u201d\n\nHannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I\u2019m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.\n\nUpdate: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.\n\nUpdate 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.\n\nFinal update: love who you love! Gay, straight, bi, pan, whatever, who cares? Love whoever you wanna love and enjoy your lives!!",

And let me say my GF now understands why I wanted to wait until Sparky had died before getting a dog.\n\nWithin the six hours that we had the dog, Sparky had tried to bite him on the leg, I pulled him away before he could even make contact with him and hauled Sparky's ass upstairs away from the dog after that moment. While Upstairs Sparky did nothing but yowl at us and revenge pee on the bed, before hiding on top of the wardrobe. While all this was happening my friend's dog just lay there on the floor of the lounge doing absolutely nothing.\n\nUpon seeing what Sparky was willing to do to a dog that wouldn't even hurt a fly, my GF has now agreed that if she wants a dog then it has to be an outdoor dog (which she does not want) or to wait until the awful day that Sparky is no longer with us. Grumpus is very happy with that plan.\n\nGrumpus (Sparky) is now going to spend his golden years lying in front of the fire, watching tennis and Blue Planet on tv, eating lots of treats and sitting on the landing windowsill, where he loves to watch the whole world go by, while casually growling at any dog he sees walk past the house. And he very happy with this plan.\n\nI promise my friends dog was not hurt. I don't even think that he realised that my cat was planning on attacking him. And Sparky is as happy as a lamb again. No more revenge peeing.",

        "text": "My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). \n\nHe's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said \"I want to wear this.\" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. \n\nI figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. \n\nI drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. \n\nMy wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as \"the one who wore a dress\" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. \n\nAt the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it.

        "text": "My (24M) partner's (23F) close friend and boss (50'sM) at the mechanic shop needed a liver transplant. They had been on the list for a while and getting nowhere. Lots of us got tested and I was a match. We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.\n\nA week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.\n\nI immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery. We got on with our lives, partner found a new job and attended the court date where the case was thrown out 6 months later. \n\nA week after the case was dismissed, we got word boss had died. No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.\n\nI feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. \n\nBosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss. That I should have given the liver anyway and been a good person. \n\nI feel I should have given it, but who bites the hand that feeds? I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented. I'm conflicted and losing sleep over this. \n\nAITA for not giving my liver to the person accusing partner of theft and them later dying?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the positive and informative feedback. I think seeing the outside, impartial view on this has helped me put it in perspective. I've only been focusing on my selfishness causing his death, as opposed to his actions contributing too. I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.\n\nEdit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. \nClearing up a few things\n- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. \n- it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.\n- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us; they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.\n- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.\n- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated....",

I\u2019m out there watering the grass in the mornings and evenings. Every single time I\u2019ve done this the neighbor right next door who\u2019s like this older granny comes out to her porch and straight up watches me without even hiding it. I introduced myself to her once that me and my sister are the new owners after my dad passed but it was obvious she didn\u2019t wanna talk. \n\nNext thing she started coming outside with her *phone* pointing the camera right at me. I\u2019m like \u201c is there a problem?\u201d She says there\u2019s no problem as long as I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m supposed to. I asked her why is she recording me then. Neighbor lady goes what\u2019s the problem with me recording if you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. It\u2019s so fucking weird I didn\u2019t even know how to respond to the situation. \n\nSoon as I finished up to go back inside she went back to her house too. This happens every. single. day I\u2019m outside watering the grass. Always the same excuse that she wants to make sure I\u2019m not doing anything else or if I do it\u2019s on camera. So yesterday I got fed up and decided to do something different. When she came out with her phone I stuck my ass out and put my hand on my hip looking right at her. \n\nAt first she was like wtf but then she got really mad when I started wetting myself with the water hose an touching my neck while literally looking directly at her. Was it stupid? \n\nYes but she put her phone away and started cussing me out for being a pervert. My sister told me later on that she came to the house when I was at work talking about me sexually harassing her making poses in provocative ways. My sister knows she\u2019s a pain in the ass since she probably has nothing better to do with her time. \n\nBut I still shouldn\u2019t have stooped to her level making her uncomfortable right back. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m right on this one and it wasn\u2019t even that bad (not like i was grabbing my balls or anything) but also can be a dumbass sometimes so idk you guys tell me.

        "text": "My parents have always favored my younger brother. I was by no means unloved. But it was blatantly obvious who they cared about more. I worked a part time job to get my first car, but my brother got one as a present. It wasn't new, but was much newer than my car. It was the same with just about anything else, like clothes, video games and cell phones.\n\nI'm 18 and am taking a gap year before community college to work a full time job and save money for tuition. But a while back I heard my parents talking about how much they were going to pay for my brother's tuition. I secretly recorded the conversation from around the corner and then came out asking my parents why they were gonna pay for my brother's college, but not mine. They didn't notice my phone was recording and just said that my brother needs more help. I asked how so when I wasn't getting any sort of scholarship, and he likely wouldn't either. Then I asked a few more questions about why things have always been this way. They got mad and my father told me that perhaps it's time I moved out because they are sick of keeping a roof over my head. I pointed out I pay rent. But they didn't care.\n\nI left the room and in a fit of rage uploaded the video to two different social medias I have and ranted about how this is how my parents have always been. Well a few hours my parents were pounding at my door. My dad was screaming at me about how I made them look bad. We fought some more and they left the room fuming.\n\nMy grandparents contacted me later and said they were appalled, then came to visit with a lot of the family the next day. There was a huge family intervention and my parents were made to sit on the couch and look at their feet while being told off. It was then I found out they'd been receiving money for years from my grandparents to help with family expenses. My brother looked like he didn't know what to do. So he sided with the rest of the family and said he's noticed how I'm treated as well. My parents gave me a huge apology that sounded forced.\n\nMy grandparents have offered that I come live with them soon and will cut off the monthly payments to my parents, my father told me I should have never told the rest of the family and now won't talk to me, and my mother has been crying for days. So I'm starting to wonder if I went to far.\n\nSo AITA for exposing my parents favoritism?",

As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.\n\nI made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are \"boycotting\" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast. She apparently cried over it.\n\nEDIT: did not expect this post to blow up like that, thanks for the awards and the comments. ",

        "text": "I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. \n\n\n\nMy father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. \n\nMy mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. \n\nShe was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. \n\nMy mother was devastated and stopped eating properly.\n\n\n In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. \n\nAll this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. \n\nDuring her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. \n\nWhen he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) \n\nMy mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.\n\nI believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time.\n \n---------\n\nEdit : I want to make some facts clear -\n\n1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. \n\n\n2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit 2 :\n\n\n3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. \n\nIn fact, she didn't mention him at all. \n\n4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.\n\nWe have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.\n\nI plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support.",

I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for \u201cnot participating with the family dynamic\u201d and \u201cnever talking to him.\u201d I also don\u2019t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I\u2019ve been looking for a redirect for a while. \n\nI read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says \u201cthey faked the moon landing\u201d you say \u201chaha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?\u201d I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.\n\nMy Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, \u201coh, you\u2019ve heard that, well get this\u201d and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I\u2019ve been doing it even more, and I haven\u2019t had a political argument in a whole month. \n\nThis Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the \u201cdeath of Planned Parenthood.\u201d Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn\u2019t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, \u201coh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned\u201d and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it\u2019s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. \n\nI received a lecture about \u201cnot taking people\u2019s political views seriously\u201d from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, \u201cyou\u2019re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.\u201d",

This post has really blown up but anyway...**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Content warning: Transphobia\\*\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband is a transgender man and we've always wanted to start a family together. I have a huge fear of pregnancy so he offered to carry the baby. It was an insane process. He had to stop taking testosterone for a long time but he was amazing throughout the whole process and I did everything in my power to help him feel more comfortable.\n\nNone of my family know that he is transgender (homophobic, transphobic, all the phobics), but our friends know. He posted an ultrasound to his private instagram, not knowing that my sister follows him on a burner account. Well, she saw the photo and told my whole family. They were FURIOUS that I wouldn't tell them (our plan was to say we adopted). They assumed I was the one pregnant and blew up on me, so I just let it go and rolled with the lie because I wasn't going to out my husband.\n\nThe first couple of months I'd let them visit, eventually I'd start eating big meals and purposely bloating myself to the point of discomfort so I looked pregnant. They'd remark around the 6 month mark that I was remarkably small but I just played it off. Eventually I couldn't lie any longer, so I looked for every excuse in the book to not see my family. I turned down the offers of baby showers, gender reveal parties, anything that would require us seeing each other. Luckily my family live an hour away and we all live busy lifestyles, so them randomly visiting wasn't an issue. The one time they did pop in unexpectedly, we were out of the house. If they Facetimed, I made a point to be in bed feeling horribly sick so I couldn't give a \"bump update\". I lied my ass off and they just thought I had a rough pregnancy.\n\nMy husband gave birth a year ago and went straight back on the testosterone, and now we're happy as ever. My family have met our daughter and they adore her.\n\nA week ago, after an argument between myself and a friend, said friend decided to out my husband by messaging my family and included proof. They did it by adding everybody to a group chat, posting screenshots and basically the whole story, then saying \"I'll leave you all to discuss\", then they left the chat and blocked me and my husband.\n\nIn a transphobic rage, my mother raced to my home and all but beat my front door down. It wasn't pretty. I had to call the cops. I've been disowned, but that hasn't stopped the daily calls and texts coming from my parents, aunts, uncles, siblings etc., leaving nasty transphobic slurs on my voicemail and other hateful crap.\n\nI ended up crying to my friend yesterday who told me that I should have been honest with my family, as it would've saved me a lot of heart ache. That, or said we miscarried and then adopted later. I'm not happy that things played out the way they did. I just feel so sad now. Maybe it was wrong to lie to my family, but I feel like I had no choice.\n\n**Edit, because I figured I'd put this in the main text:**\n\nMy husband has always encouraged me to maintain a relationship with my family however it was mostly for his sake. Personally, I mentally checked out years ago. But when they met him, they welcomed him with open arms and treated him like a son. Yes, it was conditional on him being presumed cisgender, however we never intended for them to find out. He felt a familial love that he's never had from his own family before, which is why I kept my relationship with my parents at his request. If it weren't for him, I most likely would have cut them off a long time ago. I'm sad that this has happened, but most of that sadness is for my husband rather than for me.\n\nAlso the friend in this story who outed him is obviously no longer a friend, and never will be again. The other friend who said I should've told the truth is on thin ice.\n\n**Another edit: Y'all are making us ugly cry. Thank you so much for the support.**",

He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again.\n\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything.\n\n\nWell, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of\" and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused. \n\nHe's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement.\n\n\nINFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom.\n\n\nSo My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space \"from me\". This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",

        "text": "I (21m) have a son who just turned 1, his mum who was my girlfriend died in labour along with the other baby she was carrying. I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.\n\nI had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.\n\nMy mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home. I understand that things are terrible for her right now as I won't be here soon but my aunt is a much better choice. It's not like my son won't know who she is as the walk between hers and my aunts is only 5 minutes. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

So advanced happy new year.\n\nI'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.\n\nFamily from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.\n\nAs is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. \n\nWhile listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. \n\nShe began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. \n\nNow, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. \n\nI don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said \"I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?\" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, \"You guys made your first million yet? Because I have.\" \n\nThe room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.\n\nWas I an asshole?\n\nP.S. First million in our local currency not USD.",

I got mad at her for this, I was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, I mean I could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.\n\nI yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, I told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, I told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.\n\nShe got mad and left, I basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, I called the guys and told them I wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that I'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a \"plastic leg\" over her.\n\nI had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.\n\nHave I been an a**** to her ?\n\n\nEdit: for those asking about where I am, I'm in Asia, From Philippines.",

My sister works a full time job (40+ hours a week, cleans her entire house, cooks, takes care of all her children without him doing ANYTHING. It is seriously mind blowing that she wakes up at like 4 am, cooks breakfast, does chores, gets all of her kids ready for school, takes them all to school and daycare and all he does is stay home and work and when his kids get home (after my sister picks them up of course) he will play with them for a little and play video games until he falls asleep. she actually makes MORE than him! My fianc\u00e9 (M 26) and i had to stay with them for 6 weeks while our home was being renovated and since we both wfh, we helped her and it is AMAZING how much happier she is when she has help. I helped with the kids and my fianc\u00e9 even drove her to doctors appointments. Her husband literally only acknowledges he is a parent when his family is around, then he is a god fearing, hard working, father of 5. he is the one that wanted more kids, she wanted to stop after her last baby but he \u201cneeded more boys\u201d. I am seriously concerned not only for her, but her kids as well because now her oldest is seeing what\u2019s happening and trying to help but my sister is prideful and refuses to let her child do anything. \n\nMe and this man have never gotten along. He\u2019s been acting like this since their 8 year old was born. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about leaving but she doesn\u2019t want her kids to grow up in a broken home, and unfortunately her experience with our parents divorce was completely different than mine so she doesn\u2019t understand that a divorce would benefit her kids here because she thinks they need their mom and dad together. \n\nCut to this past weekend, her and her husband threw a pre thanksgiving pot luck where our entire family + his was there. I stayed with my sister a few days before because i knew he wouldn\u2019t help. So we\u2019re at dinner all talking and i mention we are trying for a babyand my BIL makes an off handed comment to him about how hard fatherhood is, and i snapped and said \u201clike you would know\u201d he looked taken aback and asked me what i meant and i unloaded on him, calling him a pathetic excuse for a man who makes my 8 months pregnant sister do everything for their family. i went off for a solid 10 minutes and he sat there shrinking in his seat. i left.\n\nLast night my sister called me and thanked me for standing up for her and told me she appreciated me. Although today i got a very nasty text from him telling me i\u2019m a terrible person and because i \u201clied\u201d in front of his family his mom is angry at him and is moving in with them to help her out and i\u2019ve made him the laughing stalk of his family. He certainly thinks so, but AITA for doing this?",

He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he\u2019s got my parents convinced he just doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing, and they don\u2019t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he\u2019s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.\n\nThe problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I\u2019m sorry that they feel that way, but I\u2019m still going. Well here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they\u2019d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.\n\nI got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn\u2019t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I\u2019d just not live my life because of him?\n\nShe started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I\u2019m refusing.

I did not \"pick a black sounding name to make this post sound racist\" or whatever nonsense people on r/amitheangel are spewing and DMing me about. Surprise surprise!

I don't care if you think this post is fake, but to assume that just because here is a name you are not familiar with you think I am bound to be racist, it makes you racist yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.\n\nI asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.\n\nMy daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "AITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?\n\nI'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. \nI tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.\n I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating \" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now\" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of \" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me.\" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.\n \nI feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.",

        "text": "\nI 31M) recently had my cousin M21) move in with me after he got kicked out of his college dorm and had no job to pay for rent. My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets \"family\" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.\n\nI been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.\n\nI saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. \n\nHe realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank \"bro\" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue \"family\" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll \"raise\" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.\n\nEDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is.",

        "text": "My late best friend and I knew each other since we were little. We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.\n\nOne day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren\u2019t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.\n\nA few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our \"wedding anniversary\" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.\n\n4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.\n\nToday was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it\u2019s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.\n\nI was furious at her comments because she wasn\u2019t just a \u201cdead girl\u201d. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It\u2019s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.\n\nWhen I told her that I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came back home yet.",

I had to go to my mother's house today to pick up an important document that I left behind when I moved out seven years ago.\n\nAs soon as I got to the house, my mother suddenly had a massive 'emergency' and realised that it was apparently her friend's funeral today and she completely forgot about it. I couldn't help but internally roll my eyes, as there is always some drama hence why I have gone no/very low contact. \n\nShe asked me if I would watch my two younger brothers (7 and 11) whilst she went to the funeral, and I said absolutely not, as it's my only day off, I have plans, and I have no relationship with them due to my mother stopping them from seeing me for years. I just wanted to get my birth certificate and leave. \n\nMy mother asked her friend if she would babysit and asked me to stay for 10 minutes until her friend came. I didn't even get the opportunity to say no before my mother left the house. I was seething but resolved to wait 10 minutes. My mother's friend turned up and started berating me for not agreeing to look after my brother's whilst my mother went to the funeral. \n\nI said 'I don't have anything to do with my mother, it's my day off work, and I'm under no obligation to look after anyone else's children'. My mother's friend then told me to 'go to my room'. I laughed in her face and started to leave the house, and she asked me where I was going. And I told her, 'my room, at my apartment, that I pay for with my big girl job. Because I'm an adult, not a child. And don't ever speak down to me like that again'. And I left. \n\nMy mother has left me loads of messages and missed calls saying I'm an AH for the way I spoke to her friend. I do admit I look kinda young but I still am not happy with the way my mother's friend spoke to me.\n\nAITA?",

If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.\n\nMy daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.\n\nI was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.\n\nMy ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected.

We have two kids, M8 and F6.\n\nMy wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.\n\nI don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.\n\nMy MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not \"college house party bass tearing apart the walls\" loud but it is still loud.\n\nMy kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.\n\nMy wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.\n\nI've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.\n\nMy FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.\n\nHe complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through \"a bit of everyday noise\".\n\nI told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.\n\nI've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.\n\nI decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.\n\nMy FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. \n\nI'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards!",

I was like \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. At first, I was like \u201cHell no.\u201d But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I\u2019m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\n\n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it\u2019s weird).\n\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\n\n3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\n\n4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman\u2019s history with her father? \n\n5. What\u2019s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\n\nI know, I\u2019m not the girl\u2019s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \n\nSo, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I\u2019m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \n\nAfter only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is \u201cNone of my business.\u201d I got a little pissed at that. \n\nI told him he\u2019s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I\u2019m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. I replied that I\u2019m uncomfortable having a dude who\u2019s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you\u2019re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.\n\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it\u2019s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\n\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?\n\nEDIT: some info:\n\nI asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.\n\nI would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \n\nWhen I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\n\nI would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what\u2019s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They\u2019re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. \n\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. \n\nAsked why they broke up.\n\nThe guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.",

Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly.\n\nAnyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's \"allowed\" to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married.\n\nFew days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him.\n\n\nHe sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him.\n\nHe's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting.\n\n\nAITA for blowing up on him infront of his family?\n\nHere's some cat tax https://imgur.com/a/lOUovCh",

My wife is 4 months pregnant. \n\nHowever, her friend wanted to hang out with her and had called her the night before my birthday. My wife said that this was a childhood friend of hers and that she really wanted to spend time with her. I reminded her that it's my birthday but she just dismissed it saying my birthday comes every year but her friend will be leaving for Germany in a few weeks. I told her that she could go after my birthday as well but she did not listen and just went to a sleepover at her friend's place. \n\nI got really mad at her and instead of waiting for her to return home to talk things out, I asked my friend if he would like to hang out with me. He was fine with it so we spent the day fishing, grilling, hiking, and went to the Korean BBQ for dinner. \n\nWhen she came home after spending time with her friend, she apologized to me saying it was an unavoidable circumstance. I told her that it wasn't a problem and that I spent the day with my best friend. She got mad that I'd take him to the restaurant that we had booked for ourselves. I said that it was originally for us but since she prioritized her friend over me, I took the person who prioritized me on my birthday. She said that I'm controlling and that I shouldn't be deciding who she spends time with. \n\nNow she's neither talking to me nor coming out of the room. I think I went too far by telling her whom she should be spending time with.  \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.\n\nWhen Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.\n\nWhen I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.\n\nMy sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.\n\nShe keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.\n\nWe had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said \"auntie keeps turning the wifi off\". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.\n\nWhen we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone \"forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter\" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.\n\nSince leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.\n\nAITA?",

We do not live together because we're waiting til marriage given he and his family are highly conservative Christians but they're really nice and loveable people.\n\n\n\nI had plans to spend NYE with Sam but he said he was out for NYE dinner celebration with his parents then called me again inviting me to join them and I happily did.\n\nHis parents were there, <they welcomed me and ordered many dishes and desserts and drinks. We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay.\n\nI pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that we'll split the check between us. Sam mumbled \"no you don't have to, we invited you\" but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me; I asked what was wrong and both MIL & FIL said they didn't have money on them. I was shocked I turned to Sam and he said he too forgot his wallet at home and didn't bring enough money to cover even on round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously \"aright so guess we should let the doctor pay!!\" I was taken a back I said I'm sorry but no this is just so much money to spend on one dinner by myself and I didn't think I was expected to pay the entire bill. Sam said I should pay and he'd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said I'm sorry but this isn't the first time I've been put in this situation by him and family where I'm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expectbothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner. I told them I'll only pay for what I had and that's it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting as if they were strangers not family but that doesn't mean I'm obligated to pay, how could someone go out to a fancy restuarant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money?. Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out.\n\n\nSam called later at 2am basically yelling that I ruined NYE celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill amd instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay even if I have a good salary doesn't mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didn't reply he just said he'll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them.\n\nI felt awful thinking I should've covered the bill instead of leaving.

Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \"fun\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \"acceptable\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\n\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \"green\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \"cheese\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\n\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \"unethical\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\n\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.\n\n**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",

My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\n\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nWell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?\n\nEdit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as \"why are you so shity?\" because I've been banned.\n\nEdit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201cbaby gangster\u201d who has been running an \u201cillegal gaming operation\u201d (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\n\nEdit3: gotta address this one directly:\n\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.\n\nIf the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201cwinner\u201d thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process.\n\nEdit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201cafford\u201d to give it to him. \n\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201chey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201d You would say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\n\n\nEdit5: a good question:\n\n>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.\n\nNo he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.\n\nEdit6: another good question\n\n>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?\n\n\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nEdit7: \n\n>INFO\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\n\nSo this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine \"nerd\" could correct me if I'm way off base.\n\nEdit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.\n\n> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.\n\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\n\n1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\n\n2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the \"you're a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \n\n3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. \n\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \n\n5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).\n\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\n\n>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEdit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\n\n\nEdit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the \"malfunction voids all pays and plays\" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",

If it's too hard to be decent to your kids then you shouldn't be a parent. maybe u should've helped your abusive ex husband around the house more, maybe u shouldn't have had dinner 10 minutes late, bc you know his job is stressful and it's hard being a provider and father.

How could I as a child stop the abusive behavior of an adult when as an adult you couldn't stop your husband from abusing you.\" \n\nShe cried and walked off.

        "text": "I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>\nWho likes to crash at our house with her friends. \n\nMy wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.\nMy sister said it\u2019s not her. I believe my sister. I just don\u2019t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.\n\nLast week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. \n\nMy wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn\u2019t enough for her and her friends.\nThey wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.\n\nThey ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have a key to our house.\n\nI tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d anymore.\n\nMy mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.\n\nMy mom didn\u2019t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn\u2019t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. \n\nAm I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. \nBetween my wife and my sister.\n\nUpdate* sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.\n\nI talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn\u2019t allowed over without me home. \n\nI asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it\u2019s clean.\n\nThe last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife\u2019s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.\n\nAlso my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.\n\nI did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.\n\nUpdate: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife\u2019s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.\n\nThe big thing is she had my wife\u2019s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife\u2019s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn\u2019t valuable it\u2019s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.\n\nLast update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. \nI already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn\u2019t have that key.\n\nEarly morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.\nMy wife said \u201chave her meet me every morning at 5 am.\u201d I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife\u2019s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife\u2019s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.\n\nMy sister was silent the whole time coming back home.\nI can tell it really hit her that her life isn\u2019t as hard. Even being grounded.\n\nLast and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.\n1) for awhile no family at our home\n2) no family borrowing our things. \n3)no one is allowed a key\n4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.\n5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. \nMy wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn\u2019t want to cause more issues but she just doesn\u2019t trust my sister and can\u2019t have her using out things.",

        "text": "\nMy husband had a serious injury weeks ago. He's bed ridden and his family come to see him everyday.\nMIL keeps \"drilling\" what I need to do to make my husband comfortable but does nothing to help. Just visits everyday and sits around expecting to be fed and entertained. Sometimes BIL, his wife & kids join them and turn the house into a mess.\n\nYesterday MIL, her husband and son came again. They checked on my husband then went to sit in the living room for hours. I served them coffee and croissant. Hours later my husband threw up again (2nd time) I had to take care of changing his clothes and cleaning the sheets to avoid infections.\nI was exhausted, I came downstairs and MIL looked at me and asked \" hey where's our dinner?\".\n\nI was shocked that after seeing me go up and downstairs many times and cleaning and bringing new sheets and running the washing machine that she'd expect me to prepare dinner. I'd already eaten a sandwich at 6 and yogurt ( I have problems with my stomach and stress and pregnancy made it worse, I'm 4 months in)\n\n\nI pointed at the kitchen and told her to help herself out. She gave me a look then said she didn't expect me to ask *her* to cook dinner at *my* house. I said I didn't expect her to ask ME to cook dinner while I'm taking care of her son. She started arguing about the way I spoke about my husband saying as his partner, *this is the least I could do* and called me unhinged for throwing in her face that I'm helping my husband.\n\nShe got her husband involved asking what his thoughts were on me making guests go hungry and forcing them to cook themselves when this supposed to be my duty as a host/home owner. FIL said they could order food and call it a day and yelled at my younger BIL to stop playing on his phone and order food but MIL got mad and lashed out criticizing me saying I wasn't up to the challenge of taking care of my home and my guests like an adult. I lost it on her and told them to leave since she kept yelling disrupting my husband's sleep. She left after saying she felt sorry for her son and grandbaby with an \"aggressive wife and a mother like me\".\n\nShe told everyone and my older BIL said he understood I'd a lot on my plate but lectured me about how I should have respect for his mom who was a guest. Repeatedly saying if that was his wife she wouldn't have acted this way. And that I shouldn't use taking care of my husband against them. He asked me to apologize but I didn't.\n\nInfo: My husband suffers from 2 major injuries and he's got a long recovery ahead. Right now there's so much pressure to take care of him while keeping up with house chores and work. My mom and sister help but not MIL. She claimed that when I told them to leave I was refusing to let her see her sick son but I'd never do that. I lost a loved one before seeing them so I understand her fear but BIL thought that was my goal.\n\nEDIT: I live in the states, in the south.",

        "text": "A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated \"No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you.\" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.\n\nYesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.\n\nA few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified \"not formal\" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.\n\nWas I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.\n\nEdit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.\n\nEdit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.",

        "text": "Me (29M) and my wife (30F) have a little girl (8F) who I'll be calling Anna.\n\nNow, Anna has very thick, blonde and curly hair that my wife adores. Ever since she was a toddler, she'd spend hours doing her hair every day, braiding it, straightening it and styling it in all sorts of ways. Our bathroom cabinets are always filled to the brim with a bunch of hair lotions, oils, creams and other fancy products I don't even know the names of. So I think it's more than fair to say that my wife's a bit obsessed with the whole hair thing. Anna, however, has never been too fond of getting her hair done, or of anything that involves having to sit still for more than a few minutes.\n\nBefore she got it cut, her hair used to reach past her waist. And while it looked lovely, she hated getting it brushed and every morning used to be a screaming fest between her and my wife. Lately, she'd been begging for a shorter haircut. My wife ignored her whenever the topic was brought up in hopes that she'd forget about it, but none of that ended up happening. \n\nI think Anna realized she was getting nowhere with her mom, because she started asking me to take her instead. I was reluctant to at first because I didn't know how my wife would react, but I agreed when I saw just how excited the kid was over something as simple as a haircut.\n\nSo yesterday I drove her to the hairdresser, where she got to flip through a lot of magazines and pick a picture of a haircut. And when she chose a really short clipper cut, I knew I was gonna be in deep shit with my wife. At that point though, there was no turning back. I mean, what could I have really done? Told her that no, she can't get the haircut she was so over the moon about, all because her mom wouldn't like it? I couldn't do that.\n\nSo we went ahead with the haircut, and by the end of it Anna couldn't stop smiling. She went around the salon showing it off to everyone and even asked me to take a bunch of pictures even though she normally hates having pictures taken of her. We did get one rude comment from an older woman at the salon, something along the lines of 'You can't even tell if she's a boy or a girl now', but Anna was way too excited about her hair to notice, and if she did notice she didn't care.\n\nWhen my wife got home from work that day though, things quickly took a turn for the worse. She refused to even look at Anna, locked herself in her room and cried then got in the car and drove off. It's been a day now and she's still not back, it's honestly starting to worry me. I knew she wouldn't react well to the haircut but I wasn't expecting her to take it this badly. The kid's upset too and no matter how much I reassure her she still thinks she's in trouble for getting her hair cut. \n\nAITA? I realize how attached my wife was to Anna's hair, but at the end of the day I still think it's just hair. The kid's old enough to decide these things for herself and she was really happy with the haircut, so I don't think I did something wrong here.",

His family is a stereotypical country one and they get ridiculously mad when they see beyond meat etc adverts on the tv. They\u2019re practically vegan phobic and hate any menu which says suitable for vegetarians or vegans etc. This never really bothered me and I thought it was funny because I ate meat and I didnt think it was a big deal.\n\nMy daughter (now6) was born allergic to a lot of things, like eggs and is also intolerant to lactose and grass, pollen etc. She rarely got to go to birthday parties because we couldn\u2019t let her eat anything there. when she was a baby my husband ate an egg sandwich and kissed her and she broke out in hives and we had to take her to the doctor. All new foods were tried under medical supervision.\n\nWhile she can eat meat she can\u2019t eat any fun meat like nuggets because of egg contact. One of the kids she recently met with is our new Neighbour who is around four houses away. They are completely vegan and their son doesn\u2019t eat anything they don\u2019t. So at his birthday she could eat the actual  cake and not a muffin I\u2019d sent. It cheered her up and they had play dates even when we weren\u2019t supposed to. I was glad she made a friend.\n\nHis parents  hadn\u2019t called for a while and didn\u2019t pick up ours. When I saw his dad while I was out I was like \u2018hey what\u2019s wrong\u2018 and he was really hostile, telling me to never talk to him or his wife again and that he\u2019d pray for my daughter. I thought that was crossing the line. He pulled his phone out and showed me a very rude text from my husband. I didn\u2019t believe his story that my husband started a fight, but when I asked him about it he was proud that Shelia wasn\u2019t hanging out with hippies. I remembered the vegan hate and I was like until he apologized to that family and they agreed to let their kid play with ours I\u2019d never cook meat again. He said I needed to get over it and do my Job but I am cooking, just not what he would like. AITA\n\nEdit: I will try to find couple\u2019s counseling although I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll agree to it. I hope Ina forgives me (vegan mom, since this blew up, I\u2019m really very sorry and I won\u2019t bother you again.) thank you all for your responses.",

        "text": "I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.\n\nWe hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.\n\nOn Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.\n\nI got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.\n\nI fucking screamed \"What the hell are you doing?!\" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.\n\nAfter I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that \"ugly ass\" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.\n\nBlack Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.\n\nI asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned \"Get the fuck out of my house. Now.\" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.\n\nOf course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't \"graciously\" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an \"honest mistake\" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said \"You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that.\" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.\n\n**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",

        "text": "My wife and I have a 3 year old daughter, Alexis. Both of us work and Alexis has attended daycare since she was 1. In the 2 years since, we have been asked to leave 2 programs because my wife is a micromanager. I admit both of us went into the first program not really understanding daycare. I quickly learned that they can\u2019t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. **She\u2019s in therapy and is working on it.**\n\nFirst program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn\u2019t understand why the other child wasn\u2019t punished for it. This daycare didn\u2019t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming \u201cone of those moms\u201d. \n\nWe chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn\u2019t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won\u2019t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn\u2019t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part. \n\nThen, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled. She said at this point, she will only be responding at specific times of the day and not looking the rest. The owner then added sent several pages of the contract with passages highlighted, reminding us of certain policies my wife had violated.\n\nI was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget. My wife made a million excuses, including that it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s anxious. I said if we are asked to leave this program too, my wife will be the one quitting her job to watch Alexis, not me. This upset my wife. I pointed out I\u2019ve spoken to her kindly about this plenty of times. I encourage her to keep up her therapy. But she can\u2019t keep getting us kicked out of programs. My wife is now not speaking to me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I cannot be the primary contact for daycare due to not being able to have my phone on me at work.",

Together 4 years. \n\nPersonally I didn't want the child, my work was offering potential advances within my position and I was excited for it. But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into. And thankfully my dad has been able to cover the cost of a private therapist and I see her again Tuesday. \n\n\nThank you all so much again for your kind words\n\n\n2nd edit: if I had realised this was going to blow up so much then I probably would have just posted to my main.\n\nIf you see this post anyway, read it Lewis. Then read it again. Then read the comments. Then just leave me alone. \n\n\nThank you all for your comments. I'm going to show my therapist the post when I see her and talk it through, but honestly it has helped alot. Even if I did cry quite a bit. I'm going to sleep now and won't be back on this post. But thank you all \u2665\ufe0f",

        "text": "Caught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said \u201cshe was sick of all the weeds\u201d and thought she was doing me a solid.\n\n1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees\n\n2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it\u2019s literally poisoning my pets.\n\nSo anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.\n\nNow 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I\u2019ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) \n\nSo I\u2019m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. \n\nShe\u2019s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it\u2019s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I\u2019m not risking another animal\u2019s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I\u2019m being unnecessarily cruel because it \u201cwas an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is\u201d and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills\n\nEdit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before\n\nI don\u2019t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of\n\nHer: \u201chey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cyup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn\u201d \n\nHer: \u201cSomething about my new car.\u201d\n\nThe end\n\nSince she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she\u2019d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn\u2019t get to that week would be sprouting\n\nEdit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.\n\nEdit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said \u201cit\u2019s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick\u201d\n\nEdit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn\u2019t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can\u2019t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.\n\nUPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. \n\nMy 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He\u2019ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready \n\nFor those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven\u2019t responded, probably won\u2019t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. \n\nAnd for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn\u2019t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.\n\nPlease in the future; avoid messaging me for updates \n\nI have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that\u2019s just beyond rude STOP IT. Im allowed to make other posts without being reminded of this; you\u2019ll get updates as they come and as I please not as you demand. Thank you.",

        "text": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to \"toughen\" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.\n\nWhen my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet \"hooks\" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.\n\nAfter that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.\n\nWhen I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.\n\nMy dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just \"toughen\" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?\n\nEdit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not \"needles.\" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a \"needle.\" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.\n\nEdit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college.",

        "text": "There\u2019s this girl that lives in my uni halls, we\u2019re not roommates but we are flatmates. Let\u2019s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We\u2019re not best friends but we are friendly. We don\u2019t really spend much time together.  \n\n\nOver time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn\u2019t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don\u2019t owe the style and she\u2019s free to wear what she likes but it\u2019s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.\n\n\nBut then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I couldn\u2019t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I\u2019d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. \nI joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. \nBasically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It\u2019s just really creepy but I haven\u2019t said anything, I wouldn\u2019t even know what to say.\n\nOver the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.\n\nI deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it\u2019s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.\nShe kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it\u2019s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she\u2019s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?",

We have 2 kids (Jeremy 16 & Raya 14) now Jeremy is a jokester, he likes pulling pranks on everyone in the house...and that included the house keeper. He did stuff like throw her purse, hide her wallet and got punished for  it then told to not do it again because our house keeper almost quit and we didn't wanr that.\n\n\nNow onto the current situation...sone days ago I got a call from Jeremy while he was having friends over telling me he saw the house keeper sneak one of my jewelry into her purse and asked me to come home immediately. I freaked out and tried to call my husband but he didn't pick. I went home and was mad, I talked to the house keeper and she denied putting anything in her purse, I demanded to see her purse and my jewelry was there. The house keeper started swearing on her children that she didn't put it in there and had no idea how it got there....I believed her and figured Jeremy had something to do with it given his history. I switched my attention towards him and had him explain to me exactly how he saw our house keeper do it. He told me what he saw but a friend of his came forward and said that he saw Jeremy put the jewelry inside the lady's purse and was trying to get her in trouble. Jeremy yelled at his friend then told me it was just one of his pranks but I was furious, I kicked the rest of his friends who covered for him out and I punished him hard and apologized to the house keeper.\n\nMy husband reacted unexpectly after he heard and said that I was wrong for choosing to believe the house keeper over our son even though there was a witness but he said his friend must've said this to get him in trouble or because the house keeper paid him to side woth her which was shockingly absurd of him to say. He said I was not being a good mother and my first instinct is to always believe my son in whatever he says amd never ever question him infront of his friends like that.\n\nI'm confused, did I mess up?",

My parents seem to be ignoring it since Joanne pays her rent on time and keeps to herself when she's in the house and doesn't cause many problems. \n\nI'm a college student on a government grant, and I'm in college Monday to Friday up until 5/6pm, working isn't really an option for me right now, so I don't go out much and I spend all my money on college supplies. Joanne doesn't seem to understand this and is always asking to borrow money and what not. I always say no because it works out that I only have \u20ac40 every week to spend on college stuff and travel to college. \n\nI got a Christmas bonus on my grant and I ended up deciding to book tickets for a small ish local gig that's next week. I booked two, one for me and one for my best friend because her birthday is the same day and she loves the type of music, it was meant to be a surprise for her. I had told Joanne about this on one of her \"good days\" because I was genuinely excited to finally do something and live the college student lifestyle for a night. \n\nThe tickets were digital, on an account shared with my parents. Joanne had asked for the login telling them that she wanted to book tickets to something, but she was lying and used it to sell my tickets for drug money. I didn't find out until I had gotten the email to confirm that the tickets were sent to someone else and I was really confused at first. I checked and they were sent to someone I know Joanne knows. \n\nI went straight to her when she got home and asked what the fuck she did, and she tried lying but I showed her proof it went to someone she knows and told her I wanted my money back then and there. She told me it was gone already. I lost my mind and started yelling at her, because it wasn't fair. \n\nMy mom was just in from work and I was screaming at my sister who was crying at that point saying she was sorry and she didn't know it would upset me this much. My mom got involved and told me to keep my voice down and we'll talk about it, and I told her to shut up and stay out of it. I ended up saying something along the lines of \"why is it fair that you get to do this to me when I've never even drank alcohol or smoked weed, why does the cokewhore get to be the golden child bit not me?\". \n\nMy mom stepped in and put a stop to it then and there, my sister had started screaming back at me for what I called her. My mom said that was out of line and she just made a mistake. I told my mom her mistake cost me the only night out ill have been able to have all year so she should hear what I have to say about it. My mom thinks I was in the wrong for what I said, and my sister won't even look at me even though its been 3 days and I've tried apologising. AITA?",

        "text": "I (21F) was in a very bad car accident about three years ago. A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nEarlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nHe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said \"Okay\", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.\n\nMy group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd. AITA?\n\nEdit: in case anyone was interested: I'm not going to post a photo of my leg because of identification reasons but I'll describe it. So the base color is ombre whiteish green to pale green and it has cherry blossoms painted on it, though sometimes I wear a silicone cover that resembles an actual foot and leg on days when I don't want people to stare at me. I even have temporary stickies I can put on the \"toes\" to make it look like I painted my nails. It's actually really cool!",

        "text": "My cousin turned 18 recently. She\u2019s in high school. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn\u2019t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I\u2019m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. Anyway\n\nMy cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. \n\nShe begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she\u2019s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t respond to her and think nothing of it. \n\nThe weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don\u2019t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP\u2019d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. \n\nSince I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I\u2019m surprise she didn\u2019t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.\n\nTo save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she\u2019s \u201cjust a kid\u201d and that she\u2019s been through a lot of \u2018emotional stress\u2019 doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I\u2019m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to egg anyone\u2019s car) and can\u2019t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she\u2019s young, that she doesn\u2019t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could\u2019ve been avoided had I let her take my car. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\nI need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She\u2019s not remorseful of anything.\n\nAlso, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap.",

        "text": "\nMy fianc\u00e8 (37M) and I (33F) got engaged few months ago. We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e8 sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's \"just a confidence boost\" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.\n\nHe's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?\n\n[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",

        "text": "I'm well aware that this story sounds extremely hard to believe and fake, and I'm aware that there will be many \"shitpost\" comments below. Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.\n\nI was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.\n\nJosh, now almost 13, has been calling me \"dad\" and my wife \"mum\" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.\n\nSome of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me \"dad\" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.\n\nI discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the \"father figure\" everyone deserves.\n\nI feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying \"sooner than later\". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys.",

The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. \n\nLast week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. \n\nIt's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. \n\nSo today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. \n\nNow he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. \n\nAITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?\n\nEdit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this much of a response. Thank you all for your thoughts, upvotes, and the awards. I've gathered some useful information and I feel better knowing that people support me, even though they're strangers on the internet. Thanks guys.",

Forgive me for the vague details for privacy but I'll mention all the relevent stuff, I promise.\n\nWhen I went into labor I had the most difficult time of my life, I was in pain for hours. My mom was with me but she had to go and my husband was with me the entire time. I did something so embarrasing in the delivery room, I pooped myself which was unexpected and just...I don't know but it was embarrassing and although my medical team were very professional about it, my husband couldn't help himself and started laughing about it later and even telling my family about it but they didn't react, just didn't find it funny and neither did I, In fact, I found it embarrassing and I already told him to stop bringing it up especially when he started joking about getting me diapers for my \"opsies!!\". It got really tiring and chipped away from my selfesteem and confidence.\n\n\nWe were with his parents celebrating new year's eve together when I excused myself to the bathroom. while I was getting up he made a quick remark and said \"oh yeah, you should go quickly because we don't want any accidents just like the one we had at the hospital, you know what I mean?\" While blinking at me. His family actually laughed and BIL commented \"good one!\". I was astonished and so angry and ashamed, I literally just lost it on him and yelled at the top of my lungs calling him a cruel insensitive jerk to be using the difficult experience of birthing his child as a joking matter and humiliating me infront of everybody. He was shocked, staring back at me and not saying a word. All went silent and I just stormed off to the bathroom til we left and that was when he snapped saying I messed up by talking to him like that infront of his family during dinner, I said I couldn't hold my tongue for that long and after he kept joking about an embarrassing thing when I told him to stop. he said he was just joking and I went overboard with my reaction and also, I should've sucked it up and waited til we got home so we could address this privately and I could even yell at him as long as I wanted. We argued about it after we got home and he kept saying I humiliated him infront of his family during the celebratory evening by being petty and trying to one up him... He even said I should've laughed along not fly off the handle liks that.\n\nDid I overreact?.",

(The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.\n\nThe floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. \n\nAnother week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.\n\nLast night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of \"skirt\" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. \n\nBF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. \n\nAITA?",

We have not spoken since, we have not been in the same room for more than ten seconds and I will not have a relationship with her moving forward. This year has been rough and Covid made some things easier regarding there was no visiting family so the pressure was gone. But recently my mom wanted to have a family dinner again and I told her I would not go because I did not want to be in my sisters presence. She told me I can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. I told her I can and I will. Her response was telling me I am being unfair making her choose between us and I said I'm not making her choose because I'm fine not being invited, I know my stance means I will end up being excluded. But I will not play nice with her and my ex. Especially now that they are getting married too. We're never going to play happy families. I don't want to be civil to them. So I would rather not have anything to do with them. And they will never have anything to do with me again.\n\nMy mom thinks I'm being very unfair.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to add since this was asked: My dad died 9 years ago.",

Septum piercings are usually tagged as \u201clooking like a bull\u201d (I don\u2019t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of \u201ctake that thing out of your nose, you\u2019re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.\u201d The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn\u2019t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I\u2019m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn\u2019t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. \n\nFast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she\u2019s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I\u2019m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn\u2019t even make sense) does not \u201cruin\u201d my face and even if it does it\u2019s really not her place. I\u2019m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. \n\nSo, was I the asshole?",

I've insisted that I should stay as I don't want to live with my mom (her husband is a piece of work...) so we're always clashing.\n\nShe announced last month that she wouldn't allow me to eat anything she cooks, or cook anything that she buys and I should arange my own food completely separately (down to the ingredient level, including salt!) because I'm not her problem to deal with. This is annoying but anyway, I can handle it and I didn't want to act entitled so I started buying and cooking my own food. We've been going like this since then.\n\nHer sister had an accident a few days ago and on the day of the accident step mother texted me in the afternoon saying she's bringing the sister's children over and they'll arrive around midnight, asked me to buy groceries and snacks and make a late dinner for them. I never replied to her and didn't do anything. I have to say that while for a few hours it didn't look good for her sister and had to go into surgery it ended up being successful and she will thankfully make a full recovery.\n\nThey came, she noticed there's no food and they indeed were hungry so she was angry at me and I told her that it's not my problem to deal with... and she said I'm being a jerk and I said takes one to know one. She ended up ordering Pizza.\n\nMy dad told me that I was out of line and I should have just done what she wanted me to do because it was an emergency, and I should have done a favor for her and it would have gone a long way to improve our relationshiop. I told him that our relationship has always been hopeless because she hated me for no reason so there's nothing I can do that can make her hate me any less and at this point I've accepted it and don't care anymore. He said it's not true and I'm now grounded.",

Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. \n\nRecently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. \n\nI've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.\n\nI do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.\n\nStill, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them.",

It's sad to say that mom moved on relatively fast.\n\nMy stepsister and I share a room together (my step brother has the bigger room because he's a \"man\") and as a result me and my stepsister are always in conflict.

She recently accused me of stealing her tools and convinced her dad to get a lock so now I'm being forcefully locked out and can't get in til after a huge argument and getting mom involved.\n\n My stepsister had an argument with her brother and ruined his gaming console when he was out. He came into the room quietly in the evening. Stood by the door and asked me to bring him my stepsister's acrylic paintset. I asked if he got permission he said yes so I gave it to him and went back to study.\n\nAt dinner, my step sister came downstairs yelling that her brother had access to her room and ruined her paintset. There was a lot of yelling and arguing. Step dad asked how my step brother walked into the room when it was supposed to be locked. My step brother \"admitted\" I helped him out and brought the paintset to hi. My stepsister went off on me, called an accomplice then ran upstairs and took the gift I prepared for my dad for father's day.\n(I picked up flowers I planted from our small garden that I take care of by myself. And prepared a nice wooden letter shaped pot ~used my dad's first initial~\nand filled it with the flowers I picked and decorated it with ribbons. It wasn't that good but it was like a floral letter. I planned to visit his grave and put the gift there) she damaged it to pieces. It was completely ruined. I yelled at her and kept crying.\nmom and stepdad gave her harsh punishment and thought it was fixable but I was so done I called my uncle who came and berated my mom and stepdad. Stepdad offered to fix it and punish my stepdaughter harder but I packed my things to go with my uncle. My mom begged me to stay but I refused and didn't respond when she kept calling saying she did nothing to deserve to be shunned by me and my uncle who told the family about what happened.

        "text": "Hello, I am a fifty-six-year-old mother to thirty-three-year-old Kelly and grandmother to sixteen-year-old Opal. Kelly became pregnant with Opal at sixteen. My husband, Eddy, and I have always believed in having the right to choose. However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.\n\nWe helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn\u2019t complain about why she \u201chad to be there\" to look after Opal.\n\nKelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.\n\nKelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well. She has good friends, plays Tennis, participates in volunteer projects, and plans to be a marine biologist after graduation.\n\nThe school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend\u2019s child.\n\nWe already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal\u2019s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were \u201cso busy!\u201d with life right now.\n\nEddy and I interrupted Kelly and told her we would have nothing to do with raising this new baby and would not be providing anything for it (supplies, childcare, etc.) Kelly flipped out and an argument ensued.\n\nKelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.\n\nKelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into \u201csides.\u201d The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don\u2019t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.\n\nOpal likes to show us stories from here sometimes, so I thought it would be a good place to ask for a neutral perspective. AITA?\n\nEdit: Opal is always able to express her feelings with me or Eddy. Opal also has a therapist who is available to speak whenever she needs it. Opal visited the therapist weekly during middle school but now hasn't needed to see him more than once a month. We will be taking Opal on a mall trip to make up for what happened at the celebration dinner.\n\nWe spoke privately to Opal after this incident and she knows we in no way view her as a burden. Our granddaughter is a blessing and many of our happiest moments involved supporting Opal and watching her grow up. But Opal is sixteen: She doesn't need the kind of constant attention and care that a newborn baby does. We are now too old to be able to adequately raise a newborn baby even if we wanted to.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Kelly is now an adult and needs to start acting like one. Kelly is supposed to outlive us. The reality is that Eddy and I aren't going to be alive for her or her children's entire lives. It is why Kelly needs to accept that she cannot expect us to take on her responsibilities and must be independent.\n\nEdit #2: Several people have informed me that the part where Kelly expected us to raise the new baby was unclear, so I apologize for that. I thought it was self-explanatory, but realize none of you actually experienced what happened.\n\nKelly talked about how busy she and her boyfriend were with their lives, then began to talk about how \"grateful\" she was that we \"would always look after our grandchildren\" and how since we had \"gained so much joy from raising Opal, we would be even happier raising this second baby!\"\n\nAfter Eddy and I called her out, Kelly confirmed that she had expected us to adopt and raise this second baby as well. Kelly said how she and her boyfriend did not have time to raise a baby but that putting up the baby for adoption would be \"throwing it away.\" She assumed we, at almost sixty years old, would have no troubles or opposition to raising a newborn baby.",

        "text": "I married my husband 3 years ago. He was divorced, and previously widowered. He has two daughters. Annie who is now 26 (I believe) from his first marriage and Amy who is 17 from his second. My husband told me about his late wife, his ex wife, the issues he had as a blended family when he remarried and Annie was not on board with him remarrying and the fact this strain ended his second marriage. He was also honest that Annie never forgave him for remarrying and never wanted anything to do with Amy or him after she turned 18.\n\nWhat he did not tell me was the MAJOR role he played in all of this. I found this out three weeks ago, at a dinner with his extended family.\n\nThe story as I now know it. When Amy was around 5 years old she took a special interest in a necklace that belonged to his late wife. My husband gave the necklace to Amy, which upset Annie, because all her mothers possessions were meant to go to her. My husband told Annie that it was just one item and she needed to get over it because Amy was entitled to have something too. Annie had brought up that it was the piece her mother wore the most. My husband told her that it was a special gift to give to her sister. That she was being selfish. His ex wife told her that her mother would want \"someone as special as your sister\" to have a piece of her as well. Annie never got over it. She tried to take it from Amy and was punished. The last time she saw any of them she told them all to go to fucking hell.\n\nAmy still has the necklace too. She has let it get into a bad way, and talks about it as if her dad bought it for her.\n\nI was shocked. I never would have expected my husband to be that way. He was very unapologetic about it and told me Annie would have to get over it some day. I told him he should be ashamed of himself. That he should have allowed Annie's mothers possessions to be hers, to do with as SHE chose, that Amy did not give a crap about his late wife or the significance of those items, but Annie would have. I told him he will be incredibly lucky if his daughter ever speaks to him again and I would not blame her if she never did.\n\nHe was furious I judged him. His family said I should take my husbands side over his daughter who I don't even know (except for the nephew and niece who told the whole story, because they also think my husband did a fucked up thing).\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "\nContext: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send \"samples\" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the \"food menu\". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.\n\n\n\nFor this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a \"cookie sample\" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.\n\n\nI came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said \"it was done\" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.\n\n\nLater I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.\n\n\n\nAITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?\n\n\nInfo. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.\n\n\nInfo Few things to put on here:\n\n1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.\n\n2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.\n\n3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.\n\n\nUpdate: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.",

        "text": "First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.\n\nI got an inquiry for a group called \"Womens+ Adventures\" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.\n\nThe group wanted to work up to \"A 14er\" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.\n\nWhen I arrived for our first group hike, I learned \"Womens+\" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  \n\nThe first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. \n\nAfter we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all \"homework\" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.\n\n2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.\n\nPlease, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. \n\nI refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.\n\nAITA?",

I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. \n\nHe refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it. I asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. Then went back to not speaking to me.\n\n\nI'm genuinely confused, AITA?",

His sister, Claire, has a 1 year old baby, Alex. \n\nClaire is a single mom and sometimes drops her baby off at our place when she has some errands to run. I will be honest here. I have no clue how to take care of a baby. I play with the baby but other than that my BF usually takes care of Alex. \n\nMy BF work is onsite. So he usually isn't home for 4 days and then comes home for 3 days. One day, Claire asked my BF if she can drop off Alex for the day. BF was supposed to leave for work that evening. Since she had said that she will pick up the baby by evening, he didn't mention that. Big mistake. He left around 5 pm. \n\nI was waiting for Claire and kept calling her. She picked up the phone around 8 pm and told me that she went to a place few hours away with her friends. She told me to tell BF to take care of Alex for next 3-4 days. I told her that BF already left for work. Then she just told me \"Then you take care of Alex. I will back in 4 days.\" And then she hung up on me and switched off her phone. \n\nI freaked out hard. I cannot call BF because he is unreachable onsite. Neither of us have family in the state that we could have called. I called few friends but no one gave me anything helpful. The bag she gave with Alex only had diapers left in it. The baby was crying her head off and I didn't even know what to feed her safely. \n\nI literally didn't know how else to do. So, I called the police and told them what happened. They directed me to a social worker. While the social worker was helping me take care of the baby, the cops called the cops where she was to locate her. \n\nThe cops found her high marijuana and she had enough on her for them to classify it as possesion and intention to sell (Edit: I don't think she actually sold anything. She probably just brought enough for her and her friends for the next few days). She didn't get any jail time. She had to do community service and plead guilty. Unfortunately, that also meant she got a felony conviction. This got her fired and she hasn't been able to hold on to a good job since. \n\nIn my defense, I only wanted her to come back because I didn't want anything to happen to Alex because I am not capable of taking care of her. I did not think she was doing anything that would get her arrested. \n\nIn her defense, she has left Alex at our home plenty of times, so it's not unreasonable for her to think that I would have no problem taking care of Alex for a few days. Also, this was probably the first time she took a break for herself since Alex was born. \n\nMy boyfriend was pissed in the beginning but came around later. Their parents also think I wasn't in the wrong. She obviously hates me and thinks I ruined her life because she wanted a break for a few days. \n\nThis got brought up recently at a family dinner which is why I ask. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "Backstory. My house used to belong to my parents. But they sold it to me in 2017. It had been a family vacation home of sorts. Every couple years when my grandparents were alive they'd invite us kids up there for a week. Fast forward to the end of 2016. My sister got accepted to her dream college. Wont say which but it's a big one. Everyone was excited and proud of her, me too. But a week after that my parents called asking if I'd found a house yet.\n\nI was looking for one and my family knew it. I'd been saving up since I started my first job at 20. I said no so my dad suggested I buy the lake house from them. I asked why they wanted to sell it. Turns out sis didn't have any savings for college and didn't get some scholarship like she'd planned? And our parents couldn't afford to pay for everything either. I asked why she didn't get student loans and they said they didn't want her ruining her credit. So their solution was to sell the lake house and use the money from that to finance her college.\n\nI had lots of good memories from the lake house so eventually I agreed. I work via computer so after getting a good internet connection out there I moved right in, and been there since. My gf moved in permanently last year before lockdown and it's been pretty blissful.\n\n2019 my sister & her college bf got engaged. Parents agreed to pay for her wedding. But like with every other wedding around then things got set back. Sis had to postpone her wedding until this year. She plans to have it in Dec. I even agreed to be in the bridal party.\n\nIssues came up recently when my sis asked where I was going to stay for the 2 weeks after her wedding? Puzzled I answered my house? She got a sour look and said that wouldn't work, her and fiance would be there and they wanted private time. I asked why they'd be at my house and she said that's where they were having their honeymoon. Two weeks alone at a lake house. I said that was news to me. She insisted our parents said it was fine. But I said it wasn't their place to make decisions about my house.\n\nAfter arguing she called our parents who said I was being unreasonable. I said I didn't want my sister and her fiance christening their new union by fucking in my house. They said I was being gross and selfish. I said no again so sis threatened to remove me from the bridal party. I just shrugged and said okay. She starts crying, saying she already couldn't have her dream wedding like she wanted and now I was trying to ruin her honeymoon too. I told her to rent a hotel room like every other newlywed couple then hung up.\n\nShe's not speaking to me and I'm uninvited to the wedding. Our parents keep calling me and saying I should do this for her since her wedding is only 1/3 what she wanted it to be. But I'm not comfortable with them staying unsupervised at my house. They're making me feel like a monster for saying no. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nWell uh, learned something new today. I spoke to my sister like a few people suggested and asked her if she knew the lake house was legally MY house. As in, I bought it years ago. \n\nShe was NOT in fact aware of this. She was under the impression from our parents that they were letting me live there rent free...... I corrected her and even showed her proof that they sold the house to me. And when she asked why they sold it I was honest and said it was to pay for her college tuition/lifestyle. She became quiet after that and we soon hung up. \n\nNo idea what's going to happen now.",

I don't know how to say this but all those women I mentioned above are into teasing and joking. They've formed a unit (which I admit is kind of toxic) and they'd tease and roast every new woman that enters the family by marriage by setting up \"tests\" to see if they deserve to be part of the family. Or roast their looks and styles to the point of breaking confidence and self esteem down. Then after a few months of teasing they'd announce that they've finally welcomed them into the family. The newest member would join in on the teasing too which is crazy as my dad says.\n\nWhen I first introduced my then girlfriend now wife. I made it clear that I didn't want any of the women in the unit to come at her or harass her not even with a single word. They went behind my back and roasted her looks and job and I discovered they've been doing it on Facebook. I had them apologize one by one after they gave the \"we're just testing the water to see if she's capable to be part of the family\" excuse\". They didn't want to apologize but once I said I wouldn't invite any of the unit unless they apologize including my mom everyone immediately apologized and brought gifts for my wife. First of them was my stepmom and my SIL.\n\n\nMy wedding was 2 weeks ago. There was talk about the women in the family wanting to pull a prank on my wife by wearing white and called it the \"ultimate test\" to see how my wife react. My brother warned me so I announced that if anyone of them showed up in white I'd have them kicked out including mom. They said this wasn't true and they'd never do such thing. But they showed up to my wedding one by one wearing white dresses and each an every one of them was told to leave after they tried giving excuses by either making scenes or getting the men involved. The senior women of the unit who are Mom and aunts also showed up in white but refused to leave. I threatened to take harsher action and mom was pissed telling me to step aside but I didn't let her in. I had her leave while the men in the family were watching stunned, dad was on my side and supported me a lot. I felt absolutely awful because my wedding was being interrupted by them making scenes. My wife was hurt beyond measure but the women in the family were pissed. my cousin blasted me on social media later saying I excluded all the women from the wedding because my wife was so insecure she couldn't handle another woman's presence at her wedding. I had an argument with them and mom berated me saying it was supposed to be a prank but I said they were taking it too far. Mom said I took it too far by kicking them out because they were trying to get reaction from my wife to see if she was one of those \"bridzillas\" and were going to change soon as prank was over but I ruined my own and entire wedding by reacting so aggressively. I stopped talking after she said I had to bring my wife and apologize. I haven't seen the lot of them in 2 weeks and they've excluded me from everything.\n\nWasITA for how I handled this?.\n\n____________\n\nI just want to explain that (A) this has been happening for years. The men in the family are split on this behavior, some of them encourage it like my uncle and my cousins' husbands (one is now an ex) and some are against it like me and my dad and brother.\n\n(B) the women claim that there's nothing hurtful in what they do because they claimed they're just looking out for us men and that their goal ultimately is to make sure the women who enter the family are decent.\n\n(C) My dad always ends up arguing with my mom and grandmother since they're the ones who started this  whole thing with their behavior and attitude towards other women.\n\n(D) and I'm not sure if I should mention this but my male cousin who's a middle schooler said he'd make sure to leave the country before even meeting any woman because of this and it made me chuckle.\nAlso the dresses they showed up in were simple white dresses nothing over the top but still were white dresses. I realized they went ahead with their plans even after I stated what I'd do in that case.",

        "text": "I F(25) don\u2019t have kids yet. I never really wanted them growing up but I figure I\u2019ll eventually have kids in the future once I get my life together. My cousin Sarah (29) has two bad behaved kids from a previous relationship and a newborn baby with her boyfriend MJ (40).\n\nLast night my mother, sister, Sarah and I went to a sushi restaurant - and this was my first time having sushi. After we ordered, I had a hard time using the chopsticks. My cousin started obnoxiously laughing. \n\nThe waiter came over and asked me if I wanted \u201ctraining wheels\u201d which is a little plastic item that attaches to the chopsticks and helps you hold them in place. My cousin laughed and said \u201csorry about her, she constantly embarrasses herself and us.\u201d\n\nI just gave her the side eye and put the training wheels on. When it was time to order desserts, her boyfriend MJ finally joined us - claiming that he was \u201cbusy.\u201d\nShe went on to tell him how \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d I was for not knowing how to use chopsticks and how the waiters and everyone around now know that I\u2019m an embarrassment. My mom asked her what her problem was and she goes on a rant about how I\u2019m so embarrassing and it\u2019s no wonder I\u2019m \u201cjealous of her being a mother\u201d and \u201cno one wants to have kids with me.\u201d \n\nI finally had enough. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have kids because I don\u2019t want them to come out like your rude pieces of shit\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re calling me an embarrassment? Didn\u2019t MJ just have a baby on you with his wife? Your baby literally has a sibling a week apart from her. You probably learned how to use chopsticks by eating his wife\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\nI guess when she was attacking me it was fine because everyone turned on me. \nIt got so loud that management had to get involved. Sarah was screaming and crying, MJ was yelling at me, and my mom and sister were berating me for being \u201cmean.\u201d \n\nManagement brought the bill and told us to please pay it and leave. My mom paid the entire bill but my sister said I\u2019m an AH for embarrassing Sarah and getting us kicked out - and how she\u2019s probably going through postpartum depression. \n\nNow\u2026idk if I went too far seeing as she\u2019s probably going through some post baby stress. AITA?\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThank you all for the overwhelming responses! I\u2019ve been wanting to put Sarah in her place for a while now - and I\u2019m glad I did! However, Sarah\u2019s Mom got involved and is mad at me. \n\nApparently, MJ told Sarah that him and his wife were separating. Sarah found out that he lied because she was secretly stalking his wife\u2019s Facebook page - and got the shock of her life when wifey posted a newborn baby and MJ was there for the birth.\n\nSarah did the math and realized that he got both of them pregnant the week of his birthday. She confronted him and he confirmed it. He also said that she\u2019ll have to get over it or he\u2019ll leave. \nSo, she stayed and is now constantly in shambles. Not my problem.\n\nNow onto the problem. \nShe kept the wife\u2019s baby a secret and only told her mom, who told my mom, who told my sister and I. So, they said that they were pissed because I wasn\u2019t supposed to repeat it. \n\nBUT I DIDN\u2019T KNOW IT WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. After like a week, that\u2019s all everyone talked about. \n\nSarah\u2019s mom (my aunt) reached out to me this morning and she said that Sarah\u2019s problem with me is that I always said I don\u2019t like kids and only a \u201chorrible person\u201d won\u2019t like kids - and that I was mean to her about her kids 2 months ago.\n\n2 months ago she wanted to go to a party with MJ and asked me to watch her kids. ALL THREE OF THEM. FOR FREE. I told her no because they\u2019re untrained, I don\u2019t feel comfortable watching a newborn - and she\u2019ll have to pay me to put up with the other two. \n\nSo, I guess that\u2019s why she\u2019s still holding grudges.\n\nRegardless, Sarah\u2019s mom said she was having a really hard time after finding out about the \u201coutside\u201d baby (who technically is the inside baby as Sarah\u2019s baby is the outside baby but whatever) and she wants me to apologize for putting her business out there for everyone. \n\nShe got my mom and sister involved so I just called Sarah and apologized. She just said \u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to say\u201d and hung up. \n\nRegardless. I held up my end of the bargain. Hopefully this gets blown over soon because ya girl is TIRED.",

        "text": "I thought I\u2019d give an update for all the kind people who asked for one. The original post, with a few details in the comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_grieving\\_husband\\_if\\_he\\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita_for_asking_my_grieving_husband_if_he_has/)\n\nSo, as you all suggested I sat husband down and asked if he was okay, if he had the time and mental space to talk to me, etc. I apologised for what I implied- said it was inappropriate, irrelevant, and it wasn\u2019t my place to say anything on his relationship with B.\n\nBut then he broke down, to my confusion, and started apologising to me. Said he DID have feelings for B, that I\u2019m not delusional and stupid, that he\u2019s just been gaslighting me (I disagree). Not going to give all the details, but hubby found out after B\u2019s death that B had feelings for him - and it turned out to be mutual, to his shock. He said the sudden loss and what he realised basically made him go into a very dark place where he felt unworthy of everyone, including his children, B, and I. He needed to talk about it but was terrified of losing us.Knowing my husband, I kind of saw it coming and regret that he\u2019s only confessed to it now because I never would\u2019ve resented him for loving someone. And B\u2019s gone. It\u2019s just a lot of heartbreak for everyone.\n\nSo\u2026 I insisted on therapy again and husband agreed. And he\u2019s okay, thankfully. He did have way too much on his plate but he\u2019s already faring much better now that he\u2019s finally opened up. I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for being trapped in a cycle of self-hate after all of this. He also mentioned his parents\u2019 deaths too, very briefly. This all felt liberating because we finally came back to our before, where we\u2019d share and discuss everything freely.\n\nOne surprise though, is that I ended up being diagnosed. *I am* depressed. TBH, I\u2019m still puzzled because I come from a traditional Asian family where depression is a myth. But I guess I\u2019d never questioned myself because I was just always too busy to. Parents abandoned me when I was 5, became a barrister at 21, worked 80 hours/week, taking care of my kids, charity work\u2026You know what's the funniest part? I\u2019m extremely lazy. Every second I *fight* the urge to lie down somewhere and sleep forever. I have these random moments where I question the relevance of it all but they all seem insignificant in light of everything I could lose. I\u2019m okay. I never felt like reaching a breaking point. My husband has been feeling guilty - so I slapped some sense into him and told him I\u2019m not cancerous.\n\nWe also had a talk with the kids. My oldest has been radiant since then. Youngest also likes to follow my husband around like a baby chick now. I\u2019ve become an in-house counsel, so twice as less work hours, which is really cool too haha.\n\nYeah, idk. A lot of changes but none of them feel overwhelming! Life might be a bitch (esp now) but I feel grateful. Yes, I sound like a cheesy moron.\n\nThank you so much for your help, everyone!\n\nEDIT: I might not be able to reply to every single one of you in the thread, but I want to make sure to thank you all for your support and wholesomeness. I'm genuinely touched. And thank you for the awards, kind strangers!",

He does not want to get married, which I'm fine with now, but it was a point of contention early on in our relationship.\n\nBoyfriend was talking to Co-worker on zoom when I brought him some coffee. Co-worker said something like \"so this is the lovely wife I've heard so much about\". I said something like \"thanks but we're not married\". He said \"oh, Boyfriend always calls you his wife\", and then introduced himself, I introduced myself, then ended the conversation and left as quickly I could while still being polite because both Boyfriend and Co-worker were giving me a weird vibe.\n\nA little while later, Boyfriend came out of the office and asked \"what was that?\". I didn't know what he meant so I asked \"what was what?\". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.\n\nThis somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.\n\nHe then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.\n\nI then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and \"no fucking way am I doing that\", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: We talked. He's fucking a (female) co-worker. Apparently \"I can't leave my wife for you\" sounds better than \"I can't leave my girlfriend for you\". So now he's going to have to tell people we've divorced.",

I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. \n\nMy ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. \n\nWe never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.\n\nNow, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. \n\nHere's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. \n\nThe other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying \"mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!\"\n\nWhen my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man \"daddy\" and that I needed to make her stop.\n\n I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife \"mommy\". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her \" Mommy \" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. \n\nThe next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. \n\nMy husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him \"daddy\"?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids.",

        "text": "So pretty much, there\u2019s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn\u2019t using any other personal information of mine so i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a privacy concern. \n\nSo back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I\u2019ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.\n\nWith most emails, there\u2019s a number, name and an address (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the persons address) attached. I\u2019ve tried texting the number and even calling but I\u2019ve never gotten an answer. \n\nI\u2019d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I\u2019ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can\u2019t change that since like I said, it\u2019s all attached to my email.\n\nI recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is \u201cabc\u201d his is \u201cacb\u201d) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. \n\nIn his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can\u2019t he just use his own email he said: It\u2019s always a typo I do and I don\u2019t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.\n\nI\u2019m not even joking, that\u2019s exactly what he said.\n\nSo AITA for sabotaging this guys packages?",

        "text": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d \n\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \n\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \n\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \n\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \n\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far?\n\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did.\n\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. \n\nAnd to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

        "text": "I gave birth to my son 10 weeks ago. I went through exhausting period while I was nearing my due date. I was experiencing discomfort and wanted my husband by my side when I go into labor but he'd go out every night to hang out at his friend's place and watch football games. I suggested that he play/watch games at home just in case but he was having none of it and said he had to attend game night at his brother& friend's place along with his buddies. He said they had certain... How can i describe it? \"rituals?\" when watching a game and he can't enjoy doing it at home or anywhere else.\n\nThe night of our son's birth my water broke while my husband was at his buddies place watching a game. I called him and told him to get home and take me to the hospital he said he was coming but he didn't. I ended up calling my sister (she lives nearby) and she took me to the hospital. My husband showed up 2hrs later after he kept calling asking if I was still in labor and that he was almost done watching the game.\n\nHe was able to make it on time for our son's birth but I was furious with him, mad and disappointed. He apologized profoundly and has been working on regaining my trust and respect for him after what he's done. He's otherwise very supportive and involved in our son's care.\n\nLast night I was at my in-laws house for dinner and we were talking about my son's birth date. My husband suddenly started \"recalling\" what happened that night and basically started lying about driving me to the hospital, waiting and feeling stressed out and standing on his feet for so long without food or even water. I was confused I said no! none of this was true, none of this happened in fact, he was watching a game when I went into labor and I wanted him to drive me to the hospital but didn't show up til 2 hours later. My mother in law who takes no shit from anybody and whom everyone *fears* lost it on him yelling asking him if that was true and he kept quiet. she started berating him left and right telling him to sit down and shut up when he stood up to argue then told him to stand up when he was sitting arguing. Everyone was laughing at how she basically treated him as if he was a boy in trouble. She kept saying \"Shame shame shame! on you, this is not how I raised my children to treat their wives, Jordan you are a disgrace and I'm disappointed because of what I heard about you\". He literally swallowed every bit of his mother's berating and didn't say anything til we got home where he went nuts saying I made him look neglectful, a bad husband and father by telling the family about where he was and said I shouldn't have said anything but I argued it wasn't okay for him to lie and play hero in front of his parents. He said I just caused a rift between him and family and asked if I was happy now.\n\naita? Should I have not said anything?\n\nEDIT to say that he's done similar things in the past since he's a major enthusiast of football and hockey but I didn't expect it to get to that. Also this is not our first baby together, we have a 4 year old son.",

She text me privately saying we looked like we were having fun, followed by pics of her huge family, and remarked the dinner table was full of family. This is where I maybe the asshole, I replied, lovely!

        "text": "I have three siblings between the ages of 10 and 18. I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.\n\nEvery year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.\n\nI asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.\n\nI thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to! If you'd feel inclined, I think it would be pretty cool to donate it instead to a cool charity of your choice instead.",

I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. \n\nthe next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. \n\nwith Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. \n it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. \n\nAITA?\n\nedit 1 \nI've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.",

        "text": "I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.\n\n\nMy father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\" get out and enjoy their reunion.\n\n\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. \n\n\nWhen my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n\n\nI put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.\n\n\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?",

        "text": "My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.\n\nMy husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )\n\nI would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.\n\nIt's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. \n\nYesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.\n\nToday I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.\n\nTLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.\n\nEdit: to answer questions that people have been asking.\n\nYes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.\n\nYes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.",

        "text": "My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.\n\nI always felt kind of \"different\" from the others because I'm not very \"geeky\" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.\n\nWell, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is \"Harry Potter\" themed.\n\nDue to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.\n\nExcept the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said \"It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.\"\n\nI was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.\n\nI said \"I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.\"\n\nShe was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of \"chasing popularity and doing my nails\" maybe I would have more in common with them.\n\nI'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.\n\n**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were \"too advanced\" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were \"dumb books for vapid little girls.\"\n\n**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? ",

Just a few nights ago she asked me to shave it again for her since she really liked it. I was more than happy to do it.\n\nI do plan on buying her a wig or two off of Amazon before she goes back to school in case she regrets it and wants to wear it to school but take it off at home.\n\nI just want to make it clear - my husband's side of the family (her dad) was fully supportive (after all, her cousin inspired her to do it) I'm also spending less on shampoo and conditioner (she had super long hair)\n\nAs for my side of the family who was upset about it - some of them had a change of heart after she talked to them herself and told them that she was really happy with her decision. The other few think that she was forced to say she was happy, but I don't care.\n\nMy mom, who was the one who forwarded the picture to my family, apologized. She told me she did it because she thought she looked adorable but should have asked me first. But she was supportive of us.\n\nMy daughter wants me to let everyone know that if you really want to shave your head, just do it. According to her, she loves the way it feels on her pillows (she has silk pillowcases) and she liked feeling the shower and rain on her head.",

I left the table and my husband was still eating. as I was making my way back I heard his dad tell him to take it easy because he was eating a lot. he then asked my husband if I cook for him and if he eats well at home. My husband said that I do cook for him but the food I make can only be fed to pigs not humans. I was hurt and so offended. I showed up infront of him and told him I will no longer be cooking for him after this comment. He was turning in his seat as I walked right past him, took my purse and said I was headed home. He got back later saying it wasn't like that and that even if it was then I should be happy he still eats my food when it's still \"not perfect\" yet. He said he was trying to protect my feelings and I hurt him when I said I won't cook anymore.\n\n\nEDIT ~ Hi. I'm sorry I posted this then went out. I only read few comments and felt hasitant to respond but now I'm overwhelmed.

They're both on great terms and I have to say her parents are a bit much.\n\n\nSo the engagement party was held at a restaurant. I drove my wife, Rowan snd his best friend Jack there because Rowan's car needed some work. Things went quite well, party ended and everyone went home.\n\n\nOn the way back, I had to stop by the store so my could grab something for our 16 year old son. Rowan, Jack and I waited in the car. Rowan and Jack kept laughing then this young lady walked towards us cause her car was parked next to mine in the parking lot. Rowan kept trying to speak to her while she was trying to load her stuff in the car. he and jack kept throwing words at her and she sermed annoyed. Jack then said \"hey, he just wants to look at that a**\" then Rowan said \"Let me see it jiggle, baby\" I was appalled, I told them both to knock it off but then Rowan satcastically replied \"Relax I was just giving her a compliment, bet she don't get many of those often\". The lady got in her car and I started arguing with him about his behavior and shamed him for acting like this on his own engagement night. He argued back saying something about my car and I lost it. I told him to get out immediately, Jack got involved so I kicked him out too. My wife got back and started engaging in the argument sayingI can't let her son walk home from his emgagement party, I replied that her son can't be harrassing other women on the way back from his engagement party but she kept defending him. I told her to either stay or get in the car. She did and I drove off.\n\n\nRowan didn't come home and my wife gave me hell for it. we later found out that he was staying at one of his guy friends place. From what I understand, he's pissed at me and refusing to see me. My wife said it was my fault, I escalated the situation ober some stupid shit boys his age do all the time. I told her he can't do this while in my car but she took it as in I was holding it over his head. She said I should've never made him walk the night his engagement and demanded that I apologize to him.\n\n\nwas I AITA for kicking him and his friend out of the car on his engagement night?",

I flew into town and my parents insisted that I stay with them instead of a hotel like I wanted.  \n\nMy parents are consistently late for everything.  I think it's a Latin thing.  I hate being late.  I think it's disrespectful.  \n\nThe wedding was at 2:30.  My folks live about half an hour from the church.  \n\nNoon rolls up and my folks aren't even getting ready yet.  \n\nThey are adults and I am over dealing with them. \n\nI get ready. I send for an Uber and I am at the church for 2:00. \n\nI check in with my sister.  She asks me if I had any problems getting my parents to church. I told her that I came by myself.  Shebw my white and said that I was responsible for getting them there on time.  \n\nWell nobody asked me to do that.  I didn't even want to stay there.  \n\nSo now everyone starts calling my parents.  They are getting ready.  \n\nThey were about 35 minutes late.  \n\nThe service was shortened because there was another wedding later that day.  \n\nEveryone is still mad at me for not getting my parents there on time.  My aunt said that I'm an asshole for messing up the timing of the wedding. \n\nMy mom says it's my fault for not reminding them to get ready.  \n\nAm I the only one who thinks adults should be able to be on time for their own kid's wedding without help?",

        "text": "\nMy brother Jake (18M) and I (17F) had the same dream college, H University. Also, in case you\u2019re confused by the ages, we\u2019re 1.5 years apart, but I skipped a grade so we were in the same grade for nearly our entire life. Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he\u2019d say things like \u201cOnce I\u2019m at H....\u201d or \u201cAfter I go to H, my plan is...\u201d. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. \n\nJake and I got along pretty well, we\u2019d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He\u2019d refuse to study together, look over each other\u2019s essays, and he\u2019d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. \n\nThen, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. \n\nI once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for \u201cshowing off\u201d, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. \n\nHonestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it\u2019d get better after the summer, once college actually started. \n\nIt has not. Now it\u2019s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he\u2019s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. \n\nMy classes start soon, so I\u2019ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We\u2019ve always both worn headphones, there\u2019s literally no distraction. He just doesn\u2019t want to see me taking classes at H. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking done, I just want to be proud that I got into this college and actually learn shit without my brother screaming at me about it. \n\nWhere IMBTA: We got into an argument, and  I told him that of course he got rejected since H didn\u2019t take toddlers. I\u2019ve also been wearing my H sweatshirt around the house constantly, which he gets angry about. He kept bothering me, so I superglued H rejection letters in the drawers of his desk, so he has to see them when he opens them.",

        "text": "Hi Reddit. So I said in my original post that I might update and well, here it is.\n\nOriginal Post -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iocvnp/aita\\_for\\_wearing\\_my\\_gfs\\_hoodie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iocvnp/aita_for_wearing_my_gfs_hoodie/)\n\nSo this actually happened a week or two after my original post but we've had a few unrelated family issues going on and I haven't been able to post.\n\nLike a few of you suggested, I did wear my gf's clothes at the next gathering. Nothing major, just some cute high heeled boots, her pink sweater and a pair of her jeans. She also painted my nails a beautiful shade of pink and helped style my hair. Let's just say, by the end of it I wasn't looking like a stereotypical \"manly man\". Not that there's anything wrong with people that do like more masculine clothes. My gf had also decided to wear jeans and a button up shirt (just to annoy SIL).\n\nAnyways, we went to my parents and immediately got glares and rude comments from SIL. The comments started about how \"if I want to be the woman in a relationship so bad then I should just go back to being a f\\*g\" etc. There were a bunch of comments before this but she got annoyed when we ignored them in favour of having an intelligent conversation with other family members.\n\nThat was the comment that really got to my parents though, it was partly the comment and partly the fact that my brother didn't do anything other than laugh. I've told them to stay out of it as my brother has a history of stopping their contact with my nephew over stupid things and they have enough to worry about. I'd bullied a bit in the past for my sexuality and my brother never stood by me. To him it was my own fault, if I didn't want to be bullied then I should've stayed in the closet.\n\nMy parents freaked out and all the anger and resentment towards my SIL that they had built up for the past few years came pouring out. They told her how they really felt about her and how they are disgusted that my brother could allow someone to treat his own brother like crap.They told them to leave and SIL is no longer welcome in their home until she apologises. My brother tried the threat of preventing them from seeing their grandson but they were done with him and threatened to get a lawyer involved. They now have scheduled visits (though now it's video calls as the rules are more tight again). I feel bad that they're no longer talking to my brother but they've assured me that they'll be okay.\n\nHonestly this turned into my parents being badasses rather than myself or gf doing much (other than looking absolutely fabulous). Either way, I'm glad that we won't have to see her for a long while. We blocked her everywhere after this incident due to the angry messages/voicemails we were getting. I know this probably isn't the update a lot of people were hoping for but it's brought my family some peace of mind and I'm happy with that.\n\nEdit - Okay holy crap this blew up. Seriously thank you for all the amazing comments and awards. I've been trying to read all the comments, sorry that I can't reply to them all.\n\nI've seen a lot of people asking about my nephews visits with my parents. It was not done through a court. It is literally just a plan that my parents and brother came up with so that they can have regular contact with my nephew without speak to his parents. As for the lawyer question. Honestly I do not know everything about how it works, I'm going off what my parents have told me. \n\nWe live in Scotland and technically grandparents don't have automatic legal rights to their grandkids. They can, however, get a lawyer involved and the courts can decide if contact with grandparents is best for the child. Due to the fact that my nephew is a bit older now there is a good chance they could take his opinion into account. \n\nI hope this sort of cleared this up for you guys.",

        "text": "Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. \n\nI\u2019ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she\u2019s been mine ever since. She\u2019s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.\n\nWhen I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. \n\nAt first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I\u2019m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he\u2019ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn\u2019t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I\u2019m always rushing around her.\n\nThen last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I\u2019ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she\u2019s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn\u2019t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. \n\nSo I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I\u2019m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful \u2764\ufe0f\n\n[Update here](https://www.reddit.com/user/nohorsethrow/comments/snfhxm/update_aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_horse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

We have a 2 year old and I'm 6 months pregnant.\n\n\nThis whole drama started days ago. My husband has a large family. And on every Christmas they'd gather at his father's house. My father in law passed away a year ago and This year my husband decided as the man of the family to host Christmas at our house. Unbeknowest to me, he sent out invitations for a 5 day Christmas celebration to his entire family which are about 26 members in total.\nI found out about by accident and I was too shocked to react. I confronted him on it and he said I shouldn't be surprised and just get used to it because after his father's death he's now the family's \"head\" and all major family events will be held in our house and in his presence. I freaked out and said no this is wrong and he should've talked to me first before sending out any invitations to his family knowing I have other commitments like work and taking care of the house and our son. He said we'll manage if I took time off work but that means more workload later and it'd take away from my maternity leave. I demanded he cancel the invitations but he refused saying \"over my dead body\" then walked out. I ended up sending a mass text to everyone who recieved an invitation explaining that we will not be hosting Christmas this year. He found out and went off on me calling my behabior outragously appalling and said that I  broke his word to his family and made him look small and with no authority. I in a very strict tone replied that I didn't sign up to host a celebration and accomadate 26 people while pregnant, taking care of a toddler and working. And I don't care if he became the head of family after his father's death because it means nothing to me. He took offense to that and walked out almost crying.\n\n\nHe later talked about how I disrespected his father and him with what I said and demanded a hand written apology for cancelling the event and for being insensitive towards him and underminning his authority infront of his family but I said no apology from me in any form and the issue is still up especially with my MIL giving me a stern talk about how out of line I was for disrespecting my husband's decisions regarding the holiday celebration with family.\n\ntldr: my husband invited his family without telling me so I cancelled and he wants a formal apology.\n\n\nETA to put this out there he planned on sitting and telling stories of his dad while I handle everything and his family believe that as guests it's rude to ask them to help.",

        "text": "My husband and I had our wedding last year. The venue was beautiful and bordered a lake. Unfortunately, during the reception, one of the young children snuck away from their parents and decided to...go for a swim, despite not being able to. This was tragic and devasting, and obviously cut the day short. \n\nWe haven't really spoken to the parents since then, as we weren't close to them aside from seeing them on holidays, which haven't happened this year. We are still Facebook friends though. When our first anniversary came, I made a post celebrating our anniversary with a few wedding photos. I didn't think anything of it, until the comments came flooding in. I woke up to 30 comments and 15 missed calls. The top comment was from the mother of the child, who was outraged about it. \n\nShe wrote a very long comment about how my post was disrespectful of the tragedy that had happened that day and how dare I post that and not mention her child (and of course talking to her first). 30 comments later, and it was clear that the entire family had clearly started to take sides in a battle I didn't realize I created. As of today, we're at 150 comments. My friends and my parents are involved too.\n\nHalf of his family is screaming for me to take it down, apologize to the parents, and show more respect, possibly by even celebrating our anniversary on a different day. Some of the family think that we should still be able to celebrate our anniversary on the actual day, but just keep it offline to \"keep peace\". I don't think I did anything wrong with my post, and I feel like we should be allowed to celebrate our anniversary just like anyone else. I'm not celebrating the tragedy, I'm celebrating my wedding. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI have changed the post to only be visible to me and deleted all comments to try to stop the arguing, but from the email we just received, those comments were just a symptom of a larger problem. \n\nMy mother in law sent us an email with, from what I can tell, roughly 3/4 of my husband's family cc'd on it. His parents, grandparents, and the parents of the child are not only in the \"different day\" camp, but they are also demanding a **second wedding**. According to them, they've \"kept their silence\" for so long due to shock and being distracted by everything else going on this year, but they feel that \"because of what happened\" we aren't \"really married\" yet in the family.\n\nThey \"understand that weddings are expensive\" so they [husband's parents] offered to completely pay for this second wedding that will be the \"real\" wedding in his family's eyes, and because it may be a year or two before this can be done safely, they will \"tolerate\" us \"living in sin\" indefinitely due to \"the circumstances\".\n\nMy husband hates arguing with his family, and I'm not sure how I would even approach this with my family without being laughed out of the room, so now we need to talk about what to do with this.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nI've never had this many calls in my life. My husband and I have tried to read through this and have gotten a chance to actually talk this out. We have avoided the subject for a long time because it is not an easy thing to think about and it is not like this year hasn't had stresses of its own. He agrees that while something does need to happen, it is a priority that they start and continue to acknowledge that we are in fact married. I have had a conversation with my parents at least, who were exactly as they always were, but they are now aware of the full situation, and while they still would not support a full second wedding, they understand that I have an exceptional situation and so something exceptional needs to happen. I replied to my MIL ONLY to a group zoom call with us, my parents, my husband's sister in law to set up that sets up all of their technology things, which will happen later in the day. \n\nI feel like I should address some things: \n\n1. I did send condolences and attended the funeral. By not speaking, I meant since the funeral. I mistakenly thought that would be implied. \n\n2. I am not heartless. I was trying to avoid the rules with the euphemism, and it is not an easy day or thing to talk about. I was trying to keep things to just what happened, which I can see coming across very strange over text. I am also aware that I write very formally but that's not something I can change. \n\n3. The pictures and caption didn't reference the wedding itself, and there is no lake visible in the pictures. I only used ones that had just my husband and I in them, and I have sent pictures of just the bridal party before. I never have or will post pictures of the reception.\n\n4. My husband and I are looking ideas of how to fix this.",

        "text": "**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY \"I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...**\n\nYears ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love.\n\nMy niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting. \n\nI had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off.\n\nThey agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts.\n\nWell I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones.\n\nMy prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron.\n\nThe worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized. \n\nI basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS\n\nSIL got between us and said \"what's done is done\n\n**im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!**\n\nI said no way, you're returning EVERYTHING\nJenny said \"Mom already sold most of them on marketplace\"\nI lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.\nHe brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.\nI told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.\nSo AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",

I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home. \n\nRecently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office.\n\n\nLast week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually. \n\nI got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.",

His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.\n\nHe suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",

When it came to me, Tom said \u201cOh, well we know what your greatest accomplishment is, obviously. You have three beautiful, well-behaved children.\u201d\n\nI was honestly shocked, and I said no, that\u2019s NOT my greatest accomplishment.

You have kids, why didn\u2019t you say that?\u201d\n\nHe said how he didn\u2019t *birth* the kids, and how that\u2019s a miracle of life and all that gag-me shit. I just rolled my eyes and said \u201cLet\u2019s not boil women down to their biological functions, kay?\u201d\n\nJen, who has kids, chimed in and said \u201cWell, my kids are my greatest accomplishment. I can\u2019t imagine thinking anything else.\u201d\n\nTom looked super smug, others including other moms chimed in. All of the moms agreed their kids were their greatest accomplishment.\n\nI kind of stewed about it. After that, the woman who chimed in sent me a message asking me if I needed to talk to someone, and asked if I was depressed, because my statement was worrisome. She ended up reaching out to my husband to encourage me to get help, because it seems I\u2019m unhappy being a mom and that puts my kids at risk.\n\nAm I really the asshole here for thinking being a Mom isn\u2019t the end all be all of my life?

        "text": "**Edit: Whoa, I didn't expect this post to get huge. Thanks for all the feedback & opinions, everyone (even the ones who think this is fake. I sincerely hope you never meet someone like Anna in your life).** \n\n**Just some clarifications to clear the air:**\n\n1. **Why did I write this post? I've faced many Anna's in my life, but my comments about how its inappropriate has always been shut down (i.e., you're too sensitive/ they're just trying to be nice/ you're not being welcoming) by others (in other similar situations). It's confusing/ distressing, but I feel like Anna really hit my limit & I wanted to make sure that I'm not TA**\n2. **Is Anna white? She's of mixed heritage (Caucasian & African American). I personally feel like it added another sensitive layer in this entire mix & indirectly goes back to the point above**\n3. **Did I talk to her about this entire thing? I moved out of SEA to get rid of that 'you're not Chinese enough' mentality (I faced that from my own countrymen multiple times) & I don't celebrate Lunar New Year (thanks to those who recommended that term) outside of my home country for personal reasons (my family sucks & I don't have good memories attached to that holiday). I didn't think I would need to justify/ defend myself** ***again.*** **As for the separate incidences, not really (& that's my fault). I just told her don't do that again cause I don't like it. I should have explained to her why, & I accept responsibility for that**\n4. **How did she confuse kabuki masks & think hell notes were decoration? Based on what her bf said, she went to some Chinese website that sells everything & the translation was whacky so she just thought it was all the same**\n5. **The entire organ meat incident: she didn't expect me & SO to eat them raw. She expected SO & I to cook it cause she's seen me cook some herbal soups before (non had organ meat though)**\n\n**Hope that clarifies things for everyone!**\n\nHusband (28M) & I (25F) are ethnically Chinese from a SEA country living overseas. We rent a house with SO's college friend who moved his gf (Anna) in during lockdown & she's been with us ever since (with landlord's permission & she pays her share of bills). They're not Asians, which matters.\n\nAnna was initially nice, but started acting very weirdly a month after she moved in:\n\n1. Telling SO & I that we can practice our 'real' religion (which apparently is Buddhism, not Christianity even though SO & I come from Christian families). She even bought incense (which gives me migraines) & a random Buddha statue. We politely explained to her that we're not Buddhists, but she continued to insist & promised that she didn't mind.\n2. Telling SO & I that we can speak our 'real' language cause she overheard SO's family talking to us in a mix of English & Cantonese. I explained to her that I can't speak Cantonese (SO can) even though I can understand it. She was, for some reason, really disappointed in me & said that I was throwing my heritage away. Plot twist: my own father is only comfortable speaking English.\n3. Buying raw internal organs for SO & I to cook, even though we don't eat those. I told her we don't eat that (not our thing), & she was again disappointed. She told us she read that there were lots of nice recipes & maybe we haven't found the right one to remind us of home. SO told her he's never eaten it ever in his life, & I've never liked it. She was really upset, but had to toss it since no one was gonna eat it\n\nChinese New Year was when things got really really weird. She started ordering 'decorations'. I wouldn't mind, but she had ordered hell notes (the ones burned for deceased ancestors). I immediately told her to stop pasting them all over the walls because they were weirding me out. She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down. She got upset (again), but then ordered kabuki masks. I told her that those masks were not Chinese, & she just snapped. She started yelling at me that I should be helping her & not critiquing what she was doing. I told her:\n\n1. She never asked\n2. CNY is not a big deal to me, so I wasn't planning on decorating but if she had asked, I would have helped\n3. She never asked\n\nI told her I don't understand her fixation with us. She said she wanted to surprise me & SO, that we've been so 'colonised' we've forgotten our roots, & that we should be embracing our culture. I told her it was a nice gesture, but she needs to stop forcing stereotypes down our throats. She could have just asked & she's not being woke when she's getting everything wrong.\n\nShe burst into tears & brought in her bf. He understood where I was coming from, but thought I could have been nicer. SO stands by me, & now things have been tense, but I've been tolerating this for a while now & it was getting on my nerves.",

        "text": "Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?\n\nTHIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.\n\nINFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. \n\nAs for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her \"stuff\".  She already has \"stuff\".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with \"stuff\".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.\n\nUpdate for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.\n\nUpdate for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to \"retire\" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week \"preschool\" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and \"bless\" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.\n\nLastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  \n\nI still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.\n\n\nUPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough \"things\" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on \"giving\" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a \"new tradition\" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.\n\nTo those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and \"not bothered to budget for it once it came\" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",

I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.\n\nAnyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel.

He says that he was just trying to see if I could leave the same signature everytime I sign but I couldn't help feel uncomfortable. I told him I don't want to play this game unless and until he shows me the papers first, he said \"nevermind then\" and stopped bringing it up.\n\n\nLast night, he tried to convince me to give it a try and even volunteered to go first, I asked if he was going to show me what I was going to sign and he made a face and said no, it's the rules and I should respect them. I refused and he kept on about how I keep acting worried and suspicious for no reason. he said I clearly don't trust him and he was hurt by finding that out now after everything we been through. We had an argument and I told him to drop it and not bring it up again, period. He was mad despite saying it was no big deal, he was obviously upset with me and kept talking about how I don't trust him and that I was out of line to assume or suspect anything from him like this. I might be paranoid but I couldn't help it. I do think I was ta to him after he stood by my side when my own family didn't even visit.",

Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have Candy Crush on her phone.\n\nSo I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it).\n\nAfter dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than \"I'm sorry you're right\" people will say \"Accept your judgment!\" and if I reply \"Thanks\" to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation.\n\nShout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote:\n\nLooks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies. Stop being bitter and leave her alone. You don\u2019t need to also be mean to stay single af as you already are. Lol \n\nGirl thanks for your attention glad to know you're so interested in my life you have to try to talk to me through multiple channels.",

        "text": "My husband is an avid computer gamer - mostly WoW-type games. Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.\n\nA few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.\n\nIt dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different? AITA?",

The first time I sprayed him with the hose he ran off, but then for some reason he just started standing there while I hose him like he enjoys it.\n\nIts now progressed to me sitting on my lawn chair pointing my hose at him, and him just staring at me while he does so. Sometimes we even make small talk.\n\nIm ngl, it started off as a really bitter relationship, but Ive actually gotten to know the kid quite well, we talk for maybe 15-20 mins everyday, and he doesnt seem to mind being hosed down after sweating hard playing soccer.\n\nHe comes by daily and we just shoot the shit while I hose him and he stands there for a bit.\n\nWife told me I need to stop, even after I explained it to her she said Im making us look like childish idiots.\n\nI guess I could stop, but honestly its really funny waiting for him to come by and I see no harm in it.

Since many of you requested an update, here we go.\n\nTurns out some of you were right, my wife was in on it. I confronted her a couple days after I posted and directly asked her if she knew that her parents planned this. She broke down and confessed everything to me. MIL had been pestering her about baptizing our son nonstop and my wife finally caved. My wife has been working from home during covid while my job requires me to go into the office. My wife and MIL started doing zoom meetings with MIL's priest to start the baptism process. They lied to the priest and told him that I was ok with baptizing our son but didn't want to be involved. The priest allowed it and they started doing online baptism classes while I was at work.\n\nMy wife admitted that she planned it around our anniversary getaway and that MIL had somehow convinced the priest that her and FIL would be the only ones in attendance. My wife told me that I wasn't supposed to find out, but MIL couldn't keep her mouth shut for even one day about it. Their intention was to keep this from me permanently.\n\nI did contact the church to let them know the truth. I talked with the priest and he was surprisingly helpful. He said he would take the proper steps to make sure MIL is no longer welcome in their church and to reach out to the local parish to see what further steps need to be taken. I have yet to hear back from them on that. My wife and MIL are mad that I got her kicked out of her church, but I don't care what they think or feel anymore.\n\nThese people who I love and trust had betrayed me and I felt a range emotions I didn't know existed. My wife begged for forgiveness, but the fact that she didn't come clean on her own makes me feel she would have kept this from me unless I confronted her. She's willing to do therapy, counseling, whatever it takes. I don't know if I want to put in that work, I feel like there's no coming back from this.\n\nI contacted a divorce lawyer and started discussing what a divorce would look like and if there is any way I can add provisions to a divorce agreement that would keep my inlaws from seeing my son unsupervised. He's been very helpful but I have not given him the go-ahead to actually file for divorce yet. I feel I am still too angry about the entire thing to think rationally and want to give myself time to fully grasp what a divorce will mean for me and my family.\n\nMy wife and I aren't talking much. I pretty much go to work, come home to play with my son, go to bed, and repeat. I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I do know that without the support and help from people here, I don't think I would have the clarity I do now.",

        "text": "WIBTA for not attending my twin brothers surprise birthday dinner when I am only invited as a guest \n\n\nWould I be the asshole for not attending a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother \n\nSo I\u2019m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we\u2019re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together. \n\nNow, I have been added to a group chat labeled \u201c*my brothers name* surprise dinner!\u201d It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would \u201cbe nice to see me as well\u201d so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn\u2019t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I\u2019s closest friends.\n\nThis feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can\u2019t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn\u2019t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it. \n\nIn the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it\u2019s just a celebration for \u201chis\u201d birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn\u2019t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at a crossroads. I don\u2019t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don\u2019t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn\u2019t go?\n\nEDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we *really* aren\u2019t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also. \n\nThanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out\n\n(Edit: I have posted an update to my profile as my character count was too long)\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/_somethingorrather/comments/1367ffb/update_wibta_for_not_attending_my_twin_brothers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)",

I\u2019m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I\u2019ve never been able to get a loan I\u2019ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I\u2019ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I\u2019m there or when I\u2019m not. Since I\u2019ve been saving for this semester he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s been over I\u2019ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it\u2019s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn\u2019t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn\u2019t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I\u2019m yelling at him about my money he\u2019s acting all confused and like I\u2019m crazy. He comes over I\u2019m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he\u2019ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it\u2019s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They\u2019ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it\u2019s stressing me out even more and I hate that I\u2019m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I\u2019ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they\u2019ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don\u2019t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don\u2019t know what to do and I hate that I\u2019m contemplating doing this. I\u2019m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.",

Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being \"wasteful\" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space.

My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a \"compromise\". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her she had lost her mind and hung up. \n\nAm I the asshole, or is she?

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like \"I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago\" \"They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park\". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.\n\nOne of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.\n \nNow yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.\n\nMy boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",

        "text": "To start me and my mother in law have never gotten along. She hates my guts and can be oversensitive often times. I tried not to give her the wrong impression about me but we just don't like each other.\n\nSunday, I was feeling sick (I'm a new mom btw) and couldn't eat what she cooked for dinner and she seemeed to take it personal. She sent me a private message of what seemed to be her final straw with my behavior and it stated the following: copy/paste\n\n\"Oh yes I know and feel your passive aggressive vibe. You keep pretending to be sick so you won't have to eat what I cook? What? You think my cooking is disgusting? You think I'm unhigynec? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR? Apologies I forgot you're a new mom and can't be bothered to even get your hair brushed. You finally trapped our son and now want to use the baby as a pawn.I don\u2019t like the fact you're my grandchild's mother. I don\u2019t think I'll ever come to terms with it because you bore him. But I\u2019ll pretend. Pretend I don\u2019t know my son's been having chats with his ex every chance he gets. Be mean to his mommy. Me. And you\u2019ll see how far that gets you. Oh and when I watch your shitbeast dog it stays chained to a garage day and night until a half hour before you arrive. It stinks up my house you know same with your hair and clothes\". My mind was blown and my gut reaction was to immediately go to my husband and show him what his mom sent and he didn't take it well. He tried calling her but she didn't respond. It was 11pm and he decided to drive to his parents house and pick a fight with her about the text. According to my sister in law #1 who witnessed it he yelled at his mother and berated her and caller her names then disowned her which shocked everyone in the house. My mother in law is diabetic she fainted on the spot and my husband didn't stop he just walked out of there while his family were yelling at him. I got several calls and texts from them claiming I just caused irreparable damage in my husband's relationship with his mother, jeopardized her health because she was taken to the hospital and worsthe of all making my husband disown her over what? A dinner that i could've gotten a few bites of? A simple misunderstanding? They accused me of causing this shitshow and turning my husband on his own mother and disowning her like that. Sister in law #3 berated me for sharing the text with my husband saying I should've confronted my mother in law alone instead of escalating the situation. She said I'm responsible for whatever happens next and have to fix the problem I created.\n\nI feel awful overall and so guilty since she's at the hospital and the family are feeling tense. My husband is avoiding me.AITA?",

        "text": "Thowaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nImportant info:\n\n- I'm a caucasian F, early 30's. Married to a lovely mixed M and we have a 2yr old.\n\n- I've cut contact with my family about 5yrs ago, mostly due to my mother's narcissistic behaviour and her being pretty darn racist (she hated me dating my now husband), and the rest of my family condoning the crap she put us up with. \n\n- Most of my other relatives cut ties withwith my family before I was born or shortly after, I'm thinking it's once again because of my mother. The only one that kept in touch was one aunt, from my father's side.\n\nThis happened yesterday.\n\n\nLast friday I got a call from my aunt that my dad got into an accident 2 days prior and didn't make it (he died on impact apparently). She asked me if I'd heard anything from my family, to which I replied 'no' (important to know that I've been using the same cellphone number and email since I was 18 or so). She figured they forgot and asked me if I wanted to come to the funeral. After a few minutes of thinking I told her I'd come if my family was okay with it and if SHE wanted me to, I explained to her that I wouldn't be going for myself or my father/family, just to support her. She said she'd want me there as she'd have no other support and called me later to tell me my family was okay with me coming.\n\nSo, yesterday was the day of the funeral. The past few days I did not hear a single thing from my family. When I got to the location my family members jumped right on top of me, telling me how happy they were that I came/that we should go to dinner/told me all kinds of stories about thing that happened the last 5yrs........they basically acted like those 5yrs didn't happed and we weren't there for a funeral. I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.\nDuring the ceremony they insisted I sat next to my mother. Everything started out okay, but when it was time for speeches, my family insisted I'd speak. I quietly told them no, that I had nothing prepared, but they didn't accept it. So I got up and quickly said 'he'll be missed' and sat down again. They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.\n\nSo, I looked at her for a few seconds, mostly trying to figure out wth just happened..........stood up, told her to enjoy the rest of her day and walked out.\n\nMy husband told me I did the right thing and he was proud of me for keeping my cool instead of starting a shouting match, so is my aunt........but I've been bombarded with messages from people that say I went too far.

        "text": "This happened during this weekend, me being in my early thirties and my gf in her late twenties. I was invited to a wedding ceremony of a colleague and could bring someone with me. I asked my GF that I've been dating for a year if she would like to join me and she was really happy because she apparently loves weddings. Since we don't live together I drove to pick her up so we'd have some time to spare before the ceremony.\n\nAs she comes out she looks really beautiful and has obviously put in time to fix her hair and make-up. She's also wearing an off-white dress that was rather ornate. As she got in I told her that she looked stunning, but I asked if she could change to a different colored dress for the ceremony. I'm not one for etiquette by far, but one of the few things I have heard everywhere is that you should not wear a white dress to a wedding unless you're the bride. She became pretty upset and wanted to know what was wrong with her dress. I said that it would be inappropriate to wear a white or off-white dress unless you're the bride - and that it's like wedding-law or something, trying to be lighthearted about it. She rolled her eyes and said that it was an outdated tradition about women and virginity and that when her friends got married everyone wore white and that it's not a big thing anymore.\n\nI told her that I don't know what the dress code is for this ceremony, but since it's not saying \"all white clothes\" I still thought she should change to another color but white or \"almost-white\" - because my colleague was getting married and we had no idea how she felt about it. My gf became really upset and told me that I was trying to control what she was wearing and that it was abusive, which honestly made me really upset and hurt. I said something along the lines of \"Fuck, well you shouldn't go to a wedding with an abuser then\" and then I told her to fuck off out of my car. She began to cry and wanted to apologize and give me a hug, but I just told her to get out, which she did (EDIT: To clarify we never left the driveway by her home, I did not drop her off in the middle of nowhere or anything like that).\n    \nI drove off and she called and texted me a bunch. I answered \"I don't want to talk right now\" and then turned my phone off and attended the ceremony. The bride was the only one that was wearing white so I feel as if my gut feeling was the right one. When I got home my phone had blown up by texts from her and her best friend saying that I was being inconsiderate and controlling and should apologize for my behavior. I've vented to a few friends - most of them agreeing with me but some have said that it was an asshole thing to tell her that she could not wear her dress - because it had nothing to do with me. I feel as if I was in the right since it was my colleagues wedding and it was better to be safe than sorry, but I'm also not sure if I was being an asshole about the situation. So, reddit AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: I never expected this thread to get this many replies. I am incredibly thankful for all of you that have reached out and commented, and I really really appreciate that you've taken the time to tell me. My GF found out about the thread (don't know if she knew my handle, or just found it) and we talked over the phone. She apologized and I apologized and it was a pretty good talk. She asked if she could come over, and I said no and that it would be best for us to go our separate ways. She got upset and asked why I wouldn't even try to work it out. I basically just said good bye and then she said my dick was small which actually made me laugh after what had been a pretty mature conversation and then she hung up. I'm pretty sad about it, she really made me feel happy but as many of you have commented - if this was our first disagreement and she called me abusive how would future disagreements look? I was hurt, but if she did think I was being abusive, it would be the right thing to do, and if she did not think I was being abusive and said it anyways I would not want to be with her. So anyways I think things worked out for the best for us both. Again thank you all, and I will keep trying to respond to all of you, but there are a lot off messages but I read through them all!",

We got married! \n\nI realized pretty quickly after posting my original post that I was the asshole and my feelings were hurt because I\u2019m an idiot. So we picked out a ring together, and in that we decided, hey, let\u2019s just elope! So we both picked out a ring, and now we\u2019re married. \n\nThank you for everyone who tried to knock some sense into me. I am very happy with my wife, and I\u2019m glad we both got what we wanted.\n\n\nShe also wore the amulet as we got married, but she didn\u2019t want me to post any of our actual wedding photos on the internet so I\u2019m just posting the rings.\n\nThat\u2019s it, we\u2019re happy, a ring was bought and now we\u2019re just enjoying nerdy married life.\n\nEdit: I removed the photo of our rings. I will not have people insult my wife. She is a ridiculously beautiful woman, but that isn\u2019t the most important thing. She is compassionate and smart as hell. She\u2019s the funniest person I know, and has such quick wit she\u2019ll put you on your ass laughing. \n\nBut you people can\u2019t get passed her (I think adorable) hands, so no more photos. Sorry.\n\nFinal edit: I\u2019m not sure if this is allowed, and if not I\u2019m very sorry but my wife created a discord server for people who genuinely just want to see the rings, so message me if interested I suppose.",

        "text": "My (37f) husband (40m) has been working at his company for 10 years as a maintenance supervisor. About a year ago they hired Tabitha\\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.\n\nThis started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. \n\nLast year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said \"look there's Peter,\" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. \n\nThe past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. \n\nI told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. \n\nHe said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. \n\nHe says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.\n\nAITA?",

I didn't think much of it, but she came back exactly 3 hours later after both of them finished looking sad. Today the same thing happened and when I went to wake her up for dinner today I found her watching a recording of my daughter\u2019s session. I lost it. That conversation was supposed I will be private we had promised our kids that we will respect their privacy and do our best to help them when they need it.\n\nI made her confess to our kids and told her. They were heartbroken and they hate her. She claims that it\u2019s my fault but she dug her own grave. \n\nBoth of them feel betrayed and don't want anything to do with their mother. So Reddit am I the asshole for forcing a confession??\n\nEdit: Thank you for the Platinum award stranger\n\nEdit2: Thank you for the Silver award stranger\nI really do appreciate both of them\n\nEdit3: Thank you guys for the overwhelming support. I really do love this subreddit.\n\nEdit4: Thank you for the gold kind stranger\n\nEdit5: For the people wondering about her intention for spying on the kids. She hasn\u2019t said a word about it. Just got up and left saying that \u201cI don\u2019t need to take this shit\u201d\n\nMinor update:\n\nHey so many of you wanted an update, but it\u2019s too soon to tell what will actually happen.\nAs of now my soon to be ex-wife is staying at a friends house. I did receive some calls from her and her friends about how I\u2019m an asshole but after I explained everything to her friends they apologised and sided with me.\n\nMy kids do want a divorce but I feel as tho she has already put that plan into motion. I\u2019m not too worry as I am able to afford better lawyers than her. My kids are actually grateful that I did what I did because they now realised that their mom is a control freak. Funny enough a friend had found the post after a mutual friend told them and showed it to my wife.\n\nSorry if this is short, but this is all I have as of right now.",

My husband Ryan hates them, he never truely gave a reason other than just say...he doesn't feel comfortable with *me* using *them* . I didn't think it was a big deal at first since he said he hates a lot of stuff that I do but \"puts up\" with it anyway except for this. He asked that I go back to using pads but I made it clear since it's my body then I get to decide.\n\n\nHe threw away some tampons he had access to, and I was getting upset but*!!!!* to keep the peace, I just bought a box and hid it away from him. he somehow found it and threw it away. I didn't find that out til I had my period yesterday and realized I had no tampons to use. I was tired, and too stressed I just yelled at him after he admitted to throwing away the whole box. He argued that I already knew how he felt about *this stuff* and yet I decided to still *keep it around*. I lost it and told him he had no right to do this and told him to get over himself already. He stared at me almost about to tear up or something, then walked out.\n\n\nHe later went on about how we, as a couple should take each other's discomfert into consuderation and said he already tried to speak to me about those tampons yet I brushed him off and insulted him and verbally abused him. He also said that if I still insist on using them then I should do it while I'm outside the house but I said that it won't happen. I feel bad for how it played out but I was just at my wet's end and in so much pain I lashed out.\n\n\nDid I go too far here? Does he have a valid point or not?",

I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. \n\nSo for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said \"I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.\"\n\nA few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.",

I am overjoyed as I have always wanted a child of my own. I focused on my career in my life and since I am single, I wasn\u2019t sure if having a baby would ever happen.\n\nI was excited to tell my family the big news. My older sister has one child, my nephew (7m). My brother is married but he and his wife have made it very clear they will always be child free.\n\nLast night we had a family dinner and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to share the news. Since this will be my only child I wanted to make it special and I also wanted to involve my nephew.\n\nI got a shirt that read \u201cthis is what an awesome big cousin looks like\u201d. I slipped away with my nephew before dinner and had a special moment with him while I told him he was going to have a cousin. \n\nMy nephew was very excited and put on the shirt. He put his sweater on over it and I told him he could take the sweater off whenever he wanted at dinner.\n\nIn the middle of dinner he took off the sweater and waited for someone to notice. Soon my sister jumped up and excitedly screamed when she saw the shirt.\n\nThey all then immediately assumed it was my sister in law. I wasn\u2019t hurt my them assuming this and I kind of expected it because she is married.\n\nI was hurt because my sister in law didn\u2019t try to correct them. She just went along with it and began to rub her flat belly while laughing. I must have looked completely hurt because my mother yelled at me to stop being rude and to congratulate them.\n\nI tried to explain that I was the one who gave my nephew the shirt. They all didn\u2019t even hear me and just continued to fawn over my sister in law. My brother stood frozen in shock just asking his wife if she was serious.\n\nI got up and went home. I received multiple texts at this point from them telling me what an asshole I am for making this about me. They said things like it wasn\u2019t my sister in laws fault that I was jealous. I didn\u2019t reply to anything and just cried myself to sleep.\n\nThis morning my sister in law must have finally let it slip that she is not pregnant. They have now all called me to apologize saying that they just got caught up in the moment.\n\nThey said I shouldn\u2019t have left the dinner and that it\u2019s my fault I wasn\u2019t clear enough that I was the one who is pregnant. My mom said I could have a redo dinner so I can get it right and they will all act surprised. \n\nMy sister in law sent me a message that said that the way I chose to announce was how she wanted to do it if she ever got pregnant. She said that since she is not ever having a child that she just wanted to experience what the moment would be like. She also said I can have my chance at the redo dinner. \n\nI told them no and that I will not be doing a redo. Every single person has now told me I am being selfish and an asshole because I won\u2019t let them make it right.\n\nTo me there\u2019s no fixing this. I will eventually forgive them but I don\u2019t want to do a second announcement so they feel better.\n\nAITA?",

I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fianc\u00e9 and their friends harassing me about it. There\u2019s 4 months left on the lease so I\u2019m just going to ignore them but when I spoke to my mom about it she thinks I should let them have the apartment since they need to start saving for their wedding.",

        "text": "So my wife (26F) and I (28M) have been married for a year and began trying to conceive in September. No luck so far but the doctor did say at our first appointment that it typically takes close to a year for most couples to conceive. She\u2019s been telling people that she\u2019s infertile (which isn\u2019t true, doctor said she isn\u2019t). \n\nMy wife and I went to my work Christmas party in mid December, where my wife met my coworkers wife (let\u2019s call her Mary) and they took a liking to each other. Mary was pregnant and invited my wife to her baby shower (which was yesterday), and my wife sounded excited to go. I asked her when we were alone if she thinks she\u2019ll be fine. I know my wife and I know what typically bothers her. I knew she wouldn\u2019t bask in happiness over someone else\u2019s pregnancy so I urged her to think it through. She said she\u2019s fine and she was excited so she went.\n\nThe baby shower was yesterday. About 40 minutes in, she calls me and asks me to come. I was at a cafe nearby because I knew she wouldn\u2019t stay long. I find her at the entrance of the house crying and a BUNCH of women consoling her. When she saw me she came to me and pulled me to the garden to talk. She said she was dancing and looked at Mary\u2019s pregnant belly and couldn\u2019t take it anymore, started crying and ran out. All of Mary\u2019s friends followed her out to console her. I consoled her myself, and said \u201cok let\u2019s go babe. Where do you want to go? We can go for a drive so you can feel better\u201d, she looked at me weird and asked why she would leave. I asked why she would stay. She said she feels better now and can go have a good time. I sighed and said \u201cbabe, you know that\u2019s not going to happen. And I doubt the attention will be on Mary after this and that\u2019s not great. It\u2019s her baby shower and she deserves to be celebrated. I can\u2019t see how people are going to shift their focus from consoling you to celebrating her if you\u2019re still there\u201d. She rolled her eyes at me and said she was going back in and that I could leave.\n\n3 hours later, the party was nearing its end so I go back to pick her up. My coworker and I stepped into the house and lo and behold, everyone is sitting in a circle with my wife being the centre of attention. Coworker looked for his wife and she wasn\u2019t there at all. He called her and she said she had left ages ago. \n\nMy wife and I entered the car and I first asked her how she was feeling and we spoke about it for a few minutes. I then asked her what happened and why Mary left. She said \u201coh crap, Mary. I forgot to say bye to her\u201d. I told her Mary left ages ago. I then said \u201cI know you\u2019re going through a hard time but why on earth would you and her friends do this? If they consoled you for a few minutes that\u2019s fine but the entire party? We really should\u2019ve left earlier\u201d. She looked at me so offended and said \u201care you Mary\u2019s husband or mine?\u201d. We stared at each other for a while and just drove home in silence. I told her I want to talk to her this morning to sort things out but she ignored me and left the house.",

        "text": "My husband's sister (38) lives with us and our kids. I'm well beyond fed up with her being here because of food issues. That's the only reason. \n\nSo, basically, every single time I make food his sister will come in and \"doctor up\" the food I'm making to her liking. Like I made steak and shrimp the other day (like Applebee's) and she waited until I left the room to put a full stick of butter in my shrimp- that was already done- and when I came back in, she goes \"I'm pretty sure that's the taste you were looking for\" and completely ruined it. It was trash. Or whenever I make spaghetti she will start dumping sugar in to the sauce, to a point of sweet spaghetti that me and my kids outright refuse to touch because it's nasty. Every single time that she can get away with it, she's doing something to the food. \n\nAnyways, my husband has started doing the same thing. I went to make home made Mac last night and cheese burgers. I went to the basement to the chest freezer to grab the veggies I needed and when I came back upstairs, my husband was putting canned chicken in to the Mac n Cheese (he knows the kids absolutely hate the taste of that) and his sister has pushing blocks of blue cheese in to the partially cooked burgers. I asked what the fuck they thought they were doing (because I've told them SO MANY TIMES to stop fucking with the food) and neither of them had any good excuse, other than \"we were just helping\". I flipped out and told them to get the fuck out of my kitchen. Both of them told me I was overreacting, etc etc.\n\nThe thing is, I've openly asked my SIL to cook several times and she won't. But she won't stop fucking with the food I'm making. My husband cooks often and I don't care if he screws with food he makes but it royally pisses me off when my cooking is messed with and he knows that. AITA?",

Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. \n\nMy 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes \"Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it.\" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said \"I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox.\" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. \n\nShe seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.\n\nJust before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnapped\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for your judgement everyone. I honestly thought it was going to have a different outcome because I felt horrible after the police arrived, like what I said was incredibly wrong of me (which it is, don\u2019t do what I did). But I\u2019m disabling reply notifications\n\nAlso, I am Australian",

        "text": "I met \"Will\" when I was 22. Will was 29, with 2 kids, and had newly been widowed. We had whirlwind courtship where he introduced me to the kids and got me involved in their lives VERY early (first few days after I met him.) Will said really quickly he was sure I was \"the one,\" not only for himself but also for his kids. That we'd have an incredible, happy family life. We got married when I was 23, Will was 30, and his kids were 8 and 6. Our wedding ceremony also included me and the kids making promises to each other, which was Will's idea. \n\nSoon Will shoved ALL the childcare onto me. I wasn't a stay at home spouse, I worked full time and always have. But he always had \"reasons\" for me to do the childcare - him being sore from doing a physical job, me being \"better\" at it since I babysat kids this age in the past and he never had. Or \"girl stuff\" for his daughter. Or cooking or anything. He always had some reason and it ended up always on me. \n\nHe started playing video games and \"relaxing\" from getting home until bed, because he was \"tired\" and he was \"bringing in the money and keeping the roof over everyone's heads,\" though that wasn't really true. He said he DESERVED to relax. Then he went out with his friends or brought them back to drink beer and watch loud TV. \n\nHe developed a major attitude with me, and encouraged same in the kids. They found it funny. He started openly disrespecting me and encouraged them to also. He was the ultimate \"fun dad\" and I got put in the role of the mean witch. Sometimes they all ganged up on me and mocked me. But also all expected me to serve them and constantly be jumping up to care for them.\n\nBy the end of the first year I realized the marriage was a big mistake, but felt guilty leaving because of my promises to the kids. Another year went by and I realized that no matter how I tried, and how I knew they were only kids and I didn't really blame them, I genuinely hated both of the kids. And I could not lie to myself any more and pretend that I loved them. I did not, and I never would. One day I just walked out, packed up everything of mine and moved out while nobody was at home. I left a note explaining it wasn't working and saying goodbye. That was the end. \n\nCue shitstorm from my ex and a bitter divorce, but we both walked away with what we went into the marriage with (not much for either of us). I had never legally adopted the kids so I had no rights or responsibilies about them and I never reached out to any of them again. Honestly I was overjoyed to be rid of all of them.\n\n15 years have gone by and that seems like a lifetime ago, or another person's life, but I'm still in my 30's. I was recently shocked to get a message from Tamara, Will's daughter, now 25. Tamara said I betrayed and traumatized her for life for \"abandoning them\" after my promises to them. She said I had a \"responsibility to never leave no matter what.\" I know she remembers the horrible way she treated me though.",

        "text": "My friend [25F] is constantly late for everything. Be it work-related or fun activities, she will always be at least 15-20 minute late. She does not have a car, and so oftentimes I [25M] will pick her up from her house (I work at a university and she is a PhD student there, and her place is along the way for me). \n\nLast time I offered her a ride to work, she ended up being 20 minutes late after I've already arrived at her place. Because of that, I ended up being late for work. She is always very apologetic about her lateness, but never changes.\n\nThis week she was supposed to give a seminar at the university which is a crucial part of her PhD program. She asked me if I could give her a ride to work that day. I told her sure, but that I was picking her up at 8 AM and she must be there exactly at 8 AM, and not a minute later. She chuckled, but I told her I wasn't joking, and she promised that she will be there. \n\nThe morning of her seminar, I drove to her place and got there at 7:55, and texted her that I was here, and she told me should would be out in \"just a minute\". At 8:00, there was no indication that she would come out (and she didn't text anything), so at 8:01, I drove off. \n\nAt around 8:20, she called me asking me where I was. I told her I was at work and that I wasn't joking when I told her that she had to be ready right that minute. She started screaming and crying over the phone, and told me that she was having a hard time that morning couldn't be ready right at 8 AM. She then begged me to come back to pick up her, as her seminar is at 9 AM and she needed to be at the school before then. I could've done it quick enough to pick her up and drop her off without affecting my work, but I decided I didn't want to do that, and told her that I won't. \n\nShe was crying and hyperventilating at that point and said she'd promise to never be late for anything else again, and reemphasized that this seminar was crucial for her PhD and that she absolutely cannot miss it without severe consequence. I responded \"oh well\", and hung up. I then went about my day at work normally. \n\nI feel like could've went back and picked her up in this scenario since it wouldn't have been detrimental to me and at the same time this was something very important for her. On the other hand, I feel like this should be a wake-up call for her chronic lateness.\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone for the kind words. \nTo answer a few common questions:\nYes, she did miss her seminar and apparently got into big trouble with the school. I don't think it's going to ruin her PhD, but there definitely are consequences. \nRegarding our friendship, it was already on its way out when this happened, and now we haven't talked at all for a while.",

The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.\n\nWe were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'\n\nHe replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.\n\nWe didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'\n\nI was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.\n\nHe told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??\n\nHe screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.\n\nI tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.\n\nI'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. \n\nHis mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.\n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!",

        "text": "Thank you all for your advice on my last post. I wasn't aware of all the laws about this kinda thing. For those of you who didn't read the OP basically my 6YO daughter is deaf and communicates using ASL. There is a public school near us but it's very bad and the whole district has a rating of 1.5/5 stars. All of our other children go to a private school near us. But the private school said they wouldn't pay for an interpreter because there is a deaf school in our county, but the deaf school only teaches speech and no sign language so we decided not to send her there. We also wanted her to go to the private school because there was a language option for ASL so she may be able to communicate with other classmates. But my brother said that we shouldn't push trying to get her in, if the school doesn't want her we should just give up.\n\nMost people said to hire a lawyer. My husband decided to contact his brother who is a disability lawyer, although he specializes in wheelchair accessibility he was willing to take our case. We discussed the situation over the phone with him and then he reached out to the private school.\n\nHe emailed back and forth with the school. We're not sure what was said exactly but by the end of it, not only did the school agree to pay for the interpreter but they also provided a free scholarship and let us request which teacher she had which they didn't let us do for any of our other kids. There is a kindergarten teacher who knows some ASL so we chose to be in her class. I'm not sure exactly why they did this but I think it's probably because denying entry to a kindergartener just because she's deaf would not look so good if other people found out. But I'm not complaining.\n\nShe started 2 weeks ago and she loves it(They are doing hybrid) she is able to make friends and talk to other kids(Though in kinda broken sign language). Her interpreter is very nice and will update us on how she did everyday unlike the interpreter she had when she was in public school. Her teacher also tried to sign when she's speaking as much as possible and so do some of the kids. Overall I'm so happy this happened and I wouldn't have known there was anything I could do about it until I asked on here, so thank all of you who replied to the OP and told me they do have to provide an interpreter for her.\n\nEdit: My pronouns are She/Her, I'm not sure why everyones referring to me as a male but just wanted to let you all know.\n\nEdit 2: To everyone concerned as to why my BIL is a disability lawyer but I came to reddit first: We barely talk to BIL. He's my husbands half-brother and there is a 16 year age gap so they aren't close. And at the time when I first posted I didn't think I could do anything legally(I talked about why in the comments) so I didn't even think of talking to my BIL. I was just concerned if I was being too pushy which is why I came to this sub rather than legal advice. Hope that clears some things up.",

        "text": "I met my wife Sonya at a restaurant where she worked as a waitress. It took me a while to finally be her boyfriend. I introduced her to my parents and they voiced out their disapproval after meeting her. My parents think that Sonya is only using me to achieve her American dream. I told them that is racist and I am very offended by their assumption. \n\nAfter my wife accepted my marriage proposal, we asked for both our family's blessing. Her parents were happy for us but my parents were gutted and refused to give their blessing. Because of this we decided to elope and only invited my brother and Sonya's bestfriends to be our witnesses. \n\nLong story short, now that we're 2 years married and after we welcomed our first child, my parents started to reach out to us. My kindhearted wife didn't think twice to welcome my parents into our lives. She let them meet our baby 2 days after being discharged from the hospital. \n\nMy parents visit us regularly and one day while dad and mom are playing with Garreth mom said something along the lines of \"aren't you the cutest baby ever? I am so glad to confirm you are indeed my grandson\". She didn't know I was around because she looked startled when I said \"what does that supposed to mean?\" Mom tried to change the subject but I insisted she tell me what she's talking about. Mom sat me down and apologized first before telling me that they had Garreth's DNA tested to make sure that he's mine. I was speechless for a moment and before I blew up from anger I told dad to give me my son and they better leave before I lose whatever respect I had left for them. My mom was very apologetic and said it's because they don't trust my wife and that our son looks nothing like me. I didn't argue anymore and told them to get out of my house. My wife was in the kitchen preparing for lunch and told her my parents had an emergency that's why they left without saying a word. I didn't tell my wife about the whole DNA test thing until after two weeks when she asked why mom and dad didn't visit anymore. I told her everything as I know I cannot keep a secret from her. She started crying and it broke my heart. I know how much she tried to win my parents' approval and what I told her was like a slap across her face.\n\nThat night she told me that she can no longer let my parents in to our child's life and I agreed with her. When mom called to ask when they can visit again, I told them they are no longer welcome in our son's life. Mom called my dad and I told him the same thing. He was livid, he called me ungrateful and cruel. He also said a few choice words about my wife which angered me more. I didn't even hear the rest because I just hung up. Did I overreact? AITA?",

        "text": "\n\nMy husband (M33) got into a car accident almost a month ago, He's been bedridden due to a back injury and I've been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue. She visits everyday but doesn't do anything to help, alternatively, she'd list all the things I should or shouldn't do. The family keeps telling me she's just worried sick for her son so I try to stay calm.\n\n\nDays ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this. She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong. I ended the conversation but my husband is upset telling me I'm being vindictive and that if his mom can't come then he'll move there with her. We argued then I went outside and he's been silent eversince.\n\n\nAITA.?",

We each apologized for how we behaved. He admitted that his friend had done some terrible things and, after some soul searching, that he and his friend do not have a healthy relationship. He loves the guy, as his friend had been there for him through some tough times, but knows Tom needs to change.\n\nI thought hard about several of the comments made on the original post, and made a tough choice. I told him that I hated the idea of bailing Tom out, and would never agree to help with his medical bills, but provided Tom made some effort to change, I would pay for him to come to the wedding with my own separate funds. I love my fianc\u00e9 more than anything and I don\u2019t want anything to mar our wedding or the start of our marriage. \n\nLong story short, we sat down with Tom\u2019s parents (who were also fed up with him and had previously refused to help with any bills) to discuss the best way to help him. We all ultimately agreed that we would cover some of his costs (us the wedding and his parents the medical bills), but only if he accepted responsibility for what he\u2019s done and hit some concrete milestones toward changing, including successfully completing a program at an in-patient treatment facility for his addictions.\n\nAll four of us sat down with him to make this offer. I won\u2019t go into details, but it didn\u2019t go well. My fianc\u00e9 finally lost it and told Tom that he\u2019d stuck by him through years of shitty choices, and that if Tom wouldn\u2019t get help, he didn\u2019t even want him as a friend, much less a best man. Tom told us all to fuck off.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him since, and it has been incredibly hard on my fianc\u00e9.\n\nThen, this past weekend, my fianc\u00e9 received a text from Tom. It wasn\u2019t long, but thanked for everything he had done for Tom, apologized \u201cfor everything\u201d and let him know that he was on his way to a treatment facility. He hoped he could stand at my fianc\u00e9\u2019s side at our wedding, like my fianc\u00e9 had always stood at his.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is trying to be cautious, but it clearly meant so much to him, and I know he believes against all odds that his friend will become a better man. I have my doubts, but you know what? I hope he does too.\n\nThanks to everyone that gave me advice, let me feel heard, and helped me become a little better as well.",

Hear me out!\n\n\nSo My bil (my husband's brother) was married to a women from Greece, Her name is *\"Nana\"*, and the reason for their divorce was because of how much my conservative bil tried to control her cloths and the places she went. He didn't want the divorce and was hopping Nana would accept the life he offered and stay but she didn't.\n\n\nThis happened 2 years ago, he now moved back with my inlaws and we'd see him more often. He tried to comment on how I dress on multiple ocassions and it's unbearable. but since my inlaws said he's struggling and depressed then I let it go.\n\nOn friday my inlaws celebrated my husband's 30th birthday at their home. I wore a heart-shaped blue dress and had my hair up. While we were eating my BIL pointed at me and said that my cleavage was showing and that I shouldn't have wore this dress because it looked inappropriate for a family gathering. I was utterly shocked, everyone was staring at me and I felt so embarrassed and on the spot. He looked at me waiting for me to blow up probably but I laughed and told him \"Knock, knock! he said \"Who\u2019s there?\", I said \"Nana\". Now he paused and seemed confused at the mention of this name. He then faked a laugh and said \"Nana who?\" I said \"Nana your goddamn business what I\u2019m wearing! ok!\". He got upset and quickly left the table. My SILs laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that I was way out of line for bringing up Nana to my BIL knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. His mom said that I was petty and didn't need to dig at him just to prove a point.\n\n\nMy husband thinks I'm in the wrong as well and that I was being deliberately hurtful by bringing up Nana.",

Which I wouldn\u2019t have minded at all if my parents treated this normally for example my friends boyfriend was also born on Christmas and he said his parents would do his birthday in the morning and Christmas in the afternoon and I wouldn\u2019t have minded that at all. However my parents said it was greedy to have two celebrations on one day so I had to choose between having Christmas with everyone else ( my family and extended family) or have my birthday on Boxing Day and not take part in Christmas ( I wouldn\u2019t have any presents or the chocolates and stuff everyone else would, I wasn\u2019t even allowed to help with the Christmas tree)  \n\nThis was pretty shit, either I had Christmas with everyone and wasn\u2019t even wished happy birthday and because we wouldn\u2019t be at school I never got happy birthdays from my friends or I was completely left out during Christmas and had a birthday where everyone was still focused on Christmas. And if I chose birthday my parents would tell my extended family I didn\u2019t want Christmas and if I chose Christmas they said I didn\u2019t want my birthday so I didn\u2019t get both from my extended family. It made my childhood absolute hell and ruined holidays for me. My first Christmas/ birthday away from home was probably the best day of my life. \n\nWell cuz of Covid my family were talking about doing a zoom call for Christmas and my mum said \u201c well I guess op gets to chose to be part of the Christmas call or we call her on Boxing Day for her birthday \u201c I don\u2019t know why but I just blew up and called her an asshole and said they ruined my childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t afford it my family is probably in the top 1% of the country money wise and even so I could\u2019ve still taken part in festivities and only had one present. But my brothers are calling me selfish and my auntie says I need to apologise. And it\u2019s Christmas so I feel like I should.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nOH MY GOD. THANK YOU EVERYONE SO MUCH!! I went to bed last night and woke up to about a million notifications. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think I can get through everyone but I\u2019m definitely trying to!! I\u2019ve had the best birthday/Christmas!! My best friend got me a Nintendo switch!! And we\u2019re going to have a huge gaming competition together and we got leftovers of kfc for lunch!!

I was hanging out with my friend (I'll call Joe\\] who is also 19, and has a crush on this girl \"Sarah\" \\[18F\\]. Anyway, we were all hanging out and there were no more seats in the car, so I suggested she sit on Joe's lap, but she chose to sit on mine, so I put a jacket on my lap so she wasn't directly on me. I felt really uncomfortable because she's just sitting her bony ass on me and I have a girlfriend, who she knows I have.\n\nAnyway, when we stopped to get gas I made her sit on my friend's lap instead and she started to full on cry because I didn't want her to sit on me and I had put a jacket. I felt awkward and bad for my friend who likes her and she was just crying on his lap and said I was a jerk.\n\nShe ended up texting me saying we have to talk about us and I said, \"what are you talking about 'us?'\" and she said that I was giving her mixed signals because she thought there was something between us. I said nope, I'm like this with all my friends, and she said I thought you were like that with Joe as a joke because he's just your friend but me it's because you liked me, and that it made her confused because she knows I have a girlfriend. I said \"nope, I'm like that with everyone\" and told her I'm happy with my girlfriend and I don't want to date her. She called me an asshole and I haven't seen her since. Her best friend texted me and said I was being an asshole. I told my girlfriend \\[19F\\] against my friends wishes (who are also her friends, not Sarah, but Joe is) and she laughed and said that boys are so oblivious and that she could tell Sarah had a crush on me but she trusted me to make the right choices. Basically, she didn't really care, just thought Sarah was kind of crappy for trying to go after a guy with a girlfriend.\n\nSo, AITA? I legit didn't really know she had a crush on me. It kind of dawned on me that night. I never pursued her. I slept over her house once because I was too drunk to drive but I slept on the floor and didn't let her near me, and I would mention my girlfriend a lot because I'm excited about dating her. Apparently she thought I liked her because she once asked me if I would join her art club and I said sure. I don't understand girls. I really don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Wow, THIS BLEW UP! Sarah and Joe ended up hanging out on their own, apparently, and she ended up trashing me, saying I was an asshole, how she liked me, etc. Joe told me privately that he knew she had a crush on me but wanted to see what I would do/enjoy the show because he thought the drama was funny. She ended up texting me again and saying how I was a jerk and basically the friendship imploded. The last thing she said was that she wasn't sorry and I said \"well I can be sorry for the both of us.\" Joe still has a crush on her and I'm sure he's still trying to date her. But, that's pretty much it for that. My girlfriend loves all the comments calling her a keeper and has found the entire situation hilarious. She really is a keeper. Thanks, everyone! ",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been in a committed relationship with my husband for 17 years, and overall, things have been great. We\u2019ve had a few rough patches, but what\u2019s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we\u2019re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.\n\nOne ongoing issue we have is my husband\u2019s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he\u2019s never experienced food scarcity. I\u2019ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we\u2019re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.\n\nToday, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn\u2019t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn\u2019t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.\n\nMy husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they\u2019re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.\n\nAll I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I\u2019m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity. Am I wrong for wanting this space?",

        "text": "Full disclosure, I do eat meat, eggs, and dairy. That being said I'm lazy and prepping and cooking meat takes more work than I'm willing to do a lot of the time, so I've built up a pretty okay repertoire of vegetarian and vegan meals. That's why I volunteered to cook last night for a small family dinner even though I would normally never. Love my mom to bits but if the first step isn't browning a pound of ground beef, she's a little lost on what to make.\n\nThis is all a thing because my brother has recently gotten engaged to a vegan woman. None of us have really spent a lot of time with her due to pandemics and generally having our own lives. The time I have spent with her has been perfectly nice. I'd thought this would also be perfectly nice.\n\nSo I did my best. I put together a dijon vinaigrette salad, pasta tossed with roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes, and because this is America where carb on carb doesn't have to be just a dream, some bread I fucking vetted to make sure it didn't have milk or eggs in it. She could eat every single thing served.\n\nAt least I thought so. We sit down, plates are dished, she has questions. Whatever, fair enough. I can imagine that she's been in situations where things seemed safe to eat but surprise, there's honey in the salad dressing or something. Reassurances are made, I did my homework but...she has other complaints. You roasted the veggies in olive oil? There's olive oil in the salad dressing? The pasta isn't whole wheat? This is white bread? Yes. Vegan, all of it, but not stripped down to as few calories as possible. Anddddd now she won't eat, just sat there and tore one of the rolls up into tiny pieces until the table was cleared.\n\nMy brother texted me later that night about how fucked up it was that she had to go home hungry, and this is where I may be the asshole. I replied something in the effect of saying I thought I had to cook to accommodate veganism, not an eating disorder. He told me to go fuck myself, which again, fair. Now I imagine a cold war is brewing and mom is inevitably going to get sucked in. I also could have tried to make something healthier, though I don't think what was served was that bad. AITA?",

        "text": "Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named \"Billy\". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.\n\nI asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.\n\nWhen he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said \"To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance.\" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.\n\nMy SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?\n\nEdited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. \n\nAlso, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments. I've been so choked up reading them all.",

        "text": "I (23F) am an avid hiker in Australia. Last week I encountered a middle aged woman, around 50 years old as I was coming off a trail. She was walking in my direction as I came out of the bush. It was strange to see her, the sun was almost down and the weather was starting to turn. also, this was an intermediate collection of trails at best, difficult even for me at worst. and she didn't look super athletic. Point is, my 'weird' radar was going off already.\n\nShe walked up to me and stopped, standing too close for my comfort, gestured toward the clearing where my car was parked, and asked whether it was my car. No greeting or anything. When I looked over something made me uncomfortable- there were no cars other than mine in sight. The trail I was on isn't crazy far from civilization but it's not a walk away- one of those highway rest stops that's there for the trail and a few parking spots. no way she could have got there without driving.\n\nI let her know that, yes, it was my car, to which she responded something like \"Perfect, there's a storm coming, I can't be caught in it and I need to get home\". She was very matter of fact. It seemed like she had already decided what would happen. without waiting for my response, she started striding for my car. I am glad I always lock my doors because she would have hopped right in the passenger seat had the door opened.\n\nAs she was walking over to it, I went after her trying to explain that I wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to hitch a ride- asking why she was out here in the first place. I was talking to a brick wall until she realised the car was locked, at which point she turned around with this look of anger and frustration on her face. She starts ranting- the same stuff as before \"I NEED to get home\" \"A STORM is coming\" \"I CANNOT be caught in it\" \"Why don't you get it?!\". I was very confused at this point, and a little scared, as this woman was now a barrier between me and my vehicle. I told her something like 'I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable with having a stranger in my car'.\n\nShe stared me down for a few seconds, I guess trying to gauge her chances at asking again. And just like that, the anger drops from her face and she\u2019s silent. I was really uncomfortable. I asked if I could call someone, if there was another way to help. she starts walking- towards me (scary), but then right past me. I'm still asking her questions, then just saying things like \"hello\" and \"excuse me\". no response. She walked to the other end of the rest stop and maintained eye contact with me as she sat down on a log, then just stared at nothing.\n\nI didn\u2019t follow her. I got into my car really shaken up and drove away. As soon as I was back in cell range I called fire and rescue, they said they would send someone out. I was scared for my safety in the moment, but she was just some woman alone in the middle of nowhere. Am I the asshole for refusing this strange woman a ride/shelter in my car?",

He pays for the mortgage, bills, household needs, food, kids needs.....etc he has set a monthly budget for each category and handles getting everything done. Recently, he has become overwhelmed and told me to handle grocery shopping but before he let me, he asked me to write a list of all the stuff we need so he could calculate the total and also so he'd have an idea how much I'll be spending when I take his credit card. I didn't have an issue with that because this way we'd watch our spending habits. however, he said I'm never allowed to get something that isn't on the list unless I'm paying for it some other way.\n\n\n\nOn friday I was doing some grocery shopping as usual and saw that the store had some nice shoes on sale. the price was insanly low for this brand and so I decided to grab a pair for my husband thinking he'd be happy with them since he needed new sneakers anyway. I bought them and when I showed them to him he flipped out on me saying I made a huge mistake by buying something that was not on the list. I agreed with him but I thought that since the shoes were for him then it'd be different, he said I screwed up and shouldn't have bought those sneakers without even telling him. but in my defense I said that the price was low so it's not like I spent $100 on shoes, and also I saw this as a great deal and wanted him to have those nice sneakers. He plainly said that what I did is considered \"stealing\" since he never consented to have those sneakers purchased and said that I'm being irresponsible with money that is why I no longer have an income and my spending habits need a \"grib\". I felt hurt by what he said. We argued about it for hours and he avoided speaking to me the rest of the day.\n\nThe next day I went and returned the sneakers and took the money back. He got home in the evening and lost it when he found out I returned them. He said he couldn't believe how petty and childish I was to do actually do this. I explained I was just correcting my \"mistake\". he tried to contact the store and was told the sneakers were already sold. He got even angrier with me but I told him that he accused me of stealing for him when I was just trying to do a nice gesture for him, He yelled that I had a lot of nerve calling what I did \"nice gesture\" while using his money to do it. I told him he had no right to yell at me after I corrected my \"mistake\" and gave back the money he accused me of stealing.\n\n\nHe threw a fit then went out with his friends and came home late at night still not talking to me.\n\n\nDid I mess up? maybe I shouldn't have purchased them knowing they weren't on the list but I just wanted him to have those sneakers and thought I was doing a nice gesture.",

        "text": "On my phone, sorry about any formatting issues. \n\nI(28f) come from a very traditional Indian family. I left them when I came to USA for uni because I knew that if I accepted their help in paying my fees they would hold it against me later and I got a part time job along with the financial aid I was receiving. I maintained low contact and didn't visit them in person until I was 26, when they contacted me on my younger brother passing uni.\n\nFor the last two years, I have visited them four times and each time they've been talking about marriage although I stated very clearly that I wasn't interested. They brought up kids and how finding guys willing to marry older women was hard. I said no problem because I'm child free and that I don't need/want them to find a guy for me.\n\nJanuary this year, I went to visit them and they said that they had something 'special' for me and that I would absolutely love it. The day after I reached their home, they said they were throwing me a 'welcome home party'. I thought they were trying to fix our relationship and let it be.\n\nThey invited a lot of people and it had obviously already been planned. An hour in, my parents introduced me to a man in his thirties(F) and his parents.\n\nSo, next thing I know, F goes down on one knee and whips out a beautiful ring. I'm surprised and angry at my parents for still trying to control my life and putting me in such a situation.\n\nI said no, but then our parents began to push my buttons and I exploded. I called F, his parents and my parents low-lifes for trying to trick me and basically insulted their views, calling them misogynistic and disgusting.\n\nTold them to go f themselves and left. I packed my bags and went to stay at a hotel until it was time for my flight. My mom cried and begged me to stay and said that they had already paid for half of the dowry and ring. I stopped responding to my parent's calls and texts because I was done with them.\n\nMy cousins and some old friends have been telling me that I was being unfair by being so rude to F and his parents. Thing is, they were in on it. They expected me to say yes and sent me a lot of insults when I refused to reconsider. \n\nThey were humiliated and in their tiny group of small-minded people, my parents were being ostracized for raising a 'whore' of a daughter. F and his parents were also humiliated because they were rejected by a 'whore'. \n\nAITA for being so rude? I feel like I should've handled the situation more delicately, rather than blowing up at all of them.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I did not expect so many NTA's or responses. When I said that they were 'in on it' I meant that my parents had told them that I hadn't met the 'right guy' and that I would come around, which is why they kept trying. My parents expected me to surrender all my savings and money to F, live with F and his family in India, procreate with F three times and do all the housework when I can't even make a poached egg. \n\nAbout letting me go to college, I told them two weeks before leaving for it and lived at my friend's house with all my important documents, because I knew that they would do pretty much anything to keep me from going. They called my uni and said that I wouldn't be joining. Uni contacted me and I cleared it up. That's why I didn't talk to them and declined to let them pay.\n\nFor those of you who told me to wear a faux ring- I'm engaged to my girlfriend of five years and my parents aren't getting an invite to the wedding. I knew that they'd ask me about it if they saw it and disapprove of anyone that wasn't Indian- let alone a female.\n\nThank you for your responses and I am never talking to my parents again.",

They got really angry when my brother and SIL announced recently that their daughter would be their only child and they do not want biological kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom and dad lost their shit. They told my brother he *had* to get my SIL pregnant. He was the family's male heir and he would have to have a biological son to carry forward the family name. This makes no sense to me, nor my bro and SIL. It's not as if we're a family of European royalty. Who gives a fuck about the family name in this day and age? Well, my parents do apparently. They've been berating my brother and guilt tripping my sister in law, making her feel like she's taking something away from our family. On one occasion they actually suggested that my brother leave my SIL if she didn't want to get pregnant and have a son with another woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's even worse is that they've stopped paying attention to my niece. Earlier, they would call and talk to her almost everyday. But ever since they were told about my bro and SIL's decision, they've stopped calling her. This pisses me off and has deeply saddened my bro and SIL. The child is  3 years old and doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, when I called my brother, he seemed very upset. He told me that mom and dad had called him and they had talked about something unrelated. When he asked if they wanted to talk to their granddaughter, they said they'd talk to their *real* grandchild when my brother came to his senses and decided to give them one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was angrier than I've been in a long time. I called my parents and unloaded on them. I told them how selfish and cruel they were being  and how dare they take out their anger on my niece, along with a lot of other things I can't even remember. My mom started crying as she's not used to being yelled at. I understand that yelling at them may have been a bit much, but I just can't believe how awful they are being towards a kid. So am I the asshole? Or are they?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT  : Some people have been wondering how my parents would act when I have kids. No need to worry about that since I won't be having any. I made this clear to my parents years ago and yes they threw a fit over this. ",

She is currently living in a group home. The government pays for a good portion of the cost but not all.  My parents have made sure that they have accessed every resource available for her to make sure she has as good a life as she can. \n\nI was we were visiting her this last weekend when they brought it up again.  They are both reasonably healthy but they both had health scares in the last couple of years.  They once again said that I would be her guardian.  \n\nI have been giving this a fair bit of thought. I have two older brothers. They are both married and established in their careers. They would be better choices than I am.  \n\nI want to go see the world. I am lucky enough that my job can be done from anywhere that I can access the internet.  \n\nWhen we went sort dinner I brought it up and said that I had three ideas.  \n\n1. They make all three of us her guardians so we could split the responsibilities and duties. \n\n2. They leave their entire estate to my sister in a trust that will oversee her care. \n\n3. They leave me their entire estate with the proviso that I become her sole guardian and take full responsibility. Minus sentimental stuff for the rest of my family obviously. \n\nI thought that was fair since it's not like they are rich and their estate will mostly consist of their house and the insurance policies they took out when they realized the long term costs of care for my sister.  \n\nThey said that I'm trying to shirk my responsibility to my sister and that I'm greedy for trying to get everything.  \n\nI had one last suggestion and they really hated it.  I said that they were welcome to cut me completely out of their will.  But that had to include guardianship of my sister.  They could leave everything to her and my brothers but that meant I would be completely free of responsibility for her care.  \n\nMy dad got really angry and my mom was crying when I left.  \n\nMy brothers both called me to say I was being an asshole springing this on my parents. And that I was being greedy trying to keep them and their families from getting anything when our parents pass away.  I asked both if them if they wanted 100% responsibility for our sister in return for the entire estate. I volunteered to sign away everything to them.  Neither one took me up on the offer.",

        "text": "hi please let me know because i\u2019m honestly not sure. for context, my university is completely online, I\u2019m male and 20 years old. \n\nOkay, last week, a family emergency happened, and it required my aunt and uncle to leave their house at late night. I live close to them, and they have a baby that\u2019s less than a year old. So, they called my parents to tell them about the emergency, and then called me. They asked if I could come into their house, take care of their baby, until they came back, and I was down with that. I\u2019ve taken care of babies before, so, this wasn\u2019t new to me.\n\nTook my stuff, and drove to their house, stayed with my cousin. Now, by the time my morning class comes about, my aunt and uncle haven\u2019t shown up yet, which was within expected (they told me they\u2019ll be back by one-two PM), and I had my baby cousin in my lap, setting up laptop for my morning class, and my cousin falls asleep, and I\u2019m like OK. I can deal with this. A sleeping baby is the best kind of baby. Do not move them. \n\nNow, here\u2019s the problem. I had a presentation to do, and so my video is off, as I\u2019m preparing to give it, and the professor goes \u201cOP, please turn on your camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh. I have a sleeping baby right now, so\u2026 is that okay with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA sleeping baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, there was a family emergency, so my cousin\u2019s asleep on me right now, um\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say the details in class, but I can email you after class, and supply any proof you need.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, please turn on your camera.\u201d\n\nSo I do, and my cousin is asleep, and I give the entire presentation, and I\u2019m really proud of how it went, because I think I did really well, and I answer all questions, and my cousin doesn\u2019t wake up! Like this is the best case scenario.\n\n\nWell, last night, I got my grade for the powerpoint, along with an email from the professor that says she marked me down because she felt the baby was there as a pity prop, and I was attempting to gain sympathy, and if I hadn\u2019t had the baby, I would\u2019ve gotten higher.\n\n\nSo was I the asshole for showing up with a baby? I didn\u2019t think about the pity aspect.\n\nedit :- sorry for the sporadic replies. i am still a university student balancing my shit. few clarifications. Yes, I did send her the proof she would\u2019ve required to see there was an emergency. Yes, I will be reporting - and updating. Yes, there are better ways I could\u2019ve done this, but a stressed and sleep deprived student isn\u2019t normally the best source of judgement. The class was a philosophy one.",

Then we found out our dad wasn't our bio dad, which even he didn't know, it then turned out my older siblings shared a bio dad but I had a different one. We were also first cousins because their bio and my bio were brothers.\n\nDad left our mom, hurt, betrayed, and overall disgusted that she had lied to him for two decades. I was equally mad that she lied and hurt my dad. My siblings were less willing to cut her off but their relationship strained majorly.\n\nDad moved in with me and my then boyfriend, now fiance, and Covid hit. At this point all three of us agreed he was dad no matter what. And there was nothing that could change that.\n\nI meant it; they didn't.\n\nThey found their bio father and mine by extension, and have decided that he is now \"real dad\" and that our dad is just a stepdad. My brother has even corrected his two little girls who called dad grandpa, into saying he's stepgrandpa and that's what they call him, while bio gets called grandpa.\n\nIt broke my dad's heart and he decided it was too much for him to accept. This is after talks between them where he was essentially told to know his place, stay in his lane and demoted with the clear message being nothing would change. I am so pissed at them. They have tried to push me to meet my \"real dad\" and have told me it's okay to go back on what we said.\n\nInitially, they were invited to my wedding but with this whole mess I told them they were no longer welcome and I did not want them to show up. They told me that just because they have a relationship with their \"real dad\" doesn't change things between us. I told them it does. That if dad isn't our real dad after EVERYTHING he has done for us then we're not \"real siblings\", because technically we are HALF siblings and cousins. That my dad is till my dad 100% and biology is meaningless to me. And so it was best for them not to come, because I no longer want them there.\n\nWhat I said hurt them. My SIL (married to my brother) told me I was an asshole for throwing half in their faces and cutting them from my wedding like we haven't been siblings our whole lives. I think that's almost more annoying to me, because that's our dad. But he can be shit on and discarded like he's nothing.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.\n\nWe've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.\n\nWhen she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.\n\nThis was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes.\u00a0\n\nDespite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.\n\nAnd unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.\n\nAnd well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless. AITA, Reddit?",

        "text": "Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. \n\nHe values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP\" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.\n\n\nThis past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.\n\n\nI could be wrong for what I've done but I was frustrated and mad. AITA?",

        "text": "Sorry for the appalling title. My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who\u2019s saving up to buy her own home. \n\nSince she\u2019s moved in with us (past 3 months) she\u2019s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren\u2019t environmentally conscious enough because we don\u2019t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. \n\nMy cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what\u2019s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. \n\nWe feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It\u2019s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that\u2019s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. \n\nHer dad and I both told her if she\u2019s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she\u2019s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren\u2019t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don\u2019t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn\u2019t processed or full of sugar or grain. It\u2019s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. \n\nMy MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted. She says we are letting her get sick, and that Mango won\u2019t hurt from a change in diet but stepdaughter is hurting.",

        "text": "[Link to my original post](https://ps.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mkps8k/aita_for_checking_my_blood_sugar_at_my_desk_when/).\n\nI\u2019m really glad I posted, it gave me the reassurance I needed that I was doing the right thing going to HR. I took your guy\u2019s advice on how to approach the conversation with HR. I said that me and my coworker have conflicting medical needs and I could use advice on a solution that would work for both of us. The HR lady said that I have every right to continue to test my blood sugar in my office. When I told her that James suggested I test only at specific times of the day, her eyes got really big and she was like, \u201cNO. Do not test your blood sugar on a schedule suggested to you by your coworker. Only your doctor.\u201d\n\nLater HR spoke to James as well. Here\u2019s what we agreed to with HR:     \n-James is to call me on the phone before coming to my office. As in, \u201cHey, can I come ask a question?\u201d and I say sure and ensure I\u2019m not checking my blood sugar at that moment.      \n-I cannot test my blood sugar in front of James. I wasn\u2019t doing this anyway.     \n-If James\u2019 phobia symptoms are triggered for whatever reason, he is entitled to a ten-minute break to let his symptoms subside, in addition to the normal breaks we all get.\n\nThis system worked great...for a week. One day he called as usual, I said sure come over, but then he...didn\u2019t come over. After about ten minutes I actually needed to check my blood sugar but thought with my luck he\u2019d walk in at the exact moment I was testing. I ended up calling him back and he said that he got distracted and forgot he had a question for me. A few days later it happened again, and I was a bit annoyed that twice I delayed testing because I thought he was going to be entering my office at any second. \n\nSoon after I found out that James had put in his two-week notice. He explained that me being diabetic wasn\u2019t the only reason why he was quitting, he wanted different hours etc, but that it did play a role. Later, Megan (our other coworker) told me that James told her that he really struggled with me being diabetic. For example, even just thinking, \u201cI need to ask a question, but I have to call first to make sure he\u2019s not checking his blood sugar\u201d was distressing to him because then he\u2019d be thinking about it, which would make him feel queasy and anxious.\n\nJames has quit now. While I\u2019m relieved that I don\u2019t have to feel like a leper at work anymore, I mostly just feel bad for James. It must be awful living with a phobia that severe and I know he didn\u2019t choose to be that way. I hope he continues to see his therapist and can improve.\n\nSo I guess this doesn\u2019t have a happy ending because ultimately we couldn\u2019t work it out and he quit.",

It\u2019s not usually a lot; it\u2019s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn\u2019t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said \u201cWhat the fuck man? Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not \u201crespecting\u201d his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, \u201chis dietary restrictions shouldn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t eat my food\u201d. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn\u2019t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?",

When I bought my property 5 years ago I basically lived at least 5 minutes away from the nearest house, however the villages and towns have been expanding and as a result started developing houses next to my property.\n\nI was fine with it, nothing I could do about it to begin with, but my property is big enough not to really notice to begin with, or so I assumed.\n\nIt's good to mention I basically pulled out a bunch of trees when I moved here and made a dirt road with gravel of sorts to allow me easy access to the main road nearby instead of driving all the way around to access the main road.\n\nWell soon after people started moving in to the houses I noticed people basically used my little road to access the main road nearby and kids used my field to play football, I was pretty much okay with it because it wasn't bothering me or inconveniencing me.\n\nUntill a few months later that was, basically whenever people had a party or a gathering I noticed my road and the field which they drove over was full of cars and a few weeks later some people started straight up using it as a parking area. I had multiple talks with multiple people and the results ranged from apologetic people moving their cars to aggressive people who told me to go F myself.\n\nI finally had enough and started getting cars towed which led to people yelling at my girlfriend in particular, as such I build a large stone fence around my entire property.\n\nWell multiple neighbors including the aggressive ones were all apologetic and asked me to remove the fence and how sorry they were for using it as they basically had to add 15 to 20 minutes to their travel time to work without my shortcut, I told them to go F themselves and to get the F of my property and if I saw them there again I'd be letting my dogs loose.\n\nHowever this is also impacting the nice neighbors so I am conflicted.",

When I was four months pregnant my son, who was in college at the time told me that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. I wasn't very happy but I've been supportive and I've given them a lot of financial assistance.\n\nI had my daughter two months ago and named her Clara. My son's girlfriend went ballistic. She said they were going to name their daughter Clara and that I should have consulted with them (umm I got pregnant first, but whatever) I told her she needs to grow up and that she doesn't own the name. My son asked me if I would consider changing Clara's name. I said no and he stormed out of the house.\n\nWell they told me the other day they are going to name their daughter Paxtyn. I guess I made a face and she started yelling at me that it is my fault, because I stole the only name she likes. I even asked her if she likes the name Paxtyn and she said she is going to like it when I have to tell my friends I have a granddaughter named Paxtyn. So she pretty much said she hates me more than she loves her daughter.\n\nMy son said I have two months to fix this (change Clara's name) and I told them that they are both idiots, and I feel bad for their future child. I also said if they name their daughter Paxtyn just to be spiteful I will not give them any further assistance. My son called me up and said I was being controlling, but when I asked him if he actually likes the name he hung up\n\nEdit: They never mentioned the name Clara to me\n\nSecond Edit: Alright, I took some of your advice and texted her that I've been thinking about it and I kind of like the name Paxtyn and she wrote back \"fuck you, you evil bitch\" so I think that's the end of their money.",

We messaged back and forth and while I kept a lot of my childhood details private, we did make plans to meet him and my mother. They weren't married to each other by the way.\n\nWhen I got to the restaurant, I was very shocked and honestly upset to find my father and mother had brought their spouses, as well as their children to surprise me. My father's mother, so my grandmother was also there.\n\nI was already feeling very emotional about the whole thing and seeing everyone there didn't help.\n\nSo I sat through an hour of listening to them sharing all about their lives while I fake smiled through everything. Honestly, I felt very jealous that they had kids they really loved and how they all had really happy lives after ditching me.\n\nThen they started asking about me and my parents, and how my Facebook gave very little away about my life.\n\nI basically lost it and started crying like a little bitch (lol) and told them how shitty my adoptive parents were and how shitty foster life was. \n\nI was pretty snarky and sarcastic when I said  that I'm glad their lives worked out for them because mine sure as hell didn't.\n\nI couldn't stop crying and my father had to drop me back home. He was very apologetic.\n\nI feel very shitty about it. I made my mother and father cry at the restaurant. They were really nice people. \n\nI got a few messages from my mother and father separately where they've been apologizing and if they could make it up to me.\n\nMy mother in particular seems really upset by everything and I hate that I may have messed up her happy life. Her last message basically said that she's been unable to sleep and wants to see me again.\n\nI've been ignoring their messages and just been focusing on school instead.\n\nAITA?

I apologized for putting her in the situation she was in and that I genuinely thought that he had known. She basically said that it was ok, he knows now, and not to worry. She had talked to him and told him that we were together but didn\u2019t tell him we were married, which she said needed to come from me. I agreed. I said I was going to give him some time to process and reflect on things, and that I didn\u2019t want to reach out too soon before he was ready. \n\n\nI waited a week to talk to him, in that time an aunt of mine said she spoke with him. They spoke for a while and his general sentiment was that he was worried that we could lead happy lives together, i.e. could we find a home? Could we have kids? Would we be able to keep our jobs? She said they had a really good talk and that she was able to reassure him on his worries. She told me I should talk to him and give him a chance to see how happy we are. \n\n\nThis weekend I went to visit him. My aunt and mom came with too. \n\n\nAfter we chatted for a while I told my grandpa that I had some news. I told him that my wife and I had actually gotten married this summer. I made it clear that it was a very small ceremony, and that our parents couldn\u2019t even attend. And that because of that we are planning on having a big wedding celebration in a year or two after covid is over so all of our family and friends could celebrate. \n\n\nI explained that I was just nervous to tell him, and that I was worried what he would think. He said \u201cwell I\u2019m 85! My opinion doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d\n\n\nWe talked a little bit more, I made sure to mention that we were very happy, and that our jobs knew and our neighbors knew when we bought our house. I also mentioned that my wife\u2019s parents went to the same college my parents and all my mom\u2019s siblings went to, and he thought that was pretty cool. I told him that I didn\u2019t have a chance to tell grandma before she passed, and that I really miss her and had hoped she could see how happy we were together. We all had a little cry and talked about how much we miss her. \n\n\nThe next morning, a different aunt called me and said that when she went and visited grandpa he was all excited. \u201cDid you hear we\u2019re going to have a big party after covid? (OP) is having a wedding celebration!\u201d She and I had a good talk and it sounds like grandpa is doing well with the news and that everything worked out ok!!!",

        "text": "I (m32) have two older brothers (m38 and m40) and a sister (f34). Note the age differences. Our dad passed away 5 years ago in our hometown (a more suburban town in Wisconsin).\n\nOur family was relatively modest when my brothers grew up, so they were cared for a lot by my parent\u2019s families who are very conservative. My dad personally, was not. By the time me and my sister were born, our dad\u2019s career was doing great and we were well off. Me and my sister have Master\u2019s while our brothers didn\u2019t go to college despite the funds and chances.\n\nMy mom had been trying to set my sister up with a churchgoer\u2019s kid. This didn\u2019t progress until around the time my dad died and my sister came back and helped with the funeral. My brother\u2019s families are both in town as well. I worked in tech in China then and live in SF now and since the funeral have been mostly LC with everyone except my sister. Honestly, I was very close with my dad and there was obvious favoritism towards me which the others didn\u2019t like. So, my mom and oldest brother now technically live in my house.\n\nMy sister somehow ended up leaving her career and moving back. She married the man my mom set her up with in 2019. I honestly was in shock at the wedding. I really didn\u2019t ever see my sister living on a farm and becoming a stay at home mom. I knew for a fact my mom and brothers had a huge part in this, because there were a lot of \u201cshe\u2019s back home\u201d posts. Later I found out that she had pretty much given all her savings to her husband.\n\nLate 2020, my sister, straight out of the blue started calling me and just \u201cchatting\u201d about things. I of course, love this. Early in 2021, my mom told me she was pregnant. I immediately asked my sister about this and she kinda broke down. In short, the husband has been abusive, she\u2019s broke and my family and her in laws haven\u2019t helped. My oldest brother wailed at her about how his wife went through the same thing and my sister should stop thinking she\u2019s special. The first time she called me, he had kicked her out of their home for complaining about their finances. This was fairly common.\n\nThis is where IATA: I basically yelled at her too. I told her that she had a career which she can still go back to and I can help her move back to NYC (where she worked / studied before). And that the pregnancy wasn\u2019t the end of it and there were other options.\n\nThe next day she asked me for 5k which I sent to her without asking. I didn\u2019t hear much after and didn\u2019t intrude coz it was a total mindfuck. A month later my sister told me she had gotten a new job in NYC and filed for divorce. The pregnancy is also no longer on the table.\n\nNow my family has been blowing up my social media calling me all sorts of shit. I\u2019ve in general called them shit back as well and the home might be on the market soon. My sister needed to switch apartments and got a restraining order against her ex and well\u2026 things aren\u2019t great, but I\u2019m happy my sister is better. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I messed up a date and fixed some grammar.\n\nEdit: Wow, I just woke up and did not not expect a response like this. Thank you everyone, this helps a lot!\nI saw a couple of posts mentioned they had been in the same predicament as my sister and I\u2019d really like to say that you aren\u2019t alone. Please, please reach out to those you have ever been close to.",

We tried anyway, but despite our best efforts we found no improvement in the cancer. My daughter is aware of this.\n\nWell, recently, my wife was looking for a hair straightener my daughter had borrowed and found a few grams of marijuana, an elf-bar vape, as well as a partially empty handle of Tito's Vodka in her bedroom. When confronted, my daughter confessed to have been using these substances for about a month at that point. She said that since she knew she wasn't likely going to survive past 18, she wanted to try these things socially, and assured us she was being responsible with them.\n\nI myself am a user of these substances, as we live in a legal state. I do not vape, though I do smoke cigarettes, drink, and will occasionally roll myself a joint. While normally I would not want my children using these, I thought I could make an exception due to the circumstances. My wife, however, disagrees. She only drinks a glass of wine every now and then, and dislikes nicotine and marijuana.\n\nWe had a conversation and came to the conclusion that she would be allowed to do these things under my supervision, as long as they are from retail stores and dispensaries and not street dealers, though my wife remains adamant she should not be doing them at all.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": " \n\nI (23) am getting married to my boyfriend of 6 years in June. We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.\n\nMy mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.\n\nSo, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.\n\nHe's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?",

        "text": "My (25m) wife died 19 months ago. It was real hard on my the first few months but finally started putting myself back out there. I met girlfriend (23F) 7 months ago. It was going pretty well and she moved into my apartment around 4ish months ago. In hindsight we probably rushed this.\n\nMy girlfriend is very overprotective and clingy and scared of me cheating as she\u2019s been hurt in the past. I let her have my phone password so she could ease her mind. She saw a photo of me and wife and asked who she was and I explained. She seemed to take it well but was a little bit awkward about it.\n\nFast forward 3 days and I go to take a shower and leave my phone on charge in the bedroom. I come out to see my phone unlocked. Weird but I let it slide. Later in that day I go through my photos to upload a new profile picture to Facebook. All the photos of my wife and me and her together are gone without a trace. I check my Snapchat my eyes only because I had a few in there along with intimate photos of us together. I knew it was my girlfriend.\n\nI confronted her about it and she started yelling. She said I need to get over it and get rid of all the reminders of my wife because she was here now. She also called me really creepy for \u201chaving nude pictures of a dead girl\u201d. (Granted i probably should have deleted those a long time ago but I didn\u2019t want to because they were special to me, might be AH on my part there). I was livid. I told her to get out. She stared at me in disbelief as I told her again. She packed some stuff and left. I went to my room and cried. I woke up to many missed calls and angry texts from her and her friends for calling me the AH. This might not have been a big deal but she permanently got rid of 95% of the pictures of my wife. I still have some printed like the wedding and some vacations, but I\u2019m still missing a big chunk of them. I feel like she deleted a part of me as well. I\u2019ve had to block multiple numbers (including my sisters, wtf). I do miss her though and want to talk but I\u2019m confused. Reddit, am I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit 2: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support. I\u2019m taking your advice and kicking her out of my life for good. I\u2019m also going to my local tech store later as they said there might be a way to recover my photos. I love you all !",

I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.\n\nMy wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.\n\nAnd although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.\n\nA few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.\n\nMy daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.\n\nMy wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.\n\nShe also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.\n\nAnd the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.\n\nI admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.\n\nBut this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.\n\nMy daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.\n\nMy wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.\n\nI disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.\n\nI'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house.

        "text": "I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. \n\nFast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like \"What kinda name is Dimitri?\", or \"You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name.\" \n\nIt's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of \"You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.\"\n\nSo my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?",

        "text": "For context: I haven't seen my full family together in quite some time, so they set up a get together at a park today. The family gathering includes me (22m), my brother (21), my sister (25), her husband (29) and their two kids, my dad, step-mom and her kids (6 and 9) aunt, uncle, my two cousins (15 and 20), grandma, and grandpa. \n\nI get there with some picnic items (I brought a quiche and the cups) and see a few members setting up. I say hi and help set up the tables and set the food out. We talk and play games while the others show up. When everyone gets there, we sit down to eat. I sit next to my dad and get a weird look from my aunt as she says to me, \"this is the adult's table.\" To which I reply, \"I am an adult(?).\" She tells me that the 1st and 2nd generations are considered adult and the 3rd and 4th generations should sit at the kid's table since we \"don't have much to contribute to adult conversations.\" I tell her that I can drink, that I drove here, that I pay rent and have a job, so how am I still considered a child? She says that until I have kids of my own I'll have to sit at the kid's table.\n\nAccording to my aunt, there are 8 children (ages 6-22) and 8 adults (ages 25-75) so I should just sit at the kid's table since it'll be even, but there is plenty of space at the adult table and I don't want to be stuck with 5 literal children. She still disagrees and at this point my uncle and grandparents back her up, so I say fuck it, take my quiche back, tell them to have a nice day, and drive away. I get a few texts telling me to come back by my dad and grandparents. I ask if aunt is going to apologize and they ask \"for what?\" That was enough for me to disregard their other messages and calls until I got home, where I am now.\n\nI feel shitty that I may have possibly ruined a nice family gathering, but feel my family doesn't respect me at all, enough to say that I am still a child and apparently have the same mentality as 6 year olds. AITA?\n\nEdit: This really blew up! Thanks for the awards and all the positive comments. And no, this doesn't mean that these bridges are burned. Family is family, but I'll make my own private table with blackjack and hookers next time, with VIP access. Last thing I want to say is that you just lost The Game.",

        "text": "I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.\n\nRecently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.\n\nMy dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual \u201cHey how\u2019s Amber,\u201d way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, \"That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?\"\n\nMy dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, \"The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.\"\n\nRight then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to \"one up\" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.\n\nMy mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay \"really well\", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.\n\nI called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.\n\nIt has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is. So, AITA?",

My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.\n\nSo I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.\n\nThis is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.\n\nI asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.\n\nOverall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.\n\nEDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

However, judging by the responses I got, I\u2019m not sure whether anyone will like what happened!\n\nI first had a conversation with my girlfriend, we\u2019ve only been together a year and I\u2019m buying the flat completely on my own, but there was certainly a suggestion that she might move in with me depending on how things go in the next few months or so. She was (and generally is) pretty wonderful, and she\u2019s also met Bill and knows what he means to me. She said if I wanted to offer him my spare room for a few months then I should go for it.\n\nThen Bill. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but I laid it all out for him. I basically said that I didn\u2019t want a roommate and that now that I was in a relationship, my privacy was even more important to me. I said that it was important Daisy (my goddaughter) also felt at home in my place, so the spare room was basically going to be hers. I then said that he was one of my closest friends and I\u2019d do anything for him if I could. I said that he could move in with me, rent free, for three months, providing he got a job and saved up some money to rent a room somewhere after. We ironed out a few more details but that was the general gist.\n\nIt was really emotional, Bill kept apologising and we both cried- but it was a good conversation.\n\nThe reason why I wanted to update is because [u/brecollier](https://www.reddit.com/user/brecollier/) wrote this comment, which was downvoted:\n\n*NAH but these are the times I hate this sub because the bar is so low. No you aren\u2019t an AH, but you have the opportunity to change a close friend\u2019s life. None of those are good reasons why you can\u2019t, they are reasons why you don\u2019t want to. You should do better than not being an AH and be a really good human and let him come live with you.*\n\nI really appreciated all the responses to my post, but they did initially make me righteously angry, if that makes sense? Through my N-T-A validation, I was kind of getting annoyed at Bill, thinking \u2018what right did he have to my home, and how dare he be mad about an offer I made 4 years ago\u2019. And then I read the above comment and suddenly thought, yeah, he\u2019s got no right to be mad at me but if he really is one of my best friends, then surely I should help him if I can? And the fact is, I totally can.\n\nSo there you go, Bill will be moving into my new place, and in the meantime I\u2019m gonna help him rewrite his CV so he can start to look for jobs in my town. Maybe this is a bad decision, and this sub has certainly made me realise I don\u2019t owe him anything, but it still feels like the right thing to do.\n\nThanks Reddit!\n\nEDIT: Holy crap guys! I did not expect so many replies/comments! Thank you to everyone who replied, and especially thanks to the lovely person who messaged offering support for Bill to write a cover letter.\n\nJust to clarify, I'm a girl, not a guy :)\n\nI do appreciate the people warning me not to do this but my mind is made up and I really think it's the right decision. I understand it may not work out but I believe in Bill, and our friendship, and know he wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt me. If I'm allowed, I'll write an update in 3/6 months (not sure how the rules of updates work in this sub?) and hopefully I can give you all good news!",

        "text": "\n\n\nI (F33) have been engaged to my fiance (M37) for 5 months. We don't share finance because that's what he wants. I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say \"no\" or \"why should I pay for this?\" he'd respond with \"the 30% that's why\". he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it.\n\n\nSeveral times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say \"no\", I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay.\n\n\nLast tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he \"got this\" and \"no worries\".\n\n\nWe got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back \"noooo\" but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said \"you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?\".\n\n\nI was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home.\n\n\nI started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out.\n\nHis friends didn't speak to me on this but he told me they're disappointed in my behavior and are telling him to take time and \"reflect\" on the type of woman he's gonna be married to.\n\nAITA for what I did? Is what he's expecting from me fair or justified?.\n\nETA: Some info:\n\n(1) he said that because the restaurant wasn't expensive then I could have just paid.\n\n(2) He admitted not telling me about it til later knowing I'd refuse. He still thinks my reaction was childish and unacceptable.",

        "text": "I always suspected my mom preferred my sister over me.  Growing up, she spoiled my sister with whatever she wanted and took her word over mine whenever we argued.  I was always in second place compared to her.  For example, when we turned sixteen, I was given my aunt's old clunker that ended up dying within six months.  When my sister turned sixteen, she got the brand new red Volkswagon of her dreams.  Mom said that I couldn't continue my piano lessons because they were getting so expensive while still supporting my sister's dance lessons, competions, etc.  \n\nThings got really bad about a decade ago.  When we were in high school, I feel in love with this guy, Joey, and started dating him for a while.  Only to for him to dump me because he preferred my sister.  Yes, my sister seduced him.  This really broke me because he was my first love.  \n\nWell, my sister and Joey ended up getting married after their college graduation.  And that is when things went from bad to worse.  Our mother had her will made and she was leaving everything to my sister.\n\nFor background information, our childhood home was a two story building, where my mother's flower shop was on the ground floor and the apartment we grew up in was the second floor.  While I didn't get along with my mom or sister, I loved that flower shop and had been working there for most of my life.  I dreamed of owning that shop one day.\n\nBut instead, my mother was going to leave the building, the shop and the apartment, to my sister.  While I could still work in the shop, my sister would be the owner and I would have to do what she says.  There was no use in trying to convince her to change her mind.  In her mind, my sister was the married one with a baby on the way.  She needed the business and house to raise her family.  Meanwhile, I was single and had nothing.\n\nSo, I cut them off.  If my mother didn't see me as a family member, then I wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  It was clear who she favored more.  So I moved out of my childhood home and was on my own.  Less than a year later, I joined the Peace Corps and have been living abroad since.\n\nNow, to the present.  After not hearing from them for years, my sister found me on social media and reached out to me.  She wanted to talk to me, rekindle whatever relationship we had.  I told her no, that I never wanted to talk to her or have anything to do with her or our mother again.  She then starts to write this angry message about how I could do this to her and why would I turn my back on her.\n\nBut as far as I am concerned,  she is not my family.  She hasn't been family in a decade.  My partner and our baby is family.  I have a new, happier, more fulfilling life in South Africa than I ever did back in the States.  I don't want to ever see my old family again because of how they treated me.  I don't want them to meet my daughter.  If I let them back into my life, I am afraid they will ruin the new life I made for myself.\n  \n\nAITA and being too harsh?\n\nEdit- Holy shit!  I am flabbergasted.  But for those who are guilding this post or are planning to, please donate your money to the Covid-19 first responders instead.",

My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.\n\n\nHe came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.\n\nHe yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying \"good riddance\"\n\n\n*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*\n\n\n*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

        "text": "I've always cleaned as I cook so that when it gets to the end of the meal, there's minimal mess. My husband is the opposite. When he cooks, it's like a bomb went off. I've encouraged him to clean as he cooks, and if we're doing a big meal/holiday meal together I often make sure to assign him that role.\n\nLike most people, one of us cooks, the other one cleans up. I am the better cook, so I cook like 80% of the time. He gets an easy cleanup.\n\nI'm busier than usual at work, so he's had to step up. Whenever he's done, the kitchen is a mess. I don't even get how it happens, there will be oil splatters untouched, stuff drying to dishes, peels and meat. I'm not about to let food sit out overnight so after I'm done eating I'll start the process and won't get to really relax much.\n\nLast week I asked if he could please try cleaning as he cooks. He told me \"the rule is one person cooks, the other person cleans.\" I said \"I get that but you're leaving me with a huge mess every night.\"\n\nHe said \"I just don't have the time to clean up when I'm focused on cooking\" knowing full well I'll see him scrolling on his phone.\n\nI just got so fed up, so on Sunday I made a big pot of chili. I didn't clean up as I worked, when I was done, I served him, sat down, enjoyed a beer and dinner.\n\nWhen he finally went into the kitchen, he said \"What the fuck? Why is there such a mess?\"\n\nI said that I was too busy paying attention to the chili to clean up. I started to get ready for bed. He was like, \"Uhh you're just going to leave this here?\" and I said yes. He said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a game with his friends later that night, so could I just clean up.\n\nI said no, I cooked, so he has to clean.\n\nTwo days later he's still pissy with me because he ended up not being able game and told me that he didn't get enough sleep and was exhausted at work (not to be TOO snarky, but it's not like he's a surgeon) because I had to \"prove a point\" to him. I told him that nothing else seemed to get his attention, and I feel pretty justified. He told me I was being a smug asshole about it and it was childish.\n\nAITA? Or is he?\n\n**EDIT:** A couple of people asked how we can make so many dishes, it should take 15 minutes, etc. We don't have a dishwasher (there's no room for one), so everything has to be done by hand. Additionally, \"doing the dishes\" means cleaning up the counters and stovetop and sweeping the floor, taking out the trash if need be.\n\nWhen I make chili, it's a process starting w/ dried chilies that I toast, soak, seed, pulverize, etc. Then there's cooking the dried beans, then there's the onions and garlic and the peels, any other veggies, seeding tomato, cans of tomato, grinding the spices, etc. Then there's grating cheese for the top, etc. It definitely left a ton of dishes and other stuff behind.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Sorry guys I was reading comments as I was at work, I thought this would get like... 10 comments tops. So another thing that comes up is \"whoever cooks also cleans\" but since I cook most of the time, I just don't see that as being also fair to me. I'll end up spending almost every single day after work (I've been ending work at 6 or 7 some days lately) cooking AND cleaning. If I had him cook more I would definitely start to gain weight and then we'd have another issue altogether HAHAHAHA.\n\n**FINAL EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Oh and sorry to the people on \"AmITheAngel\" for the \"humblebraggy\" way I mentioned I make chili. Didn't mean to make you guys feel inferior because I toasted a few chilies. Lmao. \"Oh it's so fishy because she used dried beans\" Makes sense why people are asking for my recipe if the concept of toasting chilies and using dried beans is so novel. Lmao.",

That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.\n\nMy mom doesn't like my husband. She thinks we both partied too much and she was hoping I'd grow up and do something \"respectable\" one day. She hates that he enables me to have the life she didn't want me to have. Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.\n\nMy mother was furious and I did know she would want me to lie or leave some details out,but it's my story to tell and I'm not ashamed of my life. My husband thinks I should have lied and said it was full on prostitution, but he's kind of an ass. My mom actually cried after dinner so AITA?",

Her explanation was that the other bathroom was busy and she just wanted to use the one in my bedroom. \n\nShe\u2019s involved roommate into this and he too thinks that I should apologise because I shouldn\u2019t have been walking around in my room naked without locking the door first. I\u2019ve refused to apologise. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "Me and my ex gf, Hayley, have one daughter 15F, Elle. \n\nI genuinely don't know if I was right to do what I did. \n\nAround 4 years ago, Hayley had a very bad accident. That ended with her being wheelchair bound. This caused her to develop a lot of resentment towards me. She would get angry if I worked out or played any sports. So, I stopped doing anything physical mostly. We tried counseling for a year and things didn't improve. In the end, we broke up. \n\nEver since Elle was born, I took out a private insurance for me, Elle and Hayley. This helped out a lot when she had her accident. Post break up, I still kept her in my insurance because she couldn't find any work and I knew if I dropped her from the insurance, she wouldn't be able to afford any treatments. \n\nIt's been 2 years since then. We have 50/50 custody, so I don't pay any child support. In the beginning, I kept a very keen eye to make sure that she didn't resent Elle like she resented me. She didn't, so I relaxed. She is still on that insurance because she is not able to find any job except wellfare. I wanted both Hayley and Elle to be well, so I kept the insurance. \n\nHalf a year ago when Elle came to stay, I noticed that  she was very depressed and had gotten very fat compared to before. Nothing overweight. But Elle does ballet and I have never seen her put on that much weight. Turns out Hayley forbade Elle from doing ballet because \"Hayley used to do ballet and Elle is just trying to rub her face in it\". The same for any physical activities like sports or exercising. With the quarantine, it must have been hell to live like that. Elle pretty much broke down and said that for the past few months, things have been escalating to the point that she is scared to walk inside her own house. She just stays in her room and comes out only to eat. Elle just begged me to go to court, so that I can get full custody. \n\nElle is at an age where her opinion matter in court, but it's almost impossible to get 100 percent custody in my state unless I can prove incompetency, according to my lawyer. \n\nSo, I dropped her from the insurance. Elle was supposed to stay with me for the next 6 months. Hayley couldn't get a job. She wiped out her savings as she had to pay for all her treatments. It was getting to the point that she couldn't even afford to get basic things for herself, let alone Elle. \n\nI also applied for sole custody. Given her financial situation and the pandemic and Elle's preference, the judge gave me full custody with supervised visitation for Hayley. Hayley didn't have a good representation at court due to her financial situation. Also, there is a pandemic going on. I left an already vulnerable person without any medical insurance. \n\nI know I did what i had to do to protect my child. But I did so by taking advantage of the medical expenses of a disabled woman. \n\nElle is happy. Hayley obviously thinks I am a manipulative bastard. Everyone seems to have mixed opinions. AITA here? \n\nAlso, dropping her from my insurance was completely legal. I am not from US.",

        "text": "My brother 'Fred' and his wife 'Sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'Katie' and I when they announced that they were pregnant. However, we kept it to ourselves. A few months ago, Katie planned a family trip. Brother and SIL decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. This greatly irked Katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that Fred and Sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. This very clearly upset both of them.\n\nUnfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. It has been a month, and my brother and SIL are understandably still devastated. Especially my SIL's mental health is not very well as of now.\n\nYesterday, I hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, SIL and our parents. Some time before dinner, SIL went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked Fred if she was doing well. Before Fred could reply, Katie jumped in and said, \"Well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. At least you don't have to worry about money anymore. As I said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.\"\n\nFred went red-faced and said that they WOULD have been able to provide for their child. They may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. He was almost crying and purple with anger, so I quickly dragged Katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.\n\nShe got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. It was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. By that time, Sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see Fred in tears. She kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. I knew that Katie's presence would ruin things further, and I asked her to get out. She looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.\n\nFortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. When they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at Katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps I shouldn't have kicked Katie out like this. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: For some more clarity, Katie is 24, so she ought to have enough maturity to know what to say.",

        "text": "I (27 F) got married a month ago. My dress was this long, lacy gown that my mom wore at her wedding. My mom passed away about 2 years ago. \n\nBecause the dress was so important to me, I had a big plan to keep it safe from any damages. I would only wear the dress at the wedding itself, and I would switch to a more casual dress for the reception. When I was wearing the dress, I wouldn\u2019t eat or drink anything except water, and I would stay inside at all times.\n\nI promise I\u2019m not usually this crazy about cleanliness, but this was my mom\u2019s dress, and the thought of it being damaged broke my heart. But I also knew I wanted to wear it when I got married to have a piece of her with me. She adored this dress and always dreamed I would wear it. \n\nMy bridesmaids knew very well about my particularities with the dress. I had a room above the venue where I was getting ready. My dress was hanging in a safe place in the room. \n\nOn the day of the wedding, I went down to check on something for the wedding, leaving my bridesmaids in the room. Here\u2019s what happened, as they told it to me:\n\nThey opened a bottle of Pinot Noir (my favorite) as a celebration. They poured themselves glasses and began to walk around checking out the room. One of my bridesmaids, \u201cAnna,\u201d (27 F) wanted to get a closer look at my dress. She got really close to it, and she started touching the lace. Somehow, her hand holding the wine glass slipped, and wine spilled all over the bottom of the dress. \n\nWhen I came upstairs, they told me what happened, and I started sobbing. My maid of honor called several professional cleaners, and they said there was no way they could get the dress in before the wedding. They told us ways to save the dress until we could get it into them, so my MOH started doing that.\n\nAfter that call, I became extremely angry. I asked \u201cAnna\u201d what the hell she was doing holding red wine so close to my dress when she knew how careful I was being. She dismissed it and said it wasn\u2019t such a big deal because I was planning to wear the dress, so it could have gotten damaged that way too. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe she said that. I called her thoughtless and careless and stupid. I told her that she was no longer part of the wedding and that I wanted her to leave. She left, and neither of us have reached out to the other since. \n\nI got married in the dress I had planned to wear for the reception, and I was heartbroken not to be wearing my mom\u2019s dress. After the wedding, my bridesmaids joked that I was a bridezilla for kicking \u201cAnna\u201d out after she made a \u201chonest mistake.\u201d \n\nI absolutely don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH or a bridezilla because Anna\u2019s reaction was so horrible and insincere. But I wanted to get the story off my chest and ask some people who might be more impartial, AITA?",

        "text": "We all go through phases and pick up annoying habits, and sometimes we just need our loved ones to gently tell us if we've picked up a particularly egregious habit.\n\nSometime in the last year, my husband has picked up a habit where he talks like a baby. At first it was funny, but passed into embarrassing, cringeworthy behavior quickly.\n\nExamples: doggo, pupper, woofer/subwoofer, pibble, hooty-boy, peepo, birb, meowmeow, sammy, sammiches, sammywhammy, chicky nuggies, chicky tendies, adding a toddleresque \"lisp\" to words, and the ones that really get gross are childish euphemisms for genitalia or sex.\n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: it is not endearing or sexy to have my husband talk about my \"boobies\" and his \"weiner\" and \"weenie\" and \"wee wee\", \"hoohas\" and \"bajingos\" (Nostalgia for Scrubs be damned). We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my \"boobies\" and it makes me sick.\n\nJust before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a \"chicky sammy\" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the \"joke\" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?\n\nAfter that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say \"Me wanty 'nother beer!\" or something.\n\nI don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling \"ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!\"\n\nI was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me. He kept going and kept saying \"CAN WE GET POPSICOOOS?\" and I just said \"Either talk to me like an adult or I'm leaving.\"\n\nHe started saying OOOOOO YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES and LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.\n\nSince then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for \"CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.\"\n\nHe got his fucking Mom involved, no joke. She keeps telling me it's just a phase and that he's probably bored and I should be happy this is his midlife crisis, rather than him fucking 19 year olds at the local bar.\n\nI'm going crazy. AITA? Do I really just need to let my husband continuously embarrass me like this?\n\n**Edit:** Sorry, there was only so much space. I *have* talked to him. Multiple times. Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like \"boobies\" and \"wee wee\" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.\n\n**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. \n\n**Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its \"cute\" to embarrass each other. \n\n**Is this a kink/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)\n\n**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.\n\n**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.\n\n**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.\n\n**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on.",

She did, however, get drunk and pee in some bushes. No one in her family was surprised to hear about that.\n\n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i5eqfx/aita_for_telling_my_fiancee_that_if_her_cousin/\n\n\nWell everyone, a lot has happened in the last few weeks. Nicole's cousin and fiance have announced their wedding date...two weeks after ours. \n\nIt came down to a comment I made in front of Nicole's twin sister (Brittany). Amber had announced their engagement, and said that they were getting married in October, but no specific date. The three of us were chatting about things when Brittany brought up the announcement and mentioned how it seemed they were trying to steal the spotlight again, and I muttered about them even stealing the wedding day. Nicole had said she talked to Brittany about it, and she had, but didn't tell her they were doing it on the same day.\n\nBrittany lost her mind about it. She three-way called Amber and Amber's mom and read them the riot act. It was both glorious, and extremely uncomfortable to listen to. There's a lot of...stuff...between those parts of the families. Brittany told them they had a week to figure out when in October they were getting married other than our wedding day, or she would tell everyone in the family what they were trying to do.\n\nAmber's mom tried to downplay it all, but Brittany wasn't having any of it. Even though she's about 5 minutes older than Nicole, she was acting like she was a much older protective sister. It was a long phone call, but in the end they figured the jig was up. A few days later they announced the date, but since Amber's fiance lost his job, and their families can't afford a traditional wedding, they're only inviting a small portion of their original guest list, and having a zoom wedding.\n\nLuckily, we don't get back from our honeymoon until the day after their wedding. Shucks!",

        "text": "My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn\u2019t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn\u2019t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nAfter the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn\u2019t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.\n\nThings got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.\n\nThe conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn\u2019t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I\u2019ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we\u2019re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.\n\nSo I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can\u2019t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife\u2019s parents, her sister, and my mom.\n\nA lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?",

        "text": "If I\u2019m the AH here, I\u2019ll own it.  I\u2019m not sorry, but like it would be good to know because the rest of my family thinks this went too far.\n\nMy (24F) mom died when I was 7 from leukemia. I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn\u2019t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me. My grandmother put them all in a book for me after she died.  I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I\u2019ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.\n\nMy father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the \u201cI\u2019m your mom now\u201d and my father didn\u2019t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then. Unfortunately he got cancer when he was 3. And I pretty much ceased to exist for my father, he was either working or gone with my brother and I spent all my teen years mostly at home alone or with my grandparents. The mantra was that my brother needed to be the focus because he might die so I needed to not be selfish since I was healthy. I stopped trying to talk to him when I was 16 and it was a dark time.  I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.\n\nMy grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom\u2019s collages where she had written \u201cRemember that your dad and I are always here for you\u201d and I wrote \u201cYou failed. Go away.\u201d underneath. I felt like him being able to see it from my literal perspective would communicate why I don\u2019t want him back better than I could.\n\nEvidently it worked, but a little too well because I\u2019ve been bombarded by family telling me that it\u2019s understandable that I don\u2019t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he\u2019s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.\n\nMaybe it was, I know my bar for that is kind of weird sometimes, so AITA?\n\nEdit - A couple of follow up notes, since it came up the comments:\n\n1.  I loved my brother.  I don\u2019t resent him.  He was a good kid and I wish he was still with us.  None of this is his fault, to me it is completely my father\u2019s and to a lesser extent step-mother\u2019s. The parents prevented me from spending time with him as he got sicker so I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to be there for him even if I had been able to (which I wasn\u2019t towards the end because I was also struggling to stay alive).\n\n2.  I have empathy.  I understand what my father lost, I was there.  I also lost those same people plus effectively my father.  Even so, to me there is no excuse for completely shutting your own kid completely out of your life while also preventing them from getting any kind of help.  I understand depression and freezing up, I\u2019ve been there, and I still even not being an adult managed to consider the impact of my behavior on other people.  If he was that bad off, he should have given me up to be raised by someone else.  My mom\u2019s parents asked and he wouldn\u2019t agree to let me stay with them full time.  I could have had a dad that was able to occasionally tell me he loved me even if it was just a text message.  Alternatively, I could have lived with my grandparents and had people around me who cared about me every day even if that wasn\u2019t my father.  I got neither and every request for help of any kind was met with \u201csuck it up\u201d.  I can empathize with having to function while breaking down inside, but I can\u2019t empathize with what he did.\n\n3.  I gather from relatives (who have backed off after some hard boundary setting) that my father and step-mother split not long ago and are in divorce proceedings, which is why he reached out now and why the rest of the family was upset with how I responded at the time - he wasn\u2019t in a good place already.  I\u2019ve told them that if they care about him to encourage him to keep away from me, refuse to pass on any messages, and try to get him into inpatient care or something if they\u2019re that worried he\u2019s going to do something rash.  I don\u2019t want anything to do with him and I\u2019ve told them that I don\u2019t want to hear about anything that happens after this point, but the rest of his family love him so for their sake I hope he pulls himself together.",

My husband work night shifts-3 nights a week so he's usually sleeping at home during the day. He got himself a ps5 a month ago. He started spending time playing. He used to handle some of the house chorus now all he does is make excuses of how tired he is and how much he needs sleep. But he'd come home from his shift and starts playing. He drinks a lot of coffee to stay concentrated and awake. Also he stopped eating properly. Keeps forgetting to do things I ask him to do. Like help fix his daughter's toys/take turns in changing diapers etc.\n\nI started calling my mom to come help since he's been too busy to do simple things. He didn't like that I asked others for help and said I didn't have to. That he'll start helping again. I actually believed him and left for my 8 hour shift at the hospital and before I left I reminded him of everything he needed to do from feeding/changing diapers/cleaning our daughter's room etc. He said \"don't worry about it\" and then I left.\n\nI called him to check on the kids and he said everything was fine. I came home in the evening and I was shocked to see our 6 months old's bed was put in the living room. Her stuff on the couch. While he was playing. She didn't stop crying he said he didn't know what was wrong. Turned out he didn't change the diaper after I left. She was wearing the same diaper for 9 hours. He said he forgot but he was busy playing. I immediately took care of her. I knew her rash was going to get worse after that. My 6 year old's hair was a mess he didn't brush her hair. The kitchen was a mess. I was livid kept yelling at him for being neglectful and reckless and literally forgetting about his own kids over a game.\n\nHe said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for not reminding him on the phone. I told him it was my fault for leaving the kids with someone who doesn't even brush his teeth. He got offended and left the house minutes later.\n\nHis mom called me telling me that my husband stayes up at night to make a living for his kids and that I was pressuring him by giving him more than he could handle. I tried to explain but she kept lashing out calling me controlling and said I might be frustrated from my job that's why \"I'm taking it out on him\".\n\nI hung up on her and had to take care of all of that mess.\n\nSorry for any mistakes I'm just so exhausted.",

However, one thing I don\u2019t agree with is how my family has handled it. We\u2019re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can\u2019t come to family events that she\u2019ll attend. She won\u2019t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. \n\nI got pregnant last year. I told Julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. I said I understood. The first hurdle came with my baby shower. My MIL was throwing it. I didn\u2019t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn\u2019t have one period, \u201cout of respect\u201d. I said that was ridiculous. She didn\u2019t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.\n\nWhen my son was born, I posted a birth announcement on Facebook. My parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt Julie. I said she could just block or mute me. They said I should make the effort. Julie echoed that if I cared, I\u2019d stop. I ended up blocking her just to save drama. \n\nMy aunt\u2019s 70th birthday party is next week. My husband and I planned to go, bringing our son. Julie called and asked if we were going. She then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. I said no. She doesn\u2019t want to miss the party. My aunt is one of the few people who agree that Julie\u2019s boundaries aren\u2019t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn\u2019t get to see him often. Julie got upset and started crying, saying that I was unfair. \n\nI finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? Would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she\u2019s refused to give other people\u2019s kids? Will her baby be allowed to attend events? She said that was different. I said no, I\u2019m not coddling her anymore. My son exists, he\u2019s family and he\u2019s coming. She can decide if she wants to or not.\n\nMy parents yelled at me for being mean to Julie. They offered to pay for a sitter but I said no. It\u2019s not even her house. AITA?",

The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). \n\nBoyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to \"accept\" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. \n\n\nFast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's \"hers\" and \"you already bought it\". I told her that it wasn't hers since she refused to accept the gift and that I'm not going to give it \"back\" to her. She got upset and complained to my boyfriend who told her it was up to me whether or not I wanted to give her the gift anymore. \n\nAm I being too harsh on her? My sister thinks I'm just making my own life more difficult by not just giving it to her. Is it petty of me? AITA for refusing to give a gift that I did buy for her?\n\n**Edit: ok, I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Just to clarify a few things that are being asked, I'm 27. No, this is not the first time I've got them gifts. I didn't write down my thought process properly; I've got them gifts before but they were \"experiences\" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a \"proper\" gift that they can actually keep and immediately \"have\" if that makes sense. And yes I kept it for myself, what else am I supposed to do with a rejected gift?** \n\n**Anyway..I realise that I did not handle this in the best way. I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her). Thanks for all the ideas as to how to approach her and this conversation. And yes I understand that she is still dealing with her parents breaking up and I feel for her, I really do.**",

        "text": "So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she\u2019s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. \n\nFor financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and \u201cyeah yeahed\u201d me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. \n\nI\u2019ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I\u2019m hired. I talked to my partner and he\u2019d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.\n\nKids would be cut off. I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they\u2019d have to grow up and fast.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I do this?",

        "text": "My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",

        "text": "\n\nSo for context my f29 boyfriend m34 is a doctor, Most of his friends are from work and they all seem to dislike me and act distant maybe cause I'm not a doctor too? Idk and don't care honestly, since we started dating they've been asking to hang out without me and they leave any event I'm at. My boyfriend said they're just taking their time to get used to me.\n\n\nAnyways, His B-day was days ago, I'd arranged for the party and paid for everything. It wasn't a surprise since the party was held at the restaurant, and he needed heads up so he could invite his doctor friends.\n\n\nWe got there then his friends started arriving, They came to greet him and started shaking his hand and hugging him while completely ignoring me though I was there next to him!.\n\nThe tension started when one of them started making remarks about the way I dressed, I sucked it up but another friend started interrogating me about my degree then implying I was an ignorant for my food choice (wtf?). An hour later another one asked if I could leave because they wanted to discuss work stuff and it's confidential. I was so shocked I laughed asking why he thought it was appropriate to discuss work during a party and he replied that I had an \"attitude\". An argument ensued and they 'demanded' that I leave but I said absolutely not, My boyfriend finally spoke up after it escalated and asked that I keep the peace and go home but I refused and reminded him and let his friends know that I'd arranged for this party and paid for it and so they should leave since they're just \"guests\". He pulled me aside and begged I go home after they said if I don't leave then they will but I still refused. They left, all of them and the party was cut short. my boyfriend was upset and started complaining at home that I ruined his B-day the minute I started arguing with his friends. I told him they were being dusrespectful to me but he said I was wrong too cause they said they wanted to discuss medical stuff and I should've respected that and not made it \"personal\".\n\n\nHe's not speaking to me now, I was so hurt I couldn't argue anymore, I felt like I ruined his birthday by making a scene like he said and acting pass-aggressive.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit to say that the reaaon I refused to leave was because I figured they used the \"medical stuff discussion\" as an excuse to get me to leave early.",

        "text": "Last weekend I (F27) ended feeling a wee bit poorly with what turned out to be appendicitis. We were away for the w/e with my partner (M39) so I had surgery at a hospital 3-4h away from home. I had a small complication during surgery so I had to stay until Wednesday (yesterday). My partner returned work on Monday but he came back to pick me up.\n\nThe timing was a bad because there was an important football game yesterday and it was really important for my partner to watch it. I am not English so I don't quite 'get' the importance but it's a big deal for him and so important, I wanted to make sure he'd see the game. I suggested booking a room near the hospital so we wouldn't miss it due to the drive but he wanted to see the game at a friend's place. He said he'd make it.\n\nWhile we were waiting to get me discharged he was getting agitated because it was taking a long time. He had to wait outside so he was in his car the whole time because of restrictions at the hospital. After a couple of hours he sent me a text that he had to leave or he'd miss the game. I begged him to not leave and reminded I could book a hotel. But he left without me, and luckily made it on time to see the start of the game. He said he'd come pick me up tomorrow (today) instead. \n\nThe hospital wouldn't let me stay another night or leave alone. Luckily, one of my friends came to get me in the end. She didn't get to the hospital until late and we got back to London around 2am. The whole time I was trying to call and text my partner but he only said we could talk about it today. \n\nThe whole evening I was texting and calling my partner, ever since the moment he left me at the hospital. He only sent me one whatsapp back that said he'd pick me up later but wanted to see the game. When I got home in the night he was so angry at me. He said I was the most selfish asshole for constantly ringing and texting him during the game and that I ruined the game for him and embarrassed him infront of his friends. He said he cannot even look at me and that I bring so much drama with me it's humiliating to him. I feel at complete loss. I think I might be the asshole for not understanding the cultural significance of football and asking my bf to do a completely unreasonable drive to pick me up. But on the other hand we could have watched the game in a hotel room and I wouldn't have been left alone in a hospital in another country. AITA?",

I would be happy to do this if we were married, but we\u2019re not. We\u2019ve only been dating for a year and a half, and I would prefer to keep our finances separate.

        "text": "I (36F) have a daughter Sadie (12) with my ex-husband John (39). We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.\n\nI have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. \n\nWell, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.\n\nThe problem came when I went to pick her up last weekend.I had a business meeting and couldn't drive her over, so Amanda offered to just pick Sadie up from school, which hadn't happened before. When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.\n\nThey sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.\n\nI told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.\n\nThey've been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me a selfish AH, and after telling the story to a friend, he told me I was rubbing my success in their face, but I still don't feel like I did anything wrong. Still, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I got temporary guardianship while waiting for a court hearing. We're going to try to get full custody and have John get one day a week of visitation, supervised for at least the first few months, and no contact with Amanda or her kids.This way, he still sees Sadie just as much and they can try to repair their relationship, but she doesn't have to go back there. All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back. I've talked to Sadie and we've decided that she's going to try therapy for a little while to help deal with everything that's happened.\n\nUPDATE: We've had the hearing and our custody arrangement's been modified. Any and all decisions relating to Sadie are made by me, and me alone. John has supervised visitation once a week, and Sadie will continue in therapy to deal with all the issues Amanda and co. have caused her. \n\nThey tried to push for 50/50 custody split on grounds of alienation (so me trying to put Sadie against her father), but we made it clear from the start that we wanted to keep Amanda and her children away, and wanted supervision only because we don't feel safe leaving him alone as of yet, but that we were open to modifications. Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. \n\nAmanda's pissed, and has tried to contact me and Sadie, but I made it clear to her that if she keeps harrassing me or my daughter, I'll have to make this known to the authorities. Sadie and I have blocked her everywhere, and any communication between John and us is made through text messages or emails only. \n\nI'd like to thank you all for your support throughout all of this, it really means a lot to us. Sending you loads of love!",

        "text": "\nI'm just going to be direct and quick. \n\nI (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019 \n\nNow I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together. \n\nThis past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying \"I told you so I told you so\" then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too \"afraid\" to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours. \n\nMom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just \"spouting nonesense\". I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually.\n\n\nI later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down. \n\nMy mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that.\n\n\nETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes.\n\n\nThank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem \"originally\". It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.",

I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn\u2019t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don\u2019t have that kind of relationship, we\u2019re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I\u2019m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?",

What if I had to get tested for HIV for a more personal reason? What if somebody who knew me was in the waiting area and heard I was getting tested? \n\nShe apologized but I told her I will be calling her manager and informing them of the incident.

It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.\n\nWhen I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8\", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).\n\nWell it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.\n\nI currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.\n\nWhile doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.\n\nAfter repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.\n\nI refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.\n\nNow she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?",

        "text": "My ex and I divorced three years ago. She was cheating, but at this point I don\u2019t care about the relationship anymore. The pending lawsuit has nothing to do with her or him, but rather their actions. \n\nMy ex and I have a son 13m that we split time with 50/50. He\u2019s a great kid that interests have changed a lot tbh as I imagine more kids/teenagers tend to do through the years. \n\nOne thing my son was heavily into at some point was legos. He use to play with them all the time, and personally I think they\u2019re a great toy for different reasons. I use to love playing them with him, and to this day I still collect boxes that I leave unopened as a collection.\n\nWell when my ex and I divorced she got with someone who loved legos more I guess? From what I know he loves making creations and building the sets in. I don\u2019t care.. seems cool. He does one thing I think is very very weird.. He uses crazy glue so the sets can\u2019t break or pieces can\u2019t be lost. It seems so weird to me. \n\nThe issue is, I was out of town for all of three days last week for medical reasons, and my son wanted to get his ps4 so he could play it at his moms. This isn\u2019t out of the ordinary at all and he has a key, so he let me know he would be stopping over for it. I told him to have fun when I saw him on the entry camera. My wife\u2019s husband was with him which was a no-no. I told him via speaker to not go in and to wait on the porch. \n\nHe flinched but walked in any way. I sent my ex a text telling her to call him and tell him he\u2019s one minute away from a cop call. He left my home with a bag in hand which I didn\u2019t think much of because my son had his games too. \n\nWell my son texted me later that evening and said he didn\u2019t know it at the time but he\u2019s pretty sure SD took some of my sets. These are all old sets and two are worth big money. When I got home I confirmed the missing sets and called my ex. She had no idea but he admired he took them but it was so son could have the sets to complete his collection... my son doesn\u2019t even like legos anymore and told his mom he wouldn\u2019t steal from me. \n\nMy wife asked how much it would cost to replace them and unfortunately it\u2019s more than their savings. Actually, it would take their house down payment plus more. I told them if they didn\u2019t pay in two weeks I was suing and pressing charges. The price in the sets makes it a felony. \n\nMy ex and her husband are saving for a house which would give my son more space when he\u2019s there, but those sets were going help pay for his education someday or a home of his own. I filed the police report and have talked to a lawyer and we\u2019re moving forward with the suit.\n\nEveryone is calling me a joke because they are just toys, but I don\u2019t get it. They are worth real money.. I\u2019m not rich guys. I needed those to help with my sons future... but again taking this money does deny my son things at his moms house.\n\nAITA here??\n\nEdit* I\u2019ve been asked to add these facts.\n\nThe sets have been opened which more than half their worth, and one was glued together. The damage was done already. \n\nThe stolen items are: \n\nKings Castle  \nMilk truck \nLego land train \nCarousel\nAnd the glued one was a Star Wars snow speeder.\n\nSome of these are one piece of a larger set. So if you lose one of five, you lose the value of one produce plus the value of the set as a whole.\n\nSecond edit*\n\nEx wife and boyfriend are the same as ex boyfriend.. I\u2019m just a bad writer.\n\nThird/final edit for this post*\n\nI know I haven\u2019t been here much but I have read many of your comments and taken them to heart. I know my spelling is poor guys, and I apologize for the format. Calling me names in my private message was not called for, and I am not a scalper. I enjoy buying these sets and do not intend to sell all of them, but I want my son to go to college and not worry about debt, so I want to sell the ones that I can to help. I never had the smarts for higher education but my son is not me, and I love him and want him to do better. \n\nAround 4:00 PM I called the local state police and met at their facility. I gave them all I had and gave my statement. \n\nMy son is with me starting tonight so when I picked him up I sent him into GameStop and called his mom. I told her I had filed charges and I asked the cop to call me when everything was done so I could give him the opportunity to turn himself in. I wanted to be better than he treated me. I\u2019ll save her reaction for a real update btw\u2014- can someone please tell me how to update because I don\u2019t really understand the steps in the main notes. \n\nI told my son when we got home what I did and why.\nMy son said that I did the right thing because he didn\u2019t want his step dad to think it was ok to do it again, and if he didn\u2019t go to jail he\u2019d rather be her away from him so it isn\u2019t weird.",

My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn\u2019t Catholic and wouldn\u2019t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn\u2019t know there. He\u2019d think it\u2019s way too fancy, way too much. \n\nHe and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201d \n\nTo remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren\u2019t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, \n\nThis morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn\u2019t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. \n\nI also reached out to some of my brother\u2019 s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we\u2019re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.\n\nThanks again.",

I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with dog shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said \" Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!\" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. AITA or am I a diabolical genius?",

        "text": "Throw away because some of my friends know my reddit account and I want to keep this as private as possible. Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.\n\nI am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (\"Im an adult OP, I can do what I want\"). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a \"bullet dodged\" party. \n\nHe had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because \"Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill.\" \u2026.. right. \n\nI was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words \"pack your shit and get the fuck out\" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, \"all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.\"\n\nHere's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.\n\nso reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: so I didn\u2019t think this would get as much traction. I\u2019ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don\u2019t care what your views on abortion are, or how you don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for her pregnancy. So please do not comment if you\u2019re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.\n\nEDIT 2: I cam currently trying to track the girl down. She is an old work colleague of his, and Im trying to find his old coworkers to figure out her contact info and see if I can help in any way.",

        "text": "28 years ago my wife and I combined our savings (most of which came from inheritance after my father's passing) and bought our \"castle\" in southern Europe. It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.\n\nIt took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.\n\nOur only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. \n\nRecently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.\n\nI was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for \"us all to get to the villa\".\n\nMy wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. \n\nI slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's \"family property\" which is obviously ridiculous. \n\nETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused",

They're rich and are all about image. I only see them on occasions but that's when the drama is at it's highest rate. Last Christmas Ted & I traveled to spend Xmas with them and it was awkward for some reason. After we went back to the hotel his mom sent me a list of all the things I've done wrong at her house like bringing wrong types of desserts and wearing \"inappropriate\" clothes (um I wore a blouse and leather jacket) and not standing up when guests arrived.\n\n\nThis year mother inlaw only sent an invitation to Ted to spend xmas with family. He told me his mom didn't invite me because of my last year's \"negative points\" and would rather have just him there this year. I was flabbergasted I asked if he was actually considering going after his mom excluded me and he shrugged and said yes because he never spent xmas away from family his entire life and isn't \"about to break the cycle now\". He suggested I go out, invite Regina (my best friend) over or just plan my own celebration and said \"but nothing too crazy, capeesh?\". I was upset but hey! if they don't want me then I shouldn't force it and tried to not feel hurt and offended.\n\nYesterday Ted came home asking if his bags were ready since it was time to go. I said I don't know and he was stunned. he freaked out saying I knew he was going to travel to his hometown and I should've packed his bags like I always do. I admit that packing his bags is what I do but ONLY WHEN WE'RE TRAVELING TOGETHER and I figured since he was traveling on his own then he should pack them himself. He lost it saying I just caused him to be late and ruined all the (flight/hotel/other reservations) arrangements he had just because I was being bitter because I wasn't invited to xmas celebration with his family. We had a heated argument and he said \"Look, you're really overreacting right now because it's not like I'm going away on a vacation to another country to spend time with some strippers and whatnot though I'm pretty certain you wouldn't be as half pissed and agitated as you are now. I'm just going to spend time with my family and quite frankly, I don't know what it is with you anymore\". Then proceeded to call me petty and say I got him in trouble and \"punished\" him by not packing his bags for him knowing he was going to travel.\n\n\nHe packed his bags in a rush and ended up forgetting most of the gifts he got for his family. He's now not speaking to me. AITA?\n\nETA: I found out that it's not just my mother inlaw but father inlaw and Ted's brothers figured it would be best that I don't attend their xmas and instead go to my own family claiming they were giving me the options to decide and also they claimed they don't want to force me to be with them since we have some tension between us.\n\nETA2: Ted said this is all temprarily until his family and I get used to and adapt with each others.",

My in laws were meant to come by around 6pm, and instead came by over an hour early and let themselves in with the spare key. I was sleeping on the sofa with my son on my chest, they got an eyeful. I woke up to them yelling at me to put a shirt on and asking why I didn't do that sooner if I knew they'd be over today. I maintain that they were a full hour early and why on earth would they just let themselves in when I didn't answer the door. My boyfriend wants me to apologise, I refuse. Who's the arsehole here?\n\nEdit: to everyone commenting about the sleeping situation as being a risk of suffocation/SIDS please know that I am fully aware of this and am taking all measures to avoid any injury/death of my child, this was a one off event after he fell asleep on top of me and we napped for less than an hour, probably closer to half an hour. I appreciate the concern but this is the only time it's happened and it won't be happening again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I am aware of how the votes on here are shaping up but they are the only people I have close by rn. My boyfriend is mad at me for making things awkward, and my in laws are annoyed by what they saw, so I just called them and apologised. Going forward I will assume they will be early and not nap/be shirtless on days they are coming in case they arrive ahead of time.",

        "text": "My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they\u2019ve never don\u2019t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they\u2019ve only dated for a little more than a year. \n\nI told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.\n\nThe problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn\u2019t have to work at all during the school year. \n\nSince I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.\n\nShe now says that she\u2019s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she\u2019s not going to school, she\u2019d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.\n\nI told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she\u2019s married, I\u2019ll be happy to contribute the money. But it\u2019s not just a free handout.\n\nShe\u2019s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he\u2019s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fianc\u00e9, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.\n\nWell we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don\u2019t want her to think I support this decision.\n\nShe told me she sorta saw my point, but she\u2019s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she\u2019s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she\u2019s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",

This means that our bodies are pretty much covered (this is important).\n\nA new dude has joined our gym recently - I saw him in a class but did not roll with him. Last week I attended a no Gi class and the coach pairs me up with new guy. New guy wears a sleeveless rash guard, lots of tattoos on both arms and legs. I look at this tattoos and there is a big black swastika on his arm. As I take a closer look there is also the SS symbol - the one that looks like thunder bolts. Some other symbols here and there as well like the Celtic Cross.\n\nI tell my coach that I want to be paired up with someone else. Coach finds me a new partner but after the class asks me what is wrong. I tell him that the guy has lots of Nazi tattoos and I don't roll with Nazis. Now the coach is mad at me for bringing politics into the gym. \n\nI told my coach that he is bringing politics into the gym by allowing a guy to walk around with a swastika on his arm. Some guys from the class are behind me, some think I am making a big deal out of it \n\nAITA for refusing to roll with a Nazi?\n\nEdit for clarification: Not in the USA. Where I come from (Europe) there are still Nazi sympathisers - a minority but a vocal minority. Also you can easily roll with a long sleeved rash guard, the climate here allows it no need for no sleeves.",

        "text": "[First post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mf7ca8/aita_for_deactivating_my_nieces_social_media_when/) Short version is I let my 13 year old niece, who I adopted, have social media. She went against my conditions for having it, so I asked her to take an internet safety course, which she faked attending. When I realised she faked it I had her delete all of her social media. She told my mother, who called me a controlling and unreasonable arsehole, saying my niece knew what she was doing.\n\nIt's been a few days. I read through every comment on my original post, and saw all your feedback, particularly the parts about my niece being unlikely to trust me after this.\n\nI sat my niece down one final time. I talked to her again about all the information she wanted to add, trying to explain again why it was a bad idea to put her full name, her date of birth, location, and whatever else online. She still didn't believe that it could be dangerous.\n\nSo I asked her what information she wanted to put exactly. She told me. I googled it. The entire first page of results was all about her, or my sister (her mother), or me. It showed her school website, as she's been mentioned in the newsletter. Her full name also brought up her personal phone number, and a website for details of the adoption. I then showed her what was linked with my name, despite my very careful social media presence. The results included a background check website that listed all my former names, my number, my address (where we currently live), and more behind a paywall.\n\nShe now completely understands what I was trying to tell her. We worked out a new deal. She's allowed social media, but instead of all the information she wanted to add she's only allowed her star sign and that she's a minor. She can give a location but it has to be our county, not our town. Her profile will be on private and she can only link up with people she knows IRL. I will follow her from a fake account, so her friends don't see her aunt on her friend lists. These restrictions will lessen in due time. If she does anything to screw it up, it all gets deactivated again, and we won't even revisit the topic of social media until she's 15.\n\nAs for my mother, I called her and told her to back off. I said that I have custody of my niece, so I make the decisions, and mum doesn't get to make that harder for me. That if she really thought my niece putting her full name, date of birth, location, etc, online was safe, she's an idiot, and it pisses me off that the only times I hear from her, it's so she can tell me that I'm doing something wrong, when she herself was given the chance to adopt my niece and refused. Mum essentially said that she can't believe I'd treat her like this and I shouldn't expect to hear from her for a while.",

I packed my important belongings (Ex. Passport, clothes) and arranged with my best friend to crash at his apartment until I can find my own. Usually when small issues happen in a relationship, it ties into a bigger issue of that relationship. The main reason why I decided to break up is because I realized that her friends will always be closer to her than me. Sarah has favored her friends over me and blown off some of our plans for her friends more than once. I was lying to myself for years because I didn\u2019t want to face reality yet. I had hoped she would change, but this trip really opened my eyes that I will always be in 3rd place to her.I expressed my feelings multiple times, and Sarah promised she would change, and she didn\u2019t.\n\nSarah came home late yesterday. I said I have a lot to get off my chest and I want to get through my notes before she talks or tries to interrupt me. The first question I asked Sarah was \u201cHow she thought the trip went\u201d. She said we all had fun and it was memorable. I shouldn\u2019t have to feel like the 3rd wheel in my own relationship, especially on a trip that I planned.\n\nMy next question was \u201cWhy did you invite your friends in the first place? You knew this was an anniversary trip for US\u201d. She talked about the trip with her friends since the beginning, and they never been to CO. She thought it would be a good idea to allow them to come just so they can have fun in CO with us. I followed up with my lack of knowledge of her friends coming along until days before. It\u2019s one thing if they came and did their OWN activities. But it\u2019s another thing that every activity became a group activity. I signed up for a monogamous, not poly relationship.\n\nMy last question was \u201cDid you know that I was going to propose to you?\u201d. Sarah said she didn\u2019t know at all. The thought never occurred to Sarah that I was going to ask. She claimed that she wouldn\u2019t have invited her friends to come along if she knew, but I responded that \u201cit would ruin the surprise if I told you\u201d.\n\nSarah begged me to stay with her and believes we can work everything out. She didn\u2019t want me to throw 5 years away after this one bad trip. I listened to her promises to change for years regarding her friends, but nothing happened. I ultimately left Sarah with this: it\u2019s clear that there isn\u2019t enough room in your heart for your BF and your friends. As much as I love Sarah, I can\u2019t stay in a relationship where I\u2019m not respected enough. I left Sarah in the house by herself and I drove off to my friend\u2019s place.\n\nI\u2019ll figure out how to get my name off the lease and I\u2019ll plan to get the rest of my belongings. As for the ring, I will return it this weekend.",

I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it. \n\nI was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",

The right side and the bottom half of my face is completely normal. \n\nI have big side bangs that hide the left side of my face so I don't freak anyone out and I don't get weird looks. I've been going to the same school since I was 5, so the teachers and the kids know about it. \n\nWe got a new teacher this week. He started by asking us to go around and introduce ourself. When it got to me, he was rude and asked me \"do your parents know you come to school looking like this? It's extremely disrespectful, fix your bangs, I want to see your face!\" \n\nSo I obeyed and tucked my bangs behind my ear, showing the left side of my face. He gasped, his face turned red, my classmates laughed and he told me that I can let my bangs down. \n\nLater that day, my head teacher came to me to scold me.

I just obeyed his orders, it's not my fault he ended up not wanting to look at my face. AITA?\n\n-----\nUpdate:\n\nMy mom went in to talk to the head teacher.

It\u2019s important to know that he\u2019s been unemployed since 2021. He receives benefits. It\u2019s also important to know that he\u2019s extremely lazy. He doesn\u2019t cook, clean, or help out in any way. I was nervous about leaving her home with her father but I had no choice. \nWhen I came back from work she was clean, and sleeping. The next few times I came home he was either playing with her, feeding her, or out for a walk with her. I was happy. A few days ago my neighbor told me that as soon as I leave the baby cries and she cries for hours. My neighbor said that she knocked on our door and he finally answered it. He was sleeping. \nI concluded that he sleeps all day and right. Before I come home he pretends to care for her. I decided to take the day off of work, i left home at my regular time. Waited 30 minutes and then went home. Sure enough he was knocked out sleep with his stupid noise cancelling headphones on. \nI went to my daughters room, scooped her up and took her to my friends house. I waited about 2hours and I finally called him to tell him that I was coming home early. He called me back saying that he can\u2019t find the baby. He told me that he was going to call the police but before he did I told him what I did. He called me an asshole and a lot of other words too. When I got home his mother was there \u201ccalming his nerves\u201d because he has a panic attack. She also called me an asshole. My husband decided to sleep at her house. Family members are telling me that I\u2019m a terrible person. I know that it was extreme but I don\u2019t know if I would consider myself to be an asshole \n\n\n*English isn\u2019t my native language sorry about the grammar\n\n\nUpdate\u2014\u2014-sorry I created this account just to post my story I\u2019m not a big Reddit user. I missed so many wonderful messages from people. The last few days have been crazy. Once I finally told everyone what happened many took my side. My ex-husband and mother in law still think I\u2019m a jerk. \nMy friend allowed my daughter and I to move in with her. Which is nice, we were living in a bad area before so this can be a fresh start. My ex-husband has not asked to see my daughter for the past week. Online he\u2019s saying how I ruined his youth by trapping him with a baby. \nIdc anymore I\u2019m in a nice routine with my daughter. I took her to the hospital and they found signs of neglect. I explained the situation. The doctor advised me to press charges against my ex husband. I think I will.\n\nBut I\u2019m safe\nMy daughter is safe\n\nTbh i probably won\u2019t come back on Reddit.

        "text": "My fiance and I are getting married in June next year. We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.\n\nWhen we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. \n\nSoon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are \"cultural\" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. \n\nI explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. \n\nWeeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he \"doesn't like\" vegan food.\n\nI refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.\n\nNow my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.\n\nI understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. \n\nAITA? I don't want to seem like a \"pushy vegan\" but I also don't want to pay for meat unless I have to. Again, it's one meal out of their whole life.",

        "text": "I was recently flying from NYC to LAX for a work trip and I had the displeasure of sitting next to a family and a little boy (9). I got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and I needed to eat within two hours so I began snacking. I immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said \u201ccan you not do that? Our son.\u201d so I put my food away and figured I\u2019d wait until the flight attendant came around so I could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  \n\nSo the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, I start to ask for a Coke and a snack box, but before I can finish the sentence the father says \u201cnothing for this row, we\u2019re all set here\u201d and she continues on. I go up to press the call light so I can get my food and my drink because I actually need it and the father says \u201cour son has prader-willi, we\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn\u2019t know he can\u2019t eat and he\u2019s always hungry\u201d. I\u2019m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so I look him in the eye and say \u201cI do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings\u201d. \n\nThe flight attendant comes back and I get my food and my drink, I snarf it down and chug my soda, and I sit back. As soon as I\u2019m calmed and I\u2019m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says \u201cI feel a calling to educate you about my son\u2019s disease\u201d and I felt my entire body clench up. She keeps talking to me and explaining how I\u2019d made her son feel and I said \u201clisten lady, I don\u2019t fucking care, I\u2019m going to handle my T1D the way I see fit and you\u2019re going to handle your son the way you see fit. I\u2019m not endangering myself because you don\u2019t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.\u201d\n\nI recounted the story to a friend of mine once I\u2019d gotten off the plane and she immediately told me that I was a huge AH and I should\u2019ve given them a little bit of grace due to their son\u2019s condition. I kind of feel bad but at the same time, I think that it\u2019s unavoidable if you\u2019re going into public and you\u2019re around others. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "The title probably makes it sound worse than it was, but I\u2019m still conflicted.\n\nMy (f21) boyfriend (m24) of almost a year, invited me to dinner with his family. (Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they\u2019re conservative and christians but lovely people. \n\nAnd they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of \u201clet us dig and let the food keep us quiet.\u201d This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn\u2019t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.\n\nI dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y\u2019know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. \u201cThis is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!\u201d My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, \u201cLet the food keep us quiet.\u201d I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. \n\nAfter a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn\u2019t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn\u2019t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.\n\nMy boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should\u2019ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird. I just couldn't take it anymore. Was I being an asshole though?",

She is 6 months pregnant. \n\nI have been looking for a job with a better pay since my wife said that she wanted to be a SAHM after the birth. \n\nToday, I had this interview for a position at a very good IT company which would be paying triple my current salary. \n\nThere were a lot of measures taken to prevent malpractice. I was not allowed to look anywhere but the screen, etc. The test was conducted on an online platform. \n\nI had told her numerous times before the exam about the strict invigilation. \n\nJust 15 minutes after the test started, my wife started knocking on my study door and calling out my name saying she wanted me to open a jar. I ignored her because I would be disqualified from the interview if I looked anywhere else or spoke...  I figured she'd get the hint that I couldn't talk. But she didn't she yelled at me calling me an AH and went on to talk to her friends on call. It didn't stop at the calls, she played loud music for her online dance yoga class. It was extremely distracting and I made a lot of mistakes in the exam\n\nIt was a multiple choice questions based test so I got the results immediately and as expected I had miserably failed it. \n\nI was livid at my wife. This was the 5th interview that she ruined like this. I told her that I give up on trying to make her life easier and that I'm not ready to go looking for any more jobs since she doesn't even want to maintain silence during important interviews. I told her to start working again after the birth and that I am ok paying for a nanny/babysitter. \n\nShe said that in being unreasonable in expecting perfect silence at home. \n\nAITA?",

There are 5 of us who rent a house together and we all agreed to put a label in our food containers to help keep Jilian safe and avoid contamination. I have a mini fridge in my room where I store my drinks so that I don't have to go to the kitchen if I want a drink in the middle of the night.\n\nWell last Friday my Filipino girlfriend gave me an authentic Filipino dish for lunch at work. It's called kare-kare, it's an ox tail stew with a rich peanut sauce. It's in a glass container, and I saved some so I  can have it for dinner.\n\nWhen I got home I put it in my mini fridge but I forgot to eat it that night because we ordered pizza for dinner. Saturday I went out with my girlfriend and got home at around 9pm. When I arrived Jilian's girlfriend (Trish) confronted me saying I almost killed Jilian. I didn't know what she was talking about, she went on saying how irresponsible of me to not label the food in my mini fridge. I asked one of our housemates wtf happened and he said Jilian had an allergic reaction to my stew because I didn't put a label on the container. I told them it's inside my personal mini fridge and how dare they enter my room. Trish said they were looking for beer when they saw my stew. She and another housemate ate it, Jilian only tasted it and she had an anaphylactic shock where they had to use her EpiPen to stop the swelling.\n\nTrish then demanded that I need to pay for the EpiPen. I told them that is not going to happen. If anything they should apologize to me for trespassing and stealing my food. They called me an asshole. She and 3 housemates said I nearly caused Jilian her life and the least I could do is apologize and pay for the EpiPen. AITA?\n\nEdit for more info: Jilian was taken to the hospital. No, I never gave anyone any permission to enter my room. They were drinking that time and were looking for more beer. They ate the dish with some rice that they found on top of the mini fridge. I think Jilian ate some rice that had sauce on it. I didn't get to ask the details of that exactly happened.\n\nEdit/update: So I visited Jilian in the hospital today and she apologized to me for what happened. It was an accident. She said she didn't eat my kare-kare but took some rice. She didn't realize that some sauce got on the rice bowl, so there was clearly a cross contamination. It wasn't her who went in my room, it was Trish and another housemate, Ian. I will be charging them for the stolen beer and food.\n\nI will definitely buy a lock after this incident. Thank you all for your advice, judgement and awards!",

Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.\n\n\nWhen we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.\n\n\n\nNow he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.\n\n\nETA to clear few points:\n\n\n* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.\n\n\n* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.\n\n\n* I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes.

So I tried calling her but she had blocked my number. I was very Confused and talked to my mother. She was trying to still stay out of it and I got a little mad and said that it was not fair. That my sister was not right because she never formally asked me and how was I supposed to just guess that she wanted it. She tried to justify her but in the end also accepted that my sister was wrong. Non the less she told me to just give her space and that she will just come to terms with it herself.\n\nI waited a few days till I met her in the supermarket. At first she tried to act like she didn't see me but I planted myself infront of her. She was just rolling her eyes saying she had places to be. And I just said \"you know I hope you notice how unfair you are treating me\" and then left her alone.\n\nThat night I received a call where I was berated for being selfish for about 20 minutes by her. I asked her if she was done and asked her if we could talk it out like adults. She came over the next night and we had an exhausting fight. Screaming crying and after all was said and done she actually apologized for everything. She was kind of jealous of my dress and of the wedding I almost had. And she was embarassed that she couldn't afford everything I could and that she felt like she failed as an adult and as a mother. And honestly I get it. Not because I think she is a failure, but because I get how it feels if your brain tells you you failed at life because you don't have things that other people have. She apologized also because she was trying to blame me for her problems and that everything was easier if she wasn't the one to blame. We talked a lot more time till I told her that she didn't need a fancy dress and that we could search something basic and I could help her to decorate it with something. She agreed and we actually did get to customize a very basic gown. As we didn't have much time it's not super fancy. Sadly due to the outbreak the wedding, that was supposed to happen this month, was canceled. They had a courthouse wedding where she wore one of my dresses and she is celebrating in August if it's possible.\n\nThat's everything. So even if I was not an asshole and my sister seemed like a brat... She was dealing with some heavy feelings and I still love her. \n\nThanks for the judgment and advice.",

        "text": "Long story short: I (27f) started seeing 44yo \"Dave\" 3 years ago. I have 2 sons, 9 and 6. He has 1 daughter \"Ann\", 17. I booked a road trip for me and my sons roughly 3 months ago. A road trip consisting of roughly 26 hours worth of driving with stops in between. This is the first time I've ever been financially able to do much of anything with my children so I went all out. Planned to stop at every place they had ever asked me to go, basically. I was beyond excited to surprise them with this trip. We got home 4 nights ago.\n\nA week before leaving my Dave decides he wants to go with me and bring Ann as a \"bonding\" experience. We do not live together and Ann has never liked me because I'm \"boring\". She has said this to my face. So Dave thinks it will be good. I didnt really want either of them to go but thought what the hell, why not. This could be good for us. Boy was I fucking wrong. From the moment Ann got in to my vehicle she started complaining about absolutely everything. It was too crowded, too loud, we were taking too many stops, the boys were \"too annoying\" and \"need to quiet the fuck down and chill out\". \n\nWe get a hotel 9 hours in (PA). Its around 3pm at this point. Dave asks if he can take a drive with Ann because she was getting irritated with the kids. I told him he could if he makes it quick because I needed to go get dinner supplies. 3 hours later he shows back up. Him and Ann went out to eat. So I make a comment saying \"you didnt think we wanted to eat too?\" And Ann snaps back with \"I dont think we asked.\" \n\nAfter comments like this for days I finally snapped. My body are now saying they just want to go home because several times Dave told my kids to be quiet because of his kids comfortability. At this point I havent done anything with my kids because the queen would have a fit if we pulled off anywhere AND Dave at this point basically refused to let me drive despite me arguing. IN MY CAR. So I snapped, told him to pull the fuck over. When he finally does, I drive to the nearest car rental and tell them to get the fuck out of my car. Dave and Ann both start flipping out. Ann saying she isnt going to get in a car that has \"bed bugs\". Dave saying he didnt want to take separate vehicles and didnt have enough money for a rental because the queen spent over $1500 in 4 days. So I say \"I dont believe I fucking asked.\" And take off. They were close to 800 miles from home. It took them 4 days to get home due to lack of money and needing to borrow. I'm being told I'm a selfish cunt. AITA?",

        "text": "My brother\u2019s wife lost her job. Which has caused them to lose the house they were renting. My brother asked if he could stay with me. I talked to my bf and he said sure. \n\nSo, I told my brother yes, *BUT* he can\u2019t bring any of their furniture with them. We don\u2019t have any room for any of it. Our spare room has a bed and dressers in it already. He\u2019ll have to find a place to store their things. He wasn\u2019t happy about it, but said okay and that was that.\n\nWhen they started moving their clothes and whatnot in, they started complaining about how small the room was. I ignored it, because they were used to a rather large house. And I was sympathetic, because I know how it feels to go from having everything to nothing. I apologized and told them that this was the best we had. \n\nIssue:\n\nMy son was in his room, and started crying. I went in there to check on him, and my brother got MAD. I usually keep his door closed when he\u2019s napping(I have a baby monitor) and I guess my brother saw how \u2018large\u2019 his room is. \n\nIt\u2019s not big, at all. By any means. It\u2019s just bigger than the spare room. He asked \u201cwhy the hell\u201d we gave him the small room when we can just move our son into the spare room. \n\nI told him I\u2019m not moving my son and all his things into a different room when the spare bedroom is perfectly fine for the two of them as long as they don\u2019t try to move their entire house into one room. \n\nHe got mad. She got mad. They threw a fit. Then my brother asked why we don\u2019t move my son into our room. I told him that my son\u2019s crib won\u2019t fit in our room. And again, I\u2019m not moving him just to to accommodate them. \n\nThe last week or so has been very...tense. Small comments here. Cold shoulder there. Petty shoulder checks from his wife if we cross close together. I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut, because I love my brother, and I don\u2019t want to cause trouble. Plus, if they weren\u2019t so pissy(I guess is the word) they wouldn\u2019t be hard to live with. \n\nThey\u2019ve started to complain that my son\u2019s crying at night is keeping them awake. Which, I get, but he\u2019s a baby. He only wakes once a night to eat. And that\u2019s not even all the time. \n\nThis morning it all came to a head when my brother told me I should move into the spare room and let them have mine and my boyfriend\u2019s room so that they don\u2019t get woke up by the baby. \n\nWhen I told him no, he started yelling. Calling me selfish and entitled. Told me that I should let them have my room, because my son is \u201can annoying little shit that keeps them up every night, all night.\u201d\n\nWhere I may be the asshole:\n\nI saw red. Let me start this by saying I did NOT yell at my brother as he yelled at me. \n\nI said \u201cIf you can\u2019t appreciate the room you were given, you can go elsewhere. My boyfriend and I have been more than accommodating to you. You constantly complain. You\u2019re ungrateful and rude. Get over yourself or get out of my house.\u201d\n\nETA: I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m TA because my mother called and told me I\u2019m an asshole for not giving the married couple the big bedroom with the connected bathroom. \n\nAnd apparently my other siblings agree?\n\nETA2: They do not pay rent. My boyfriend and I own our home and don\u2019t pay anything on it. They pay the difference on the electricity bill and buy some of their own groceries. \n\nI do the majority of the cooking and all the cleaning.\n\nETA3: Boyfriend and I are going to talk about kicking them out tonight when he gets off work.\n\nETA4: I will update y\u2019all tomorrow \ud83d\ude02",

        "text": "I (15F) am deaf in both ears after getting meningitis as a toddler. Luckily my parents really pushed intervention, so I can read lips, know sign language and have cochlear implants, so I\u2019m basically like any other girl my age. I just can\u2019t hear for shit.\n\nMy aunt (40) has been staying with my family-that\u2019s me, my mom, my dad and my 13 year old sister- during quarantine. She is REALLY not someone I like. She critiques every little thing my sister and I do, tells us we need to eat more (or less, depending on the day, even though we\u2019re skinny), butts in to our personal conversation and just is snoopy in general. She tries to instigate fights between us- like asking my sister if she\u2019s mad I have something she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s also important to know she\u2019s done nothing to learn about communicating with me. I\u2019d say about 90% of the rest of my extended family knows sign language. We\u2019ve told our parents about it a million times, and they\u2019ve talked to her. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve given her an ultimatum, so my sister and I devised a plan. \n\nFor the past few days whenever my aunt starts talking, I just detach my hearing aids and my sister puts in her airpods and turns up the volume. We can understand each other fine. My aunt didn\u2019t get it the first couple of times but I think today she understood we were ignoring her and got really upset. She told my dad, and from what I understand, he basically told her she needs to lay off if she\u2019s bothering us that bad or she can leave. I was happy to hear that, tbhz \n\nI heard (lol) her crying later though, and that made me feel like *shit*. I never meant to make someone cry and now I kinda regret the whole thing. Are my sister and I assholes for going to such extreme measures? We just wanted her to leave us alone, or at least be nice to us.\n\nEDIT: Wow I went to sleep and look what I woke up too! Thanks for all the nice comments and stuff! Here\u2019s a few things I wanted to point out.\n\nI have good hearing with the implants in. Without them in,  I will only hear some thing VERY loud right next to my ear (like if someone claps into it). Doctors typically rate it on a scale- I am severely deaf. Cochlear implants have two parts- external and internal. The external connects to the internal with a magnet. It comes off like you would take off a magnet on your fridge. I CAN switch it off, but I thought the message would get across better if I yanked it off my head. \n\nI wish I could answer everyone who\u2019s PM\u2019d me or left comments about the implants. I think unfortunately that\u2019s something for your doctor- everyone is different. \n\nI agree aunt doesn\u2019t need to learn sign language. However- because I was in early intervention and then speech therapy for most of my childhood, I have a more \u201cnormal\u201d speaking voice and so she says I should talk. It\u2019s a bit nasally sounding to me and I prefer to sign. Aunt likes to move out of my line of sight and that forces me to speak and makes me feel bad. \n\nAlso, yes my little sister is amazing. Thanks for all the nice comments about her. She\u2019s my best friend and I love her so much. \n\nWe decided to be nice to aunt today and see what happens. \n\nTalk atcha later!",

He fixed the air conditioner no problem, but once he\u2019d left I woke up to a million missed texts and calls from my wife, who was hysterical. \n\nApparently within minutes of showing up he made comments about her body and other suggestive statements. She made it clear she wasn\u2019t interested without being outright rude because she didn\u2019t want him to get mad and leave without fixing the air conditioner. \n\nThe tech kept trying to put moves on her, then after he\u2019d fixed the A/C, he didn\u2019t leave right away, trying to feed her some lines about how she seemed to be home alone and he could \u201cspend the night to make sure she was safe.\u201d \n\nEventually he realized he was driving down a dead end and left, but the whole thing just really freaked her out, having some guy in the house who didn\u2019t leave when asked and everything. \n\nI was pissed to hear about all this, and she was shaken up by the incident, so we left a review on their Google and Yelp pages saying what had happened. \n\nThe company is pretty small so the owner called me to apologize a couple days later and said the tech had had a few drinks that night, not expecting to be called out to an emergency job, and that \u201chis sense of humor had clearly been misinterpreted\u201d by my wife. \n\nHe asked me to take my review down because it called the tech out by first name and apparently a review saying he was coming onto a female customer could cause some personal problems for the guy. \n\nThe owner also reasoned that the business was an air conditioner repair business, not a bedside manner business, and that they did fix the air conditioner, so deserved a higher rating. \n\nI told them our review stands, and they basically said we were assholes for threatening the reputation of their business and the personal reputation of the tech over a single misunderstanding. \n\nOn the one hand, they did fix the air conditioner, and that\u2019s what we called them to do.

I said \"I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!\" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said \"well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway\" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.\n\n\nI went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute \"you're making money a priority just like my ex did\" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.\n\nWe've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",

The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.\n\nI later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. \n\nWIBTA if I refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? I know wedding meals are expensive, but I think this was their mistake.",

        "text": "My (f42) husband (m44) and I have been married for 21 years. We have two adult children (m22 and m24), one is in college out of state and the other is in the navy.\n\nWhen we first got married, my husband was in navy, and we spent the first 10 years of our marriage moving from place to place, wherever his new duty station was. I found it hard to make friends, and I could not keep a job, so I made a difficult decision and decided to be a SAHM. \n\nWhen he got out of the navy eleven years ago, he took a job and we moved. Three years in, he got offered a job in another part of the company, however, it was in another state, so we moved again. We stayed there for six years. I went back to college and got my degree and began looking for work. I found a job I liked in my field, and six months into working, he said he was offered a job with a new company and wanted to take it, but that would mean we would be moving almost 2,000 miles from where we were in a new state. I reluctantly agreed because the new state would have more job opportunities for me and we would be closer to our family, which is something that we have not had in many years. \n\nLast night my husband came up to me and said that there was a job opening in his company and he wanted to apply for it. It would mean a pay raise and better hours, but the caveat would be that we have to move again. We have been living in our new state for three years. I love it here. I have an amazing job and I am making great money. I finally have friends and am able to socialize. I told him that I am not moving again. Any time we have to move, he always leaves first and I end up being responsible for selling/packing the house, and I am not doing that again. Our sons college is only 2 hours from here, we can see him twice a month. If we move, that means we would have at least a days drive and would only be able to do that once or twice a year!\n\nNow my husband is upset with me and guilt tripping me because he claims I do not  support him. I told him that was BS because I spent most of my life moving from place to place to support his career. He told me that I am selfish and he is just trying to provide for us. I told him that we are more than comfortable where we are now, and that if he truly wants to take the job, he will be going alone.\n\nAITA for refusing to move again?\n\n*post update*\nI hope that this is allowed. \n\nI apologize for not being able to respond to everyone. And thank you all for your kindness and replies. \n\nTo answer some questions.\n1. My husband and I have been together since I was 15 and he was 17. He joined the navy right after graduation from high school when he was 18 and I was 16, but had to wait two years before we could marry. \n\n2. He works for a company that has plants in 15 states. He is currently in middle management, but if he wants to advance his career further, he would need to go to another plant out of state. \n\n3. Financially we are more than comfortable. We do not need anymore money. \n\n4. My son plans to stay in the place he is after college. We have a great relationship with him and he comes home one time a month and we see him one time a month. My other son comes home on leave whenever he can and stays with us. We are very close to both of the boys. \n\n5. I talked to my husband again tonight and told him quite firmly that moving again was not an option for me. The area he wants to moves has very little jobs in my field and specialty in that area and I would need to commute more than an hour one way for a job versus the 20 minutes I have here. We are sandwiched between two major cities, and if we move we would be an hour from the most major city. I would also have to take a massive pay cut and work a menial job to build a new network to find employment in my field. \n\n6. My husband is disappointed in me for not wanting to leave. He left to stay with a friend because he \u201cneeds to think.\u201d He doesn\u2019t understand why I would force him to turn down an opportunity to advance his career further. I told him to take all the time he needs, but I am not moving again. I said I would revisit the possibility when I am ready for retirement in 15 years but no sooner.",

        "text": "Hear me out please. I'm a 46 year-old father who lost a daughter (Molly) years ago to Brain Cancer. Molly's death broke me. She was my only child I'm no longer who I was before this tragedy. I married my wife when my stepdaughter (Sarah) was 15. Sarah had issues with her mom. Her mom would kick her out over small arguments. She kicked her out for getting a haircut, for failing one class and other reasons. Every time she'd bring her back home and tell her to learn her lesson or she'd be kicked out. One time her mom kicked her out over a dairy at 17 and Sarah had enough and didn't return. She started working. I remained in contact. I just couldn't let her struggle I tried to help her financially but she refused. she's incredibly independent and a hard working person. She reminded me of Molly. \n\nI decided to help in other ways. I got her a better job opportunity by calling someone I knew at the time. This way she still had to work to earn money which is something she wanted. And also work a better job that appreciated her more than the previous job. She's an artist, she wanted to be a graphic designer\nI sold my old car to pay for her courses. She started paying me back bit by bit only because she's independent. She lived with her then boyfriend now husband and paid for other things.\n\nMy wife didn't try to mend things. She disowned Sarah the day she got married but I stood firm and told her that I'm free to talk to Sarah and she should respect that.\nI attend gatherings with Sarah from time to time and she calls me dad infront of other people. In the past it was just my name.\nThis sounds crazy but I believe this all happened just so I could meet Sarah and have a chance at being the best father that I could be.\n\nShe's now 22 and just had a babygirl a few weeks ago. I visited several times and we talked. She told me that it was unfortunate that she lost her dad but was glad she has me in her life. I cried although I'm not good at expressing emotions and it got worse after Molly's death.\n\nMy wife knew about the baby and demanded I give her the address so she could go see her granddaughter. I refused because Sarah asked me not to tell. And because she's already dealing with postpartum and will not be able to deal with her mom's behavior. My wife threw a fit and said that this is her daughter and grandbaby and I shouldn't try to stop her from seeing her. She called me selfish and cruel. The argument didn't stop. The family are agreeing with her and telling me to stay out of it. I argued with my wife about it again. And she said I had no right and that I needed to give her the address. She didn't even seem regretful or wanted to apologize. Everyone is blaming me telling I'm being cruel and demanding I give her the address.",

        "text": "I am 32F. I grew up with a narcissistic mom. I have never met my dad. The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed. I know I misled them, but I honestly wanted my sister to be safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for causing my step sister's depression and robbing her of college\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your reassurance. I showed this post to my sister and the only thing she had to say was \"Duh\". We both have discussed and decided to not contact our step sister. We were never close to her and my friends back there can't safely get any message to her without dragging our mom into it which is the last thing we both want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll these awards, thank you all again and the kind stranger who gave me gold.",

But when he is working he is WORKING at keeping me alive. He's saved my life multiple times\n\nNow my friend has been coming over a lot recently to visit. I love her but have an issue with her husband. He's one of those types who harbors the believe that have a dick makes him superior to women. He also doesn't believe in invisible disabilities and because of Onyx he's never seen me have a seizure.\n\nLast week they came over and her husband was being playful with Onyx which was fine as he was at rest. A little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring Onyx to their place for a sleepover. I said no and explained AGAIN that Onyx is a service dog and I needed him to ya know...... Stay alive. Her husband got an attitude and told me Onyx wasn't a machine and I had no right to deprive him of fun. Then he pulled the I'm a man so I know more than you card by explaining that I was wrong and he was right and I could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. All this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. \n\nI asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude I am and what happened to manners and Onyx would've had fun they both did.\n\nNow today my friend called asking if they could stop by. I explained that I would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. She got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. I got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if I should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. She just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted Onyx to have fun. I just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.\n\nAITA. I feel awful and feel like I'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and I worry that his disbelief of my need for a service animal will cause him to do something completely crazy.\n\n\nEdit. I had to work with Onyx for two weeks at a training center before I could even bring him home so he knew exactly how to help me i.e read my body and triggers and so we worked together and we're completely in synch. He's extremely well trained and I feel like that might have something to do with this.",

TLDR at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that \"Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.\n\nAITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?\n\nTLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\n\nAs many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission.",

I\u2019m known to be a huge pushover, and my friend knows this to be true and she can be pretty manipulative and caused me to second guess myself. She also still isn\u2019t talking to me, which is fine by me. As for the package, our mutual friend found the box it was supposed to be shipped in by the trash in front of her house so I guess she\u2019s not shipping it anymore. I don\u2019t know what was in it, but all evidence and other context which is too long to post points to it being a \u201csubstance\u201d. At This point, I\u2019m hoping that it was just weed and not something more dangerous. Once again, thank you everyone! \n\nI will soon be flying to the other side of the world, and my friend asked me to take a package with me and deliver it to her friend who lives in the country I am flying to. \n\nNow, I trust my friend with my life, but I told her that since it\u2019s an international flight and taking unneeded risks are unwise, I would appreciate it if I can open the package, with her present, and look through it just to make sure there\u2019s nothing \u201cundesirable\u201d in it. \n\nMy friend immediately gets offended, and she even starts yelling at me, telling me how she can\u2019t believe that I don\u2019t trust her, and that I am invading her privacy. She told me I\u2019m being selfish and paranoid, and that she won\u2019t let me see inside the package because it has \u201csensitive content\u201d. That ended up freaking me out more so I told her that I can\u2019t do it if I can\u2019t make sure it\u2019s safe, and that I\u2019m sorry. \n\nShe started to cry and left the room. She later left me a text saying I\u2019m selfish and that she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore. While I feel bad, I have heard all kinds of stories and I don\u2019t want to put into a position where I am responsible for whatever \u201csensitive content\u201d in her package. \n\nReddit, AITA?\n\nEdit1: a comment here made me want to add more context. I trust my friend a lot, but I should mention that my friend is known to cultivate weed and then store them in spice jars. I could have sworn I heard noises of glass in the package and she has joked before that she could smuggle weed disguised as a spice or herb or something and that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t know a thing\u201d. I do trust her, but I just want peace of mind you know. I\u2019m sad she\u2019s offended but I just wish she could understand my POV\n\nEdit2: Wow! I woke up to so much engagement in this post! Thank you all for your replies and assuring me I\u2019m NTA! And thanks for the awards! As for updates, my friend hasn\u2019t spoken to me since the incident and has had a message delivered to me via mutual friend saying the only way she\u2019ll talk to me is if I take this package from her, and \u201ctrust in our friendship\u201d. However, I heard from my other friend that the person I was supposed to deliver the package to has a reputation involving drugs, and while we didn\u2019t get into details my friend just said \u201cand not for using them\u201d. I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone of anything, rumors fly and innocent until proven guilty, but I am definitely not taking that package anymore, unless I can get a pretty good look at it.\n\nEdit3: I just saw a comment asking me if I know a Jason who stores Olives in his fridge, I replied this to them: \u201cSorry for replying late! Funny enough, her boyfriends name is Jason! Fun fact to enhance this story, he loves a show called breaking bad so bad that he legally gave himself the middle name Walter! But sadly I do not know if they keep their olives refrigerated.\u201d \n\nI just read the story in question about Jason and his refrigerated olives, there may be a connection! But then again, most likely not. I\u2019ll try my best to do some digging (but if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m kind of freaked out enough by the situation to avoid \u201cinvestigating\u201d anything for my own safety) and I\u2019ll update this story as long as you guys are interested! Once again thank you all!",

        "text": "So for background, my best friend has gotten into going to these Spartan races. He and a small group of his friends have started going to local ones but recently heard about one in another state they wanted to go to and compete in, but they didn't have anywhere to stay. So they asked me if they could borrow my truck and trailer (I have a tow behind camper) for the weekend. I said no, I wasn't comfortable with them taking my truck and trailer but that I'd drive them and the camper to their event. We made the three hour trip and set everything up in the area where the race was taking place the next day. \n\nI have a habit of leaving my keys on a hook next to the door to my bedroom in my camper. Remember this. \nCome nightfall, I went to take a phone call outside and ended up wandering around the grounds for over an hour. When I got back to the camper, the door was locked, and I was told by my best friend's older friend through the window that there wasn't enough room for me in MY trailer. So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room. So I called my best friend from outside and all I was told was \"sorry bro, nothing I can do\". So I ended up sleeping in my truck that night, which I had fortunately left unlocked by accident.\n\nTheir race began at 8 am, and at 7, they came meandering out of the trailer and woke me up. No apology, by the way. \n\nSo while they were in their race, I hooked my truck back up to the trailer, closed and locked everything, and waited until just after they finished and had started walking back to the trailer (think really wide open field). When I saw them coming, I started the truck and drove off the property. With them chasing behind. I made the three hour trip back home declining call after call. When I finally got home, I finally took my best friend's call. He started yelling at me saying \"why would you do this? We have no way home now\". I just said sorry, you shouldn't have made me sleep in my truck after I did you this solid. \n\nHe told me that there were better ways to handle this than by leaving them in an unfamiliar city with no way home. I think he ended up calling his dad to come and get them. \n\nIs he right? Was there a better way to handle this? I felt justified until he said that. I am kinda doubting my decision now. \nAm I the asshole?",

        "text": "My boyfriend grew up in a house that valued outdated gender norms. The women were always responsible for cooking and cleaning, so he didn't learn how to do any of that for most of his life. That is, until he moved in with me after college. \n\nHe's been good about a few things. He doesn't mind helping with dishes or handling the laundry, but the one thing I can't seem to get him to do is learn how to cook. The only thing he can do is microwave frozen meals. I've been trying to teach him the basics, but it seems like it goes through one ear and just comes out the other. He still can't turn on the oven or use the stove without help. The toaster is too complicated for him to use he claims.  Doesn't know how to boil eggs, cook rice, or even how to measure out ingredients using cups. I just don't understand why he can't grasp this but is fine with other things. \n\nHere's the part where I may be an asshole. I went on a trip two weeks ago for work. I'm in charge of buying groceries (we have separate accounts) and I realized how expensive his frozen meals actually are. Three to four dollars for each. I said screw it and bought the easiest ingredients I could find for a lot cheaper for him to cook on his own. He doesn't like leftovers, so me cooking ahead for him was out. Before I left, I sat him down once again and gave him a very long lesson on using the oven, toaster, and stove, as well as how to boil/scramble eggs, toast a piece of toast, boil rice/noodles, and heat up pasta sauce. I also taught him how to pan fry things like onions and other veggies, and how to tell when they were ready. In case he didn't want to cook both lunch and dinner, I also bought things to make salads and fixings for sandwiches. \n\nI come back a week later, and he is angry! He claims I practically left him to starve, and how I know he has trouble cooking. I retaliate, saying I showed him what to do, and I get a whole range of excuses. \"Setting the oven/stove temp is too complicated\" \"He cut his finger chopping onions and couldn't chop any until his cut healed\" \"He only likes the salad kits so everything is balanced\" \n\nApparently he only ate sandwiches, canned goods, and fast food for a week. He thinks I'm a major asshole for not telling him I'm not buying his frozen meals, and leaving him alone to fend for himself. On one hand, I do think it was shitty of me not to tell him I didn't buy his meals, and as someone who grew up in a home pretty much only boiled hotdogs and veggies, and only properly learned how to cook after moving, out I do feel for him, but at the same time, after a few months of not getting the simplest concepts, I'm left feeling partially justified in my actions. So Reddit, AITA?",

To the point that about 4 years ago after our son was born when my wife decided not to go back to work I became the only source of income. \n\nThis worked out well and everyone was happy until COVID hit. Once the pandemic started causing shut downs my role was transitioned from in an office downtown to working from home. I was a big fan of this. I work 5am to 7pm Mon to Sat typically so not having to commute meant that now I got to be home to put my son to bed and read to him at night and have more time to spend with my wife in the evenings. The only problem is that my wife has struggled with the idea that the location of my job has changed but my responsibilities have not. I've had several discussions with her about the fact that even though I'm home now I'm not able to watch our son during the day, or explaining why I can't get to the dishes till that evening. She will nod along to but I don't think she really believes it. This has caused tension but not an outright fight until this week.\n\nSome of our mutual friends are coming into town this weekend and we had made plans to spend time with them. However, on Monday my wife informs me that the couple is actually getting in Friday and she and her friend are going to get lunch and go shopping. She tells me that I will need to watch our son. I respond by saying again that I can't, I have work and Monday to Friday is not enough heads up for me to take a day off. She gets angry at me saying she watches our son everyday while I just \"sit in my office from sun up to sun down\" and how I should be able to watch our son so she can have a day off. She's given me the cold shoulder since then.\n\nI would love to spend the day with my son I just can't take the time off on such short notice. AITA?",

        "text": "My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the \"what if\" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.\n\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.\n\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\n\nAITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?\n\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\u2019m going to get snipped ASAP.\n\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",

I started seeing a therapist because of the nightmares and the fact that I was panicking any time I got into a car.\n\nThat lead to me realizing there were some deeper issues, which we worked on. As part of that work, I got a physical, started working with a dietician to fix my diet and the smorgasbord of vitamin deficiencies it caused. I started working out (strength training 3 days and sprints or HIIT on 3) with our older sis. \n\nBy the end of our first year of college, we had each gained about 30 lbs. By the end of the next year, I had lost half of it, but I was smaller at 134 lbs. than my previous 120 because of the muscle mass. And that's been my size for the past half decade.\n\nI found a new beautician, and she gave me long layers (to make my natural curls be curls instead of waves of frizz) I always wanted but that my old one said would look bad and refused. I stopped bleaching it and let it go its natural dark blonde/light brown. I stopped spray tanning. Again, that's been my look for the past five years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in a rural area, and the internet isn't great. Things like facetime just aren't options, and I can't post a lot of pics on social media b/c of it. This is relevant because a big issue is that May didn't see me over the quarantine. \n\nWe talked on the phone a couple times a week, but it mostly revolved around her wedding planning (she got engaged before the Rona put us on lockdown). I wasn't her MoH, so mostly I was being told decisions, not involved in the process. When it came to the bridesmaids' dresses, May sent our sister, SIL, and me a link and told us to get it in our size. \n\nSame with hair and makeup, but we had to arrange for a beautician because May's wouldn't do more than four, and she wanted her friends at the appointment with her.\n\nExcept she didn't do a bachelorette party with us (she did with her friends) or rehearsal dinner, so May didn't see any of us until the start of the wedding. \n\nShe was livid. Apparently, she thought we would have stopped working out because of the Rona (even though we did it at home?) or that we would have stopped when she announced her engagement, so we didn't upstage her. She was mad because I didn't try to hide my scar and didn't tan, thought it   \n\"would be implied.\"\n\nShe made several snide remarks before throwing a drunk temper tantrum at the reception, basically accusing the 3 of us, but me esp. of trying to upstage her. I don't have that excuse b/c I was a DD so sober, but I (quite famously) have a low tolerance for angry or crying drunks. I told her \"If you're so insecure, you should've got off your ass instead of expecting us to lay on ours to make yours look better.\" It only got worse. \n\nOur family is on my side b/c I didn't start it or **do** anything, but his family and her friends are giving me shit.

        "text": "6 years ago I met the best person in the world. She was a sweet old lady that moved in next door, named Maggie. Maggie taught me how to knit, we watch Mamas family together, i helped her give her cat her medicine, I helped water her plants when she got to frail to do it herself. She knitted me a hat for every holiday., I helped her install WiFi. Maggie was a nurse in WWII.\n\nMaggie passed away 3 months ago at the age of 94. She went peacefully in her sleep, and it is the heartbreak of my life. About two weeks after she died, I noticed a man walking into Maggie\u2019s house. Maggie didn\u2019t have any family except for a nephew, who lived across the country. I went up to him and asked who he was, and he said he was going to clean out his aunts things.\n\nThat was the end of that until yesterday. Maggie\u2019s nephew had rung my doorbell, and had told me that Maggie left me most everything she had in her will. Maggie left me 1 million dollars in a account I can open when I turn 18, most of her personal effects, and her cat, blue. Who I rescued two days after she died and kept. She wrote me and her nephew letters. she said some stuff I would rather not share. It tore me up about Maggie even more. She was such a gentle soul and she deserved better. \n\nI started crying, and I told my parents. They started celebrating about  it immediately. I asked them to stop. And they did, until today they presented me with a cake, that said \u201chey, you get to go to college!\u201d. To say that it made me upset is a understatement. I get that Maggie\u2019s money is a life changing thing, but I would much rather have Maggie. \n\nI told them to stop celebrating then I went to my room to hold blue and cry. My brother knocked on my door and told me I was being a asshole because our parents are just happy for me. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called \u201cJan\u201d. I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I\u2019m a tall and lanky male at 6\u20191 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.\n\n\nRecently, we had a watch party at Jan\u2019s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said \u201cI sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.\u201d \n\nJan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn\u2019t appreciate that I called him skinny. \n\nThis caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying \u201cwhat makes you think that you can call him skinny when you\u2019re literally built of twigs?\u201d \u201cYou would die playing football. Tbh I don\u2019t think you could even lift a helmet!\u201d \n\nAt first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.\n\n\u201cLook at you, you\u2019re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials\u201d  (I\u2019m brown but not African)\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished\u201d\n\nShe kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn\u2019t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.\n\nHer: \u201cGo lift some weights. It\u2019s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIf you could tell me what your current diet is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll put on weight in no time.\u201d\n\n*silence*\n\nHer: \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m saying that if I\u2019m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I\u2019m pretty certain you wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cNo wonder [ex] didn\u2019t want you. Go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cAnd no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.\u201d\n\nAt this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.\n\nSince this was at Jan\u2019s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan\u2019s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn\u2019t feel that way and I don\u2019t want to apologize.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nEDIT: grammar\n\nINFO: we were both drunk but I\u2019m pretty certain she had drank more than me \n\nEDIT: woah! thanks for platinum and silver you beautiful bastards! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nINFO: I was drunk so the real argument obviously had a few stumbles and slurred words.

        "text": "I\u2019m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn\u2019t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. \n\n\nBy the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn\u2019t pay for college, I\u2019d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I\u2019ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. \n\n\nThe issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They\u2019d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn\u2019t get out of. \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn\u2019t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said \u201cYour dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they\u2019ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \n\n\nI was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \n\n\nThe exact statement my mom had made was \u201cYou made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...\u201d and so on.\n\n\nI said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it\u2019s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn\u2019t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn\u2019t for them, I wouldn\u2019t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. \n\n\nSince that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is \u201crightfully theirs.\u201d My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it\u2019s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn\u2019t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.\n\n\nI\u2019m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn\u2019t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?",

        "text": "My wife and I recently found out we\u2019re having a daughter. We hadn\u2019t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom\u2019s name was Karen and my mom\u2019s name wasn\u2019t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom\u2019s name as her first name and her mom\u2019s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can\u2019t okay \u201cKaren\u201d as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don\u2019t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I\u2019d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn\u2019t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she\u2019s pretty insistent on Karen.\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up. I thought I\u2019d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I\u2019d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she\u2019s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn\u2019t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I\u2019d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won\u2019t be a meme by the time she\u2019s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I\u2019ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still). It seemed completely perfect to both of us so we\u2019re going with it. Thanks for all your inputs!",

        "text": "A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, \"one way or another\", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here? Should I have kept quiet?",

        "text": "My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).\n\nEver since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.\n\nI am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the \"drag queens son\".\n\nI tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.\n\nEver since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. AITA for speaking to my ex this way?",

I\u2019m the black sheep in that I\u2019m the only one not married with kids, but that\u2019s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don\u2019t want kids, and having a partner just isn\u2019t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I\u2019m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been \u201cew, never\u201d.\n\nI was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I\u2019m not anxious to have kids since I\u2019m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn\u2019t appreciate. I said let\u2019s move on, but my mom said \u201cWe\u2019re just worried about you.\u201d\n\nThis is where I\u2019m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the only person at this table that\u2019s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I\u2019m not the one to worry about.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.\n\nI feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.",

Morgan from what I understand is what everyone call \"the handsome\" guy in the office. He dated 2 of his coworkers and hit on several others. He seemed friendly when we talked, he seemed respectable and never asked questions outside of work.\n\n\nHe offered to buy me lunch and internet and kept sending me funny memes and stuff. It was nice but felt a bit too much so I asked that he stop and he did.\n\n\nHe started sending me pics of him that were inappropriate. I texted him saying that I'm married and he was being inappropriate. He texted saying I was lying about being married to get him off my back, then went on about how nice and attractive he is, and how I'm trying to act like I don't like him to get him to try harder. I felt frustrated especislly after he kept sendig me pics. Days ago he sent me a d&ck pic and told me to \"suck it\". I decided to let my husband deal with it. He sent him a text back saying \"sorry bud, small objects are a chocking hazard for her\". Then blocked him.\n\nThe other day he came into the office looking furious and \"confronted\" me about being misleading by not having a wedding ring on when I'm married. I said I didn't need to prove anything to anybody and didn't lead anyone on. He said he was trying to get close to me and I should've told him I'm married from the get go. I said I was sorry but he maybe he shouldn't have basically tried to enforce a relationship with anyone regradless if they're in a relationship or not. He said that my husband and I were rude and offensive then rushed out. Other coworkers said Morgan was an asshole but I too bare the blame for having my wedding ring on and being somewhat misleading. I said I don't think I owe anyone an explanation and refused to apologize for what happened just to keep the peace in the office.\n\n\nAITA really for not wearing my wedding ring?\n\nEdit the reason I don't wear my wedding ring is because of skin problems.",

My brother was Emma\u2019s court appointed guardian from when she was 15 months old to just before her 3rd birthday. \n\nI had to fight for almost a year to get her back. My brother and SIL are still upset that I \u201ctook Emma from them\u201d and have called CPS on me numerous times and make it clear that they don\u2019t trust me to take care of my own kid. \n\nThey love Emma and Emma loves them so I try to take her to see them a couple times a month. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Emma caught the stomach flu from someone at her preschool. I\u2019m in school full time and had a midterm that day so I asked my brother to watch her for a couple hours so I could take my test. They said they were happy to take her so I brought her to their house that morning with her medicines, a schedule saying when she\u2019s supposed to take which medicine and the dosage, a bottle of pedialyte, and a few changes of clothes. \n\nI came to pick her up after the midterm and half her medicines, her clothes, and her pedialyte were gone. When I asked about it they said they threw away all of her medicines and the pedialyte because they were liquids and they were already opened so I could\u2019ve put something in there to make her sick/sleep (not that it helps much but I never hurt my daughter or gave her anything that wasn\u2019t recommended by her pediatrician). They also said I shouldn\u2019t be giving her Tylenol and Motrin (again, her doctor said it\u2019s fine) so they didn\u2019t buy her any Motrin. \n\nThen I asked about the nausea medicine (prescription) and they said they didn\u2019t think she needs prescription meds for the stomach flu. \n\nThey also felt her clothes weren\u2019t good enough for her so they gave it to their neighbor for their garage sale and bought her new clothes, meaning they most likely took her shopping when she was sick and should\u2019ve been resting.\n\nI left with Emma and haven\u2019t spoken to them since except to tell them they will not be allowed anywhere near my kid unsupervised. \n\nI\u2019m working on thanksgiving so I was going to drop Emma off with my parents so she could see my family but I still don\u2019t want her to be around them without me so I\u2019m leaving her with her babysitter instead.\n\nNow my family is giving me a hard time for not letting my brother and SIL see Emma and are excusing what they did by saying they were just worried about her.\n\nAITA for not letting my daughter see my brother and SIL\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not going to do the post cards.

Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He\u2019s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He\u2019s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it\u2019s helped somewhat.\n\nTheir dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son\u2019s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. \n\nMy daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. \n\nHer college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn\u2019t leave, and he wasn\u2019t calm for hours. I\u2019d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make it. \n\nShe called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I\u2019d missed every game and performance she\u2019d had as a child and it clearly wasn\u2019t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can\u2019t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I\u2019ve barely spoken with her since. She didn\u2019t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn\u2019t shown up for holidays and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s engaged but didn\u2019t call to tell me. She\u2019s cut us out, and in the one of three times we\u2019ve spoken since she said it\u2019s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn\u2019t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. \n\nAITA - I\u2019ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn\u2019t a perfect mom growing up - I didn\u2019t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring.

He was a gamer and had all types of gaming gear including a gaming chair that he wanted me to have before he died. It's devastating because we were really hoping and had plans to spend Christmas 2021 together. This chair I consider special because it was my brother's favorite of all gear and it remindes me of him whenever I sit in it (I don't play anymore) It just brings me closer to him to a degree I can not explain and it brings me so much comfort.\n\n\nI keep the chair in my office and days ago I found out that my fiancee who has been out of job and complaining about no longer being able to attend the gym took the chair and sold it online to be able to pay for her next month's gym membership. When I found out I flipped out hugely and had a very negative reaction. She told me that she was desperate for money and after selling all she had she had no choice but to sell the chair. I reminded her of who this chair belongs to but she said I already have tons of keepsakes from my brother and so I shouldn't act like it was the end of the world. She also vented about her past eating disorders and her anxiety when it comes to keeping fit and claimed I was dismissing that she is struggling. I yelled at her and called her inconsiderate and selfish and told her she should have never ever took and sold any of my stuff for a gym membership when she literally could-ve kept working out from home. She started crying as we argued then she went to stay with her mom who tried to give me a stern talk about my attitude and but I didn't answer that and haven't been talking to my fiancee since then. Things haven't got better and I got called overdramatic for reacting and treating my fiancee like that over a gaming chair. I feel guilty because I've never yelled at her in my life before.\n\nAITA? Was I too hard on her?\n\nSome said I went overboard because this is a gaming chair and it was bit childish of me to make a fuss over it but I already explained why I had this reaction aside from the fact that money is an issue we already have.\n\nEDIT because I feel like I should add more of her side to the conflict: she told me if say I was struggling and needed money and sold some item she had then she wouldn't be mad at me but I'm not sure since I'd never do such thing but still she insisted that nomatter what I do she'll always be supportive and understanding just like I should be supportive and understanding of her struggle right now. That made me feel horrible because she had a breakdown and cried because of me.\n\nEDIT Some asked about her age. She's 31 years old and we've been together for 7 years. I'm sorry for not including that earlier on. I'll answer any further questions when I have the time.",

She\u2019s a nice person but she can be pretty mean and childish if we do something she doesn\u2019t like. She also has a tendency to run to our dad if she hears something bad about us. \n\nLong story short, I have a diary and I keep a lot of private stuff in it. Dad called me a few days ago (we were visiting with our mom) saying he has to talk to me when I come back. Apparently I was in trouble because of something I apparently said to stepmom. \n\nWhen he told me what she said I said, I immediately recognized it because I wrote it in my diary. I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was write. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap.\n\nDad calls me while out visiting with friends, and when I come back he grounds me for what I \u201cdid\u201d. Stepmom comes in later, apologized and said it sounded \u201cconcerning\u201d and she had to tell. \n\nI told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and tried to talk to me and I told him that stepmom was reading my diary and he didn\u2019t believe me. \n\nNow I\u2019m with my mom, and I don\u2019t know if what I did was fair. I felt it was the only way to prove my point and I didn\u2019t know what else to do. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: wow thank you so much for the award! I honestly didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, but I just want to thank all of you for your support and ideas. A lot of people have been saying to either get a licking diary or an online diary, so I'm looking into that. in the mean time I am currently staying with my mom and I am trying to as long as possible.

Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. \n\nI tried being polite about it \"Sweetie where's your mommy?\" -points to mom- \"Ma'am!\" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says \"I don't wanna\" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. \n\n\nFinally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record \"why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that\" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. \n\nI'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. \"LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!\" \n\nPeople looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

        "text": "I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). \n\nThe last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn\u2019t want her boys to see it. \n\nNow it\u2019s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. \n\nAnyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. \n\nNow I\u2019m back she\u2019s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I\u2019m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. \n\nI personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it\u2019s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I\u2019m living in.\n\nEdit: for more info, this isn\u2019t a random house I\u2019ve moved back into. I\u2019ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. \n\nSo this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",

I wasn't happy (she's quite snobbish, almost in a comically villainous way. She once made fun of the fact that I get most of my groceries from the local big box super center and not somewhere with more \"high quality product\").\n\n  \nBut I love John and it mattered a lot to him, so I agreed.\n\n  \nOnto the issue: on the final night of my bachelorette party, we decided to have one \"big\" meal that was really pricey and fancy that we all saved up for. Sarah said she had to take an emergency work meeting and for us to go ahead first (the restaurant was walkable from our hotel).\n\n  \nGuys, when Sarah showed up, I was FLOORED. She came in a white sparkly sequin number with a tulle skirt and a tiara. When we were planning the trip, my MOH made it abundantly clear that everyone was supposed to wear pink so we could get a really cute photo together at the restaurant.  \nI'm not even kidding, her outfit was so bridal looking the waitress actually asked if we were having a joint bachelorette party. I was so upset, that when it came time to take photos I absolutely refused to have Sarah in them.\n\n  \nShe said it wasn't her fault because she \"didn't get the memo\", but I told her it was common sense to not wear a bridal looking dress to a bachelorette party if you're not the bride!Plus, she was in the group chat and even made comments about another girl's outfit when we were talking about what we wanted to wear, so I know she knew!\n\n  \nAll of my friends were on my side and they made sure she didn't end up in the photos. When we got home, she pitched a fit to my brother saying that we bullied her at my party and deliberately left her out. She was also pissed because a lot of family and friends noticed she wasn't in the photos and I wasn't afraid to tell them exactly why.\n\n  \nMy brother's really upset though because she's been crying and whining about it nonstop since. Apparently they're both so mad that they're going to skip father's day brunch, so the whole thing is blowing up even more.\n\n  \nI'm starting to feel bad because my mom told me that my brother and Sarah were fighting a lot now, so I'm not sure if I'm being the AH here. My brother called me a bridezilla, but I really feel like Sarah was trying to ruin my night.",

        "text": "Little backstory: I\u2019ve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Florida\ud83d\ude2b. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he\u2019d talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. \n\nFlash forward 13 years (I\u2019m 30) and I\u2019m getting married to my fianc\u00e9 Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I\u2019s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he\u2019s wanted to \u201ctalk to me about this for a long time\u201d\n\nHe went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn\u2019t \u201cwhat god wants\u201d. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right that we\u2019re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won\u2019t be coming to the wedding because he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to have to explain to her what was going on here\u201d.\n\nNotice he only said that SHE wasn\u2019t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad\u2019s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I\u2019ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. \n\nI think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they\u2019re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they\u2019ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. \n\nI told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we\u2019re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren\u2019t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\n\nEdit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between \u201cyoure the asshole, he\u2019s family. Invite him\u201d and \u201che\u2019s the asshole, fuck him. Don\u2019t invite him\u201d. I\u2019m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn\u2019t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own. \n\nAnd no my story isn\u2019t fake. I recorded the conversation",

        "text": "Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. \n\nIn my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. \n\nIt came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. \n\nTonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. \n\nAfter not much googling at all I found \"our\" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. \n\nThis leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. \n\nI think this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I shared this knowledge with my mom?",

We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. \n\nWhen my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn\u2019t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. \n\nSince I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that\u2019s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I\u2019m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. \n\nI moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we\u2019ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I\u2019m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. \n\nFor the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don\u2019t. She keeps telling me that \u2018even if I don\u2019t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they\u2019re innocent in all this\u2019 \n\nAITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can\u2019t forgive her though.",

At the time, Dan had multiple college options which he was going to decline to stay in our town and marry Fran. I obviously didn't support this, I wanted my son to go to college and knew he wanted that too as he'd always been ambitious. I told my son that he had his whole life ahead of him and he could get married later, but didn't need to rush it. I told him that if he went to college and waited, even just a year or two, I'd pay for his tuition. At the time I didn't know how serious their relationship was as they'd been together for a little over a year, and was scared it wouldn't work out and he'd waste this opportunity. My son happily accepted this offer and agreed with me that it would be best to wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year my son graduated college but maintained a long distance relationship with Fran, and they announced their engagement a couple months ago. We were all ecstatic about it. Sometime between then and now, my son told Fran that I was the reason he waited until now to propose. I wasn't aware until Christmas when during dinner, Fran said she wanted to say something. She began saying I paid my son to not married her and actively tried to ruin their relationship. She then said she was blessed that 'evil hadn't won' and couldn't wait to have a long and happy marriage. Everyone was silent and didn't really know what to say. My son approached me later to apologise and said she had twisted his words but it's been constantly weighing on my mind as friends and family present all have different opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**\n\nIf my son had married Fran out of high school, he wouldn't of gone to college. My son chose to go to a school so far away, there were closer options but he liked the school he chose. I will be showing Dan this thread and update if he responds. Fran currently works at her mothers bakery. She wants to be a SAHM once they get married and was waiting for Dan to come back home.\n\n**Update**\n\nDan and Fran have talked and cleared the air around this situation. Fran feels awful about what she said and realised she should've come and talked to me privately. This situation however has brought up other issues between the two and their future, as Dan expressed the Fran he would like to go to law school. Fran wants them to start their life together and thinks it's unfair for Dan to make them wait for 4+ years. Dan is currently home and we will be dealing with this together. Thank you for all the advice, Dan has read this thread and is now feeling unsure about their relationship.",

        "text": "I\u2019m a 41M single dad with a 13 year old daughter Lacey. My wife died in childbirth and it\u2019s just been me and Lacey all her life. My sister has been a big help in raising Lacey, and we do keep in contact with her maternal grandparents. \n\nThe issue started a couple of months ago when Lacey started her period. I knew this day would come so I spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. I gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, I buy her pads and tampons, I even have midol and heating pads ready for Lacey when she needs them. \n\nThe problem began when I began to notice a smell coming from Lacey\u2019s room. I went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. I checked her bathroom and it was worse. She had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.\n\nI took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but I didn\u2019t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. Later, I noticed bloodstains on the couch. It took a while of cleaning but I got them out. I figured that was the end of that.\n\nIt happened again last month, when I noticed Lacey\u2019s room was stinking again. And I saw she didn\u2019t even wash the underwear from before. The bathroom was unbearable at this point. Then earlier this week, I saw bloodstains on the couch again.\n\nI sat Lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. And to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. I also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. I also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and I wouldn\u2019t be upset if I saw her bloodstained items being washed.\n\nLacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren\u2019t gross and that I was period shaming and that I needed to educate myself on menstruation. I then got texts from my sister and MIL scolding me for making Lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. \n\nBut I honestly wasn\u2019t trying to convey that periods are gross. I was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. I just wanted to make sure that Lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that I wouldn\u2019t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items \n\nAITA here? Was I period shaming my daughter?\n\nEDIT:  so I\u2019ve mentioned it in a few comments. I talked to my sister and mil and explained my side. They apologized for misunderstanding and like you guys, have given some good cleaning tips and they\u2019ll talk to Lacey and help her out with the pads and tampons too\n\nEDIT2: so many people here have suggested it and I\u2019ve asked Lacey if her period pain is unbearable or just normal cramps, and left the choice to her as to whether or not she wants to see a specialist but the option is there for her!\n\nEDIT3: We have washed the sheets with hydrogen peroxide and purchased some oxyclean for future instances should we need it. Many of you have also suggested period underwear, which again, I have asked her aunt and grandmother about and they\u2019ll be able to give her more info about those as well as different hygiene products she can use.",

        "text": "I (32F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 3 years. We dated for 2 years before that. I want to start this off by saying that he really is a good guy in other areas. \n\nMy husband\u2019s parents, his 2 brothers (ages 38 and 40ish), and his brothers\u2019 girlfriends/fianc\u00e9es have a tradition of going out to dinner once a month. I am invited about 50% of the time. I\u2019ve talked to my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and she says she is invited every time. \n\nWhen I say I\u2019m not invited, I mean that my husband tells me \u201cI\u2019m going to the family dinner. It\u2019s probably best if you sit this one out.\u201d When I expressed that I wanted to come, he told me that it would be for the best if I didn\u2019t. It has caused several fights.\n\nAbout a week ago, my husband went to a family dinner that I wasn\u2019t invited to. I was very pissed. So earlier that day, I called and made a reservation at the restaurant they were going to. My husband left the house, not knowing about my reservations, and I left 15 minutes after him. \n\nI ended up seated at a table where I couldn\u2019t see his family. So I got up as if I was going to the bathroom and walked right past them. They were all there, including his brothers\u2019 SOs. My husband looked completely shocked and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had just been dying for a steak, so I came and got one at the restaurant. \n\nMy mother in law said it was very rude of me to interrupt their family dinner. I pointed out that I wasn\u2019t trying to join them, I was just going to the bathroom. I told them to have a good meal and I left. I went and finished my steak by myself.\n\nMy husband was really pissed when he came home, and he told me that he couldn\u2019t believe how much of an asshole I had been. I said that he was an asshole for not inviting me to his dinners when his brothers\u2019 SOs got to go. My husband said that the decision to invite was between him and his family, and I should respect it. \n\nAnyway, with the way the word asshole was thrown around, it made me think of this sub. So I wanted to ask if I am the asshole. Am I?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know how to add an update in this sub, so there is an update posted to my profile",

        "text": "Okay, I know how this sounds. Please hear me out at least.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to \u201cimpress\u201d my boyfriend. I\u2019ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is\u2026 I try too hard? She has also insisted I\u2019ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I\u2019ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.\n\nLate last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend\u2019s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I\u2019d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn\u2019t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she\u2019s continued to contact and harass me.\n\nThis leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I\u2019m okay with that and I\u2019m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it\u2019s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She\u2019s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a \u201cNasty Serbian half breed.\u201d I\u2019m not Serbian and she\u2019s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.\n\nThen came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they\u2019d received \u201cmultiple\u201d claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. \n\nI\u2019m now at a point where I\u2019ve realised I literally cannot do this. I\u2019m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it\u2019s a crime in the UK) and I\u2019m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don\u2019t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn\u2019t back off and she\u2019s pretty much mocking me and saying I won\u2019t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she\u2019s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don\u2019t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.\n\nWIBTA here if I did this?\n\nEdit: When I say I need to care for my boyfriend, I mean he\u2019s essentially immobile, he\u2019s not being unsupportive, he\u2019s just barely able to take care of himself, let alone battle his mother too.",

It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.\n\nAfter struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I start pre-making meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is \"whatever\". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.\n\n\nWell, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be \"expected\" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him after he complains I'm not doing enough and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.\n\nHe comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.",

She added that the lunches I\u2019m packing my son are \u201cvery distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.\u201d I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son\u2019s preferences. \n\nThe usual lunch that I send him to school with is small celery sticks with blue cheese and goat cheese, kimchi and spam (we are Korean and he absolutely adores this dish), and spicy Doritos marinated in Sriracha (I know, I know, but he deserves a snack, and I don\u2019t put that many chips in the baggy.) \n\nI ended the call by saying that I very much appreciated her worries, but that at the end of the day, I am not going to drastically change my sons\u2019 lunches all of a sudden, and that it\u2019s not my fault if other students are \u201cdistracted\u201d by his meal. It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches. \n\nThe teacher sent an Email to me an hour ago saying that my response was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that his lunches are \u201cjust too inappropriate to be sent to school any longer.\u201d I haven\u2019t responded yet and don\u2019t want to.

        "text": "So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.\n\nI knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nThese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.\n\nSuffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.\n\nI've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to \"work it out\" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to \"Reconcile\" i've shut it down,\n\nMy friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",

        "text": "I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\n\nI'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).\n\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.\n\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. \n\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\n\nUpdate: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",

        "text": "I (25f) fucking hate wearing bras. They're uncomfortable, constricting, and expensive. With work from home, I spent the last year and a half basically never wearing a bra and got used to it. Quite frankly, my boobs are nonexistent anyways.\n\nI recently started going to the gym again and started working out braless. I should note that up until now, no one has ever pointed out anything wrong with me not wearing a bra. However, in the middle of a set of squats (yes, MID SQUAT),  a guy comes up to me, taps me on the shoulder to get my attention, and tells me that my nipples are poking through my shirt. I get really irritated because why tf is this guy staring at my nipples in the first place and then stopping me mid-set to inform me?\n\nI get really annoyed, try to finish my set, but then this fucker literally grabs the bar, as I ascend and re-racks it for me. He claimed it looked like I was having trouble with the last rep, and that he had come over to make sure I could do it, then noticed my nipples. I'm really fucking pissed off at this point and told him I didn't need his help finishing my set and why the fuck was he looking at my chest in the first place?? He said he was going to spot me, but then noticed my chest and thought it'd be inappropriate.\n\nI pointed out that the safety bar was set, so even if I did fail the set, he wasn't needed. But he just insisted people at gyms look out for each other, and that going forward, I should probably wear a bra so other people wouldn't get uncomfortable and that it may help me stay more balanced in my squats. I'm literally the only girl at the weights section of the gym at the moment, and other guys who were squatting and failed sets never have to worry about this shit. I've seen guys fail multiple sets in a row and no one ever rushes to their aid, but I have a very slight pause, and everyone thinks I need rescuing. So I'm now really annoyed and also kind of uncomfortable that this guy I've never spoken to in my life thinks he's helping me and then has the audacity to tell me how to dress.\n\nSo I tell him \"You have bigger boobs and nipples than I do. Maybe YOU should wear a bra so people won't get uncomfortable and you won't fail your squats.\" He then got really defensive, saying he was just trying to help, then called me a bitch. Honestly I'm not sure if I overreacted, but I'm still kind of pissed off so maybe that's clouding my judgment. AITA?\n\nEdit to add: I'm not sure if people think I'm walking around and it's extremely obvious my nipples are showing. I actually really hate constricting clothes. My t-shirt size is x-small but I wear size large to the gym (and pretty much everywhere lately), and you can't tell my stomach from my chest. My nipples might've been showing a little more while squatting because I was wearing a lifting belt\n\n&#x200B;",

Gary treats his son \u201cIan\u201d (19M) like he\u2019s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to \u201cmake the transition easier for everyone.\u201d Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn\u2019t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn\u2019t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn\u2019t affect me at all.\n\nMy dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He\u2019s home now and he\u2019s offering to have me come live with him. I\u2019m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I\u2019d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn\u2019t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven\u2019t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary\u2019s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because \u201dI wasn\u2019t family\u201d so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn\u2019t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. \n\nShe\u2019s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I\u2019m being.  Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I\u2019m treating them and how I\u2019m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let\u2019s face facts here, you don\u2019t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he\u2019d see her there. Now she\u2019s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I\u2019m the asshole for \u201cmaking things hard\u201d for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back.

Most of his family are decent people but his mom can be a little of a passive-aggressive and tends to criticize me a lot. Shaun sees it as \"her still not getting used to me being around\" but IDK because she treats his ex \"Julissa\" good. MIL says that Julissa has been around the family for age and her past with Shaun never affected her relationship with her. Fine, I never minded her attending every holiday and being around til yesterday.\n\n\nWe had Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house. Shaun went there before me and when I arrived it was already dinner time. Everyone was seated and I saw that all chairs were taken. I asked MIL why she didn't save me a seat and she said \"sorry\" and that one of her granddaughters decided to show up last minute and the chair was taken. I looked at her then at Julissa who was sitting next to shaun and tried to point out how I was more deserving of her chair since I'm the DIL (I know shouldn't have said it I know..I know) MIL flatout said that Julissa is as much FAMILY as me, and that it was rude to imply otherwise. Julissa was nodding confidently while glancing at me. I was so upset I wanted to leave but decided to just sit on my husband's lap and act as casual as possible. I sat on his lap asking if he was okay with it (don't worry I'm petite, he's strong built) and started eating so casually while smiling and complimenting the food and mentioning to Shaun how warm and comfortable his lap was now and then. The table went awkwardly silence. BIL would try to break the silence and change the subject but it somehow goes back to being awkward. MIL AND Julissa were barely eating and were staring at each other than at me eyes wide open.\n\n\nMinutes later, Julissa excused herself to the bathroom and so did MIL. It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward. She said it wasn't her fault chairs were taken and I could've dragged a chair from the kitchen but acted childishly and made Julissa (and family) uncomfortable with how inappropriate I was.\n\n\nEDIT: I need to mention that even if I took a chair from the kitchen. There was not enough space at dinner table to fit the chair. Everyone was sitting next to each other.",

        "text": "Throwaway.\n\nMy girlfriend, \u201cRose,\u201d and I have been together for 4 years and she is 5 months pregnant with our first child. My mum seemed to really like Rose (or at the very least tolerated her) - but after we announced that we were expecting, something definitely switched in her. \n\nShe has become extremely rude and disrespectful towards my girlfriend. She makes passive-aggressive comments at every chance she gets. I\u2019ve had to take a step back from my mother until she fixes her behaviour.\n\nRose had gone to visit her family who lives far out of town. It was a very last-minute trip, and she drove herself to the destination and back. Unfortunately, at around 6pm, her car broke down and she was forced to pull over. Fortunately, my brother, \u201cChris,\u201d who\u2019s great with cars and lives about an hour and \u00bd from where Rose was stranded, was willing to pick her up and sorted everything out. I was out of the country, so I\u2019m grateful that my brother sorted everything out for her.\n\nChris moved back in with my mum about a year ago. Obviously, the situation wasn\u2019t the best, especially considering the tension between Rose and my mom that exists for no particular reason, but I hoped my mum could put her pettiness aside for at least a night.\n\nIt was too late for Chris to drive Rose back home, so my brother told her that he would drive her back tomorrow morning. An arrangement that my mum seems to not like, but one that she managed to keep her mouth shut about (my girlfriend tells me)\n\nRose helps prepare dinner, wash up, and actually engage in a decent conversation with my mum for the first time in ages. However, they mostly avoid each other. Chris goes to bed earlier, leaving my mum and Rose.\n\nMy mum lives in a two-bedroom apartment and since both bedrooms were taken. Rose assumed that she would be sleeping on the couch.\n\nShe apparently assumed wrong.\n\nMy mum gives Rose the thinnest blanket ever and basically screams at her, telling her that she has to sleep on the floor to not \u201cruin her couch.\u201d She tells Rose to \u201cmake do,\u201d with the pillows on the couch and the blanket that provides zero warmth. \n\nRose thought about protesting, but ultimately decided against it. According to Rose, my mum kept opening her door to check if she was sleeping on the couch, so she couldn\u2019t even try to sleep on the couch.\n\nAt 5am, Chris found Rose on the couch and let her sleep on his bed. He ended up telling me, but told me to not make a \u201cbig fuss out of it.\u201d\n\nI did the exact opposite.\n\nI called my mum, very angry, and told her that she was disrespecting her so badly. She tried to defend herself by saying, \u201cthat she didn\u2019t harm the baby,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s okay for pregnant women to sleep on the floor,\u201d but I Refused to hear any of it. Chris agrees with me, but told me that I shouldn\u2019t make it a fight. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. AITA?",

        "text": "Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.\n\nThat was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would \"basically be the same thing\". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for \"shaming him and his wife on the internet\". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",

We\u2019re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds.

Let\u2019s drop it.\n\nMIL: Well, I don\u2019t care. \n\nHusband: Again, drop it.\n\nMIL: I hope it happens!\n\nHusband: Thankfully we\u2019re very careful.\n\nMIL: Accidents happen. It isn\u2019t always up to you.\n\nHusband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?\n\nWe do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.\n\nUntil SIL says, \u201cVasectomies can fail, you know! It\u2019s not a 100% thing.\u201d\n\nIt gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.\n\nMIL: So there\u2019s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!\n\nHusband & I lock eyes. Party\u2019s over.\n\nMe: That is exactly what abortions are for.\n\nCue screaming and yelling, I\u2019m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.\n\nHusband yells at them to GTFO, don\u2019t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.\n\nHusband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it\u2019s what BOTH of us would want.\n\nParty\u2019s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL\u2019s post tags us, says: \u201cWe were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.\u201d\n\nI do not feel like we\u2019re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn\u2019t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line. \n\nReddit, we are the assholes here?",

That being said, I have a tendency to go off my meds when I\u2019m manic. It\u2019s not fun when the meds wean out of my system and I go nuts. In order to not sabotage myself, I take my meds everyday at 11 am. It helps me settle myself for the rest of the day, and keeps me on a strict schedule. \n\nIncident:\n\nMy workplace has shifted online fully. We had a zoom call yesterday with HR to update everybody on COVID measures going forward for the upcoming quarter and it was about 30 or so people on the call. HR has been anal retentive about people keeping their videos on throughout the meeting; nobody is allowed to move out of the screen. The meeting began at 9 am. \n\n11 am comes around and my alarm buzzes to remind me about the medication. I moved slightly out of frame and took them while still on the call. I didn\u2019t think anybody noticed but apparently this senior HR person we\u2019ll call Q, did. \n\nThe meeting wraps up at 12 noon, and as we\u2019re all getting ready to sign off, Q tells me to stay behind after everybody leaves, in front of them. \n\nI found that unprofessional but held my tongue. \n\nQ then launched on this long diatribe about how I\u2019m setting a \u201chostile work environment\u201d by taking my meds during work hours, that I\u2019m being neglectful of my duties, and that I\u2019m \u201cruining my body\u201d with them. \n\nWhen I finally got a chance to respond, I said that the \u201cdrugs\u201d I\u2019m taking are prescription medication, and that I fail to see how the five seconds it takes me to take them is creating a hostile work environment. I said that my medical history is none of their business, and since they have failed to demonstrate any real harm in the situation, I didn\u2019t feel like this discussion was warranted. \n\nQ looked like they\u2019d swallowed sour milk and told me they\u2019d be writing me up and that I was officially being warned for my behavior. \n\nI saw red and right after the call ended, sent an email to the head of HR (R) summarizing the conversation and refuting the warning/write ups. I stated the relevant legal protections accorded to employees in such situations and that I hoped R would address this fairly. \n\nR looked into the matter and I learned later that Q had been suspended without pay. \n\nA bunch of my coworkers caught onto what happened, and are now making it very difficult to work with them. Apparently Q was a popular person in the office and they felt that complaining to the head of HR was taking it too far. \n\nThis entire situation feels utterly surreal and I can\u2019t think of any reason why I\u2019d be the asshole, but I\u2019m facing an uncomfortable work situation and want to know if I need to apologize and smooth things over.",

Everything was pretty much wrapped up till he said he no longer wanted any part of our kids' lives (5m) and (12f). I didn't argue with him about it since I already know what it's like having a parent who doesn't want you around or wants to be in your life. I asked what he wanted me to tell the kids and he just said \"whatever you think is best I don't care. I don't want to parent anymore.\" Everything was in agreement and signed with no fuss.\n\nA few weeks later I get a call from my ex Mil asking if we could meet each other. When I came over she broke down crying and begging to let my ex see his kids again. I was confused about what she meant because not once did he contact me after meeting the lawyer. She went on about how my ex said \"he really missed them and that I was just a petty b*tch for taking full custody.\" Also that he was crying for days about it. I told her my version of events and she called it bs saying her son wouldn't lie like that especially not about his kids. Then I decided to call him in front of her. He didn't know she and I were meeting that day.\n\nI said \"hey (5m) has a soccer game in a few days (which he did) and I was wondering if you wanted to go? I know he'd really love it and be happy to see you.\" He instantly said \"No. I already said I'm not doing this anymore.\" I raised my voice a bit saying \"well what about holidays and birthdays because we never discussed any of it and your family might want to see them.\" He just said \" my family already thinks the kids aren't mine anyways so it doesn't matter.\" I asked\"well how do you think this is going to effect Denise (his mom)? She is over the moon about them.\" He just said \" She loves me more than the kids so I doubt this will be an issue for her.\" After a bit more talking we finally hung up. Ex Mil was straight faced and nodded at everything that just happened saying \"mmm okay.\" She asked me to leave and said we would be in touch.\n\nLater that day I got a call from my ex saying how it's my fault he was kicked out of his mom's house and possibly will be taken off her will. Also that none of his family members will talk to him because of what ex Mil heard. He threw a lot of insults at me before I hung up and now him and his mates keep calling and texting me. My friend is saying I shouldn't have said anything in the first place and I ruined his life.\n\nEdition: hello thank you for your support and the gold reward. Yes, I plan to let Denise see the kids because I know she just wants to give them the world along with the rest of his family. (I was honestly confused with what op meant at first and my daughter told me overpowered like in anime but my sister clarified.)\n\n2nd edition: hello again, I want to address something because this keeps coming up and I can't keep up with everyone. Due to actions he and I took when we were younger my Christian parents thought it would be best he and I be married at the time.",

My wife made the difficult decision to have an induction abortion. The procedure itself went as expected, and she is physically fine. Emotionally, we are both still grieving. I was with her the whole time.\n\nYesterday, we had a family gathering. My family knew we were expecting, and I had the horrible job of telling them we had lost the baby. My parents and sister expressed their sympathies. However, bil, who is extremely pro-life, throughout the night told my wife repeatedly her that she was a murderer and that she killed her own daughter, and all sorts of other awful things that made her feel much worse. I was appalled when I caught him doing this, and my wife was on the verge of breaking down all over.\n\nI yelled at him, pointing out how he had gotten a DUI in the past that put another person in the hospital, how he was working a low-paying job selling cigarettes that kill thousands of people every year at a convenience store, and how I had needed to bail him and my sister out financially more than once for medical reasons. Then I ended with \"If anything, you're a walking advertisement for abortion. Your mother probably wishes she had aborted you.\"\n\nI took my wife home, furious. Then later, I got a call from my sister. She apologized initially, saying she realized what her husband had said was out of line, but then tried to justify it by pointing out that he was raised to believe abortion was wrong. I should have been more understanding, and it was unfair of me to point out his past struggles when he had been doing better recently. I cussed her out and hung up, but now I'm wondering if I did go too far? AITA for basically telling my brother in law he should have been aborted?\n\nUpdate: thank you all so much for the support. My sister called me a few hours ago, and we talked. It turns out she didn't know what he had actually said. He made it seem like he had just said he disagreed with abortion, which I would say is still unacceptable to tell grieving parents. But when I told her what he actually said, she was horrified. She apologized profusely and is now considering leaving him (there were a lot of other red flags in their relationship). She's now fully on our side and can't believe her husband could be so vile",

We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.\n\nWhen I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. \n\nBut after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, \"Dirty little sheet heads!\" became his favorite punchline.\n\nThe final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.\n\nThe wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident. My only feeling was, honestly, relief. I went to his funeral and didn't say anything at the service, but at dinner Jake's little sister approached me and said she'd started dating a soldier and wanted to know if I had any advice. My advice? \"Don't. The military ruined Jake and turned the man I loved into a drunk, abusive asshole.\"\n\nJake's family predictably erupted in a firestorm, but more alarmingly to me, my own parents have taken their side.\n\nAITA?",

Maybe because we don't live together and he don't visit often.\n\n\nThe other day he and his friends came over to my place to celebrate his birthday. They got drunk and started throwing the sofas pillows at each others. I told them to stop then went into the kitchen to clean up.\n\nI then started hearing loud noise, I walked out the kitchen and saw my model ship in my boyfriend's hands. I rushed to get it but he passed it on to his friend, and then his friend passed it on to the other friend.\n\nI started running around trying to catch it while yelling at them to stop then my boyfriend grabbed it again. I was so angry I told him to hand it over but he said I needed to kiss him first. I yelled at him and he tried to threw it to his friend who tried to catch it but it missee and hit the wall and broke.\n\nI lost it!! kicked all of his friend out then had a fight with him telling him this was a sentimental item from dad and demanded that he pay me $3,500 because this is how much it costs. He left then called in the morning asking if I was serious about wanting him to pay $3,500 and I said I was dead serious. He started making excuses saying he was drunk and also, I never told him about this ship and how important it was for me before both monetarily and sentimentally so that's on me. we had another fight and then I hung up upon telling him I'm expecting the 3,500 and that I wasn't afraid to take the legal route if I have to. He kept texting asking me to let it go and saying it was cruel of me to threaten him with the law. he had his friends apologize thinking this would be it but I insisted that he pay me.\n\nI get that I might've got worked up over an item and treated my boyfriend badly but to me it seemed like recklessness on his part.

        "text": "I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat. I couldn't stand her.\n\nI call her \"his ex\" to myself and others. He called her \"his friend\".\n\nWe're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. \n\nI've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.\n\nThe way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was \"important\". \n\nA couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me \"That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.\" \n\nWhen we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked \"Why would us getting married affect my friendships?\"\n\nI sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.\n\nHe'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. \n\nThe few times I brought it up he said \"We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.\"\n\nShe died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.\n\nHe was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him \"You don't think you're going, do you?\"\n\nMy argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his \"she's my friend\" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.\n\nHe was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's \"willing to burn this to the fucking ground\" while holding up his wedding band. \"Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.\"\n\nHim, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a \"ghoul\" for how I've reacted.\n\nI never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. \n\nAITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",

He's 16. He and his step sister get along well. No arguing, no yelling even better than most siblings I know which is great and it's quite a relief to see them loving and respecting each other.\n\nWe have two bathrooms in the house. My daughter only uses the smaller one. Since it's always available unlike the main bathroom that me, my stepson and wife often use.\n\nI've recently received some money and decided to renovate the small bathroom that my daughter uses since she complained about things needing to be fixed. I started the renovation 2 days ago. While my daughter uses the main bathroom as an alternative. There were no issues until my wife pulled me aside saying my daughter's been leaving period products inside the bathroom and it wasn't right cause my stepson would see them. I asked my wife for more clarification and turns out my daughter gets rid of her used pads by putting them in the trashcan inside the bathroom. I told my wife there was nothing wrong with that so what's the problem. She gave me a look. Called me an ignorant then dropped it.\n\nThis morning she looked upset and told me my stepson went inside the bathroom after my daughter got out and probably saw her used pads in the bathroom. I asked if she meant the trashcan and it was confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me to ask my daughter to stop using the main bathroom even though the small one is still in the process of being renovated. I absolutely lost my shit and told her she was making a ridiculously unreasonable demand. Told her it's my daughter's house too. Where is she supposed to go if she can't use both bathrooms?. We started arguing back and forth until she said she'd talk to her but I told her to stop it. She just kept giving me the cold shoulder for hours now even though my stepson said nothing about this \"issue\" as she claims it to be.\n\nMy wife said she was trying to be a parent but I treat her as an outsider to my daughter. That's not true. I might've been harsh on her but in my opinion she wasn't trying to parent she was being unreasonable. I might be wrong I just don't see her point.\n\nAMITA Here!?\n\nMy wife is an incredibly private person but that doesn't mean she can get others to follow.\n\nTo answer your question: The trashcan we have has a lid. It's a step on trashcan that doesn't require hands.\nMy stepson isn't even aware of what his mom's talking about. He can barely look around he always has his phone glued to his face and he doesn't pay attention to anything.",

Sorry for not answering any of them, the post got big really quick and I guess I got overwhelmed.\n\nSo to answer a few questions, why didn\u2019t I cancel his orders?\n\nI would get emails from ups and from there, I can only change the location of the package. I believe if I wanted to cancel it, it would have to be from the company itself. I tried emailing them but they said that it was an honest mistake from the other guy so there was no need to cancel (it wasn\u2019t an honest mistake, it was like the 10th time it happened)\n\nAnother question was, why 20 miles away?\n\nThat\u2019s the furthest location it was able to give me for some reason so I figured I\u2019d stick with it.\n\nOk so now for the update.\n\nHe ended up messaging me again and called me out once again saying I\u2019m an asshole and I ruined his day by making him drive 20 miles both ways. \n\nI just said that it\u2019s exhausting getting emails that should be for him and that as long as he keeps using mine, I\u2019ll be putting his packages further and further away (I can\u2019t actually do more miles, it was just to scare him)\n\nI also used the analogy many of you wrote in the comments. \u201cIt takes less time to correct the email then to drive 20 miles\u201d\n\nI think this really opened up his eyes because on the next message he sent me, he apologized and said that I was right, it shouldn\u2019t happen again.\n\nAll in all, I think things went relatively smooth. I\u2019m hoping that it doesn\u2019t happen again or else I\u2019ll just change the location once again haha\n\nTL;DR: He apologized for using my email, says it won\u2019t happen again",

I overheard them talking and when I entered the room they went silent. I waited til my brother left then talked to my boyfriend, he denied having this conversation with my brother first then, admitted to installing the app on the phone. I told him he and my brother were in the wrong because this is huge breach of privacy. he said he has nothing to do with it and advised me to stay out of it as well. but I said I want to tell my brother's fianc\u00e8e. my boyfriend argued with me about being nosy and intrusive and told me to stay out of it and let them deal with their own issues. But I thought that was unfair to my future sister in law since she's the one working, paying bills and rent and this is how she is treated? My boyfriend told me gtfo with this attitude and again, said I should stay of it because it does not in any way concern me. I don't know I feel horrible after hearing about what my brother did and since I have a good relationship with his fiancee I can't help but feel guilty and wanting to tell her.\n\n\nAITA for wanting to tell her?",

One of the parents at the other table came over and started tearing into me about \"how cranky and mean i was and how dare I yell at her kid, who was just playing\" meanwhile her and the other middle aged forty something parents are letting their kids run amok and be loud and obnoxious while my friend and I are trying to enjoy a night out.\n\nI ripped her a new one and said \"How entitled do you need to be to think it's ok to let your kids just crawl under other people's tables?\" She called me an asshole and walked away in a huff.",

Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.\nRecently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her \u201cKah-Nye\u201d. She told me that she told the teacher \u201cMy name Kanae. It\u2019s three claps (syllables)\u201d. But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.\nDuring my daughters sports day I \u201cconfronted\u201d the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called \u201cKaa-naa-eh\u201d. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way it\u2019s \u201csupposed to be\u201d but will try her best to remember.\nToday, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  \n\nI\u2019m considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?\n\n\n\n(For some clarity; I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )\n\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdNot like Kanye West\n\nBut Kah. Plus Nye like Bill Nye \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffc\n\n:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didn\u2019t expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I can\u2019t reply to them all. But this morning we couldn\u2019t go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didn\u2019t care.  We don\u2019t want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::\n\u26e9\u26e9\nUpdate: I\u2019m not sure where else to place it:::\n\nBut my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. \nWe told the principal everything that I\u2019ve told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.\n\nSo then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.\n\nMore apologizes were issued when we told them\nwe spoke English. \n\nWe were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.\n\nThey principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. I\u2019m hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9aFinal (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didn\u2019t expect everyone there. \n\nIt was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didn\u2019t sound natural and she made several mistakes)\n\nI don\u2019t remember it word for word but it said \n\n\u201c I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).\u201d\nThe teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.\nShe also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. \n\nHonestly the only \u201creal\u201d thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said \u201cKanae. I am really sorry\u201d. \nIt seemed heartfelt \n\nKanae being Kanae made the teacher a card\n\nI forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.\n\nBut my daughter feels better \n\nThank you all so much",

        "text": "Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help \"sponsor\" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.\n\nOther than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: \"So did we get a turkey?\"\n\nI looked at him and said \"Well, I know I didn't. Did you?\"\n\nHe stared at me blankly and said \"No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?\"\n\nI shrugged and said \"I don't know nothing about no turkey.\"\n\nThe kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said \"I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.\"\n\nHe blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.\n\nI said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?\n\nHe just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his \"office\" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.\n\nSo I just looked at him and said \"Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?\"\n\nHe told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.\n\nBefore you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.\n\nAITA?\n\n**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was \"getting down on the floor playing\" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.\n\nAnyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.\n\nThe kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.\n\nAlso, we don't do Christmas. \n\nCheck your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened.",

She got a wig and started wearing it, I don't mind it, I 100% support her since she only wears it around family and friends.\n\nMy sister lost her apartment after a messy divorce and moved in with her twin daughters (16) almost a month ago. Things been going well except my nieces constant remarks about my wife's wig. They got so hung up on it and kept asking lots of questions about it. They asked to take turns to try it on, suggested they \"strighten\" it with the strightner and so on which was exhausting. They even pressured to see her without it but my wife was uncomfortable and refused.\n\n\nYesterday I got home and found that my wife was locking herself in the bedroom and crying. I asked what happened, She told me she woke up and didn't find her wig, then discovered my nieces took it and hid then urged her to come out so they could see her without it. My wife repeatedly asked them to give it back but they started laughing and recording , my wife got had to lock the door to keep a distance cause they didn't stop. I was fuming I went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but I was able to get the wig back. I lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. They said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. My sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. I told her her daughters were recording her! She saw nothing wrong in it and said I overreacted as well. I lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave. I later let them know about the eviction since they thought I wasn't serious and they started crying begging that I let it go. But my wife is no longer comfortable around them after what they did.\nMy sister called our eldery dad and he begged that I let them stay and insisted my nieces were just acting like typical teenagers. He offered to speak to my wife but I declined.\n\nThey've been begging that I chang my mind but I ket refusing. aita?",

        "text": "My sister (35f) and her husband (37m) have been struggling with infertility since they got married 12 years ago. They've tried absolutely everything, from medical to spiritual, but unfortunately, nothing works. Now that she's approaching late 30s, they're starting to look into adoption, but it's also been a slow going, since their financial condition isn't exactly stable from multiple rounds of fertility treatments they went through. I can only imagine the struggle, and I sympathize with her, but the stress this situation is bringing her and her husband honestly puts a strain on our relationship.\n\nMy husband and I (both 30) lost our best friends, Mason and his wife, Kate, two weeks ago in a horrible car accident. They left behind their son Pete, who isn't even two yet. It was so sudden and so heart-wrenching. We're still grieving, which lowers out contact with a lot of people, including my sister and BIL. Our main concern right now is ourselves and Pete, whose custody has come to us because we're both his godparents, actively engaged in Pete's life since his birth, and because Mason and Kate have neither left a Will nor have immediate living relatives who can take him in.\n\nWe've decided to adopt Pete as soon as we can stomach the process. My husband and I never planned on having kids, and even if we did, this is absolutely not the way we want to go about it. The situation is far from ideal, but we're starting the adoption process yesterday, for Pete's safety if nothing else. We broke the news to our extended families and friends, letting them know that my husband and I won't be very available for a little longer because of this.\n\nI know my sister and BIL will have something to say about this. I'm prepared for a few heated text messages or voice mails. However, I didn't expect them to turn up on our doorstep, crying about how \"unfair\" it is that we were given everything they wanted, and how we didn't deserve to be parents because we didn't go through what they had to. I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits. We kicked them off of our porch, and I told my sister before she left that since our pain inconveniences her so much, I won't have her around me and my family at all anymore.\n\nI know she made a fuss about it, and now everyone has something to say to us. We turned off our phones, so we don't know which ones are cursing us and which one aren't. I know some did/are. My husband and I are both in pain and grieving, and we can't trust ourselves to be objective. Did we go to far?\n\nEdit: I originally did not want to put this information in, because I don't want everyone to point at it and say this is the reason we're not in the wrong. For the sake of disclosure: My husband and I are both men. No, this is not a case of homophobia. My sister, for all her fault, was the first person to accept me for who I love, and I will not hear a single word about this in the comment. ",

Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. \n\nWell, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. \n\nSadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. \n\nThe issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. \n\nLater, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.\n\nWe got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.\n\nSis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. \n\nC has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. \n\nI took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. \n\nI explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. \n\nC told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have \"ruined her future\" for a \"free\" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. \n\nI pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. \n\nThe character count is very limiting.\n\nEdit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's \"have fun at college\" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.\n\nEdit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was \"unfair\" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got \"nothing,\" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. \n\nHonestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. \n\nAs for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. \n\nI have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. \n\nAs for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. \n\nWe'll see what the next few monthd bring.",

        "text": "I am(30f) a musician, playing gigs and at an orchestra as a violinist. Rehearsals just resumed so orchestra is my main source of income atm. \n\nMy sister(26f) is a social worker, working 3days a week so minimal income but she adores her job. \n\nI live in a small 2 bedroom apartment (both rooms around 9-10sqr meters), using the second room as a practice room/storage for my instruments (3violins, 2 guitars, a digital piano, a small drum kit), and other stuff. \n\n4 months ago my sister broke up with her bf and I offered her my spare room, temporarily. I moved most of my stuff to the living room so I could fit a small bed in there. Sis moved in, but she asked me to move more stuff to the living room. I moved pretty much everything sans the piano, to the point where the living room became uninhabitable. \n\nThen she started complaining about my violin playing, saying it gave her headaches. I told her I couldn't stop the daily practice without risking my only steady income. The arguments got worse. She told me to play only when she wasn't home, but with her work schedule I couldn't afford that. I tried switching to the electric violin, but even that can be pretty loud so it didn't help. \n\nSeveral times I reminded her this was only a temporary arragement, but she didn't seem to hear me. \n\nTwo weeks ago I arrived home to finding my piano in the bathroom (near water and humidity!), because my sis needed the space for her new double bed. When I told her she can't srsly expect me to store my piano there, she said \"yeah, you will just have to sell it I guess\". I got so mad I told her she has 7 days to leave, but she didn't take me seriously. For a week I only talked to her to remind her how much time she has left, but she always laughed it off, told me to \"stop acting like a crazy person\". \n\nWhen the deadline came I boxed up all her stuff while she was at work, booked an rbnb bedsit close by and drove her stuff there. She was livid but couldn't do anything but take her new keys and stay there. \n\nThe following week she kept calling me with an increasingly apologetic tone, saying she shouldn't have moved my piano or bought a bed. She promised she would put more effort into finding a new place, and by the end of the week I considered most of our issues at least addressed, so I drove to help her move back. \n\nBut when I was carrying the first box down, she went \"I do hope you will at least stop with the violin this time. I absolutely refuse to take more of that f***ing violin.\" \n\nI dropped the box, wished her good luck and left. \n\nNow, two days later: on one hand it feels like a huge overreaction to leave my own sister literally homeless because of an argument about the violin (i know she cannot afford to stay there), but on the other hand I have no plans to allow her back here, because I feel she would just continue crossing boundaries and never leave. \n\nSo, AITA?",

        "text": "Tim and I met in an English literature class our junior year of college, and we\u2019ve been together the ten years since. While he ended up going into IT, I stayed in the liberal arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when I realized I didn\u2019t actually want to be a schoolteacher. Just to say that we always assumed he\u2019d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more I always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n\nI\u2019ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. To make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more niche areas. I recently started a new job as a consultant, making way more than I\u2019d ever anticipated. When I got the offer, I told Tim that the pay was \u201camazing\u201d, but he didn\u2019t ask about the actual amount and I didn\u2019t want to be braggy about it, especially since I was fairly sure it was above his current income.\n\nWell we just put in an application for a new place, and in the process of having to submit our paystubs it\u2019s become obvious that I make roughly 30% more than he does now. I expected him to think that was cool, since he\u2019s a feminist and has always been super supportive of my career. But instead he\u2019s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how I \u201ccheated the system\u201d to get where I am, that no English lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n\nHis major point is that I got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to \u201ctrample\u201d more qualified people who didn\u2019t have the same advantages. It\u2019s true that I got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody\u2019s daddy\u2019s firm. He also points out that at my first corporate job, I snagged a big promotion after volunteering to take on starting up the company\u2019s diversity/equity/inclusion program, and I\u2019ll admit that were I a white *man*, it\u2019s highly unlikely I would have been able to be the face of the eventually high-profile diversity program. Tim also notes that I was awarded a small college scholarship for being a \u201cpromising female writer\u201d, when no such scholarship existed for males.\n\nBut all that said\u2026I still don\u2019t feel like I cheated the system, and it makes me angry to listen to him \u201cjoke\u201d about it, especially since I grew up blue collar and worked fulltime while going to school fulltime to afford my degree. I reached a breaking point yesterday when he made a crack about how the new/first woman on his team is an obvious diversity hire. I told him that his jokes about women cheating the system to get ahead aren\u2019t funny or \u201cguy-talk ribbing\u201d as he says, they make him sound like an insecure little boy. He told me I was being a na\u00efve Karen and we haven\u2019t really talked since yesterday. Did I go too far?",

        "text": "Me and SIL, Daisy, have been friends since High School (15 years ago). I started dating her brother, Dan, when we were all in college. Daisy married Matt sometime after I married Dan 10 years ago. \n\nMatt and Daisy wanted a baby and starting trying right after marriage but they were having a lot of trouble. I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. \n\nI have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. \n\n3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. \n\n2 weeks before I was supposed to give birth, Dan passed away in an accident. I don't have any family except for Dan and Daisy. Daisy refused to attend the funeral because she will have to see me. The day before the funeral and I called her and begged her to come. I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. \n\nSoon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. \n\n2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said \"Ok\". She then asked \"Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?\"\n\nI pretty much said, \"I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. I don't care about Matt. I don't care that your baby died. Just leave me and my daughter alone.\" and then hung up. \n\nSince then she has been sending me multiple emails and vm's stating how awful I am and how heartless and how much Dan would be disappointed. I continued to just ignore everything. \n\nSo, AITA?. \n\nEdit: Please don't DM me about leaving a person homeless during pandemic. I am already aware of the fact. I don't care. No matter what anyone says I am not going to have any sympathy or help her in any way. I am only asking for a judgement on what I said and how I said it.\n\nEdit 2: I am getting a lot of annoying DM's because someone cross posted this somewhere else. Please stop. \n\nEdit 3: Please stop giving me unsolicited advise regarding changing my mind about helping her. That's not going to happen. If I wanted advice, I would have posted it in relationship_advice, not here. I only asked you to judge what I said to her and how I said it. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE. So, please stop.",

If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he\u2019s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don\u2019t like him.\n\nSo yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I\u2019d bring him something but I wasn\u2019t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.\n\nWhen I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he\u2019s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he\u2019s pissed that I \u201cnarc\u2019d\u201d and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn\u2019t worth getting him in trouble over.\n\nToday no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he\u2019s whining that we\u2019re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I\u2019m an asshole, but I don\u2019t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it\u2019s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I\u2019m an asshole.

I tried to be patient.\n\nYesterday we had planned to go out with some friends at night for dinner. Yesterday after I came back from work I was robbed in the bus and I had all my money and cards stolen. I cancelled my cards but the bank customer service  told me my new card with my new details (both physical card and the digital details for apple pay) would be available the following morning because the banks were closed that afternoon. So I had no money.\n\nWhen we went to dinner with my bf and friends I told my bf if he could just pay me back the money or at least pay for my meal since I have no money. He didn't exactly say yes or no, just a simple \"don't worry\". As we ordered he only ordered for himself and told me that he can't cover for mine at the moment so I better not order anything and just have some bites from his meal.\n\nI was so mad and frustrated because he had promised to give me back the money, he then claimed something came up and couldn't give them back but then ordered a nice meal for himself and just told me to get his scraps because he wouldn't pay me back or at least for my meal. I'd be the only one sitting there with no meal in front of me. I said this is ridiculous and I got up and left.\n\nOur friends now believe it was very low of me to get up and leave and how I should just be polite and stay there. I can't quite understand that logic but is there any way I am TA?",

        "text": "The title sounds awful but please read all the way til the end. DO NOT SPEED READ THIS. \n\nMy (22f)  sister \"Anna\" (21) is \"special need\". She has severe autism and while she is verbal most of her communication is \"physical\" like sign language  due to her social discomfort. She does speak around family though and has pretty bad cognitive skills. She can't comprehend boundaries and lives with our parents so they can best watch her. \n\nI am getting married in 3 months. We planned a simple wedding and reception at my fiance \"Michael's\" parents barn and farm. Since it's all gonna be DIY and we aren't planning anything too expensive,  we can do things pretty quickly since flowers, food and decor will be provided by his family. \n\nI sent out invites last week and I asked that Anna not come. I told my parents I understood that would mean they may not show up but it was just a heads up. Why no Anna? She has an issue with touching Michael and trying to kiss him. At times when we were at my parents house Anna would try and grab Michael's hands, try to lean in to kiss him or would have a really bad shutdowns if she wasn't allowed to be directly next to him. We've tried speaking to her but there's only so much we can do when she doesn't really understand. I told my parents I just want one day for Michael to be *my* partner and not Anna's comfort person. They called me selfish and asked how I expected them to agree to something like this. They told me Anna is disabled and may never experience a wedding of her own and while I have Michael for probably the rest of our lives she'll have no one and that Michael and I can be a little more understanding to the reality of her life. \n\nI feel like a total ass and what they're saying has really gotten to me and I'm starting to question my decision.  AITA?\n\nUpdate: My parents called me letting me know they won't be coming and that it's best I don't bring Michael around anymore since I've \"chosen some man over my sister\". They told me that Anna wanting to kiss Michael and hug him is normal for a women her age and that she doesn't understand what her feelings mean. I suggested they try to redirect her during the wedding but they said Michael is gonna be family to her and he needs to \"get over it\". I suggested they watch the wedding via web and they said that's not fair and that they deserve to see things in person. I asked if *I* could pay for someone with proper credentials to watch her that day while they attention and they asked what I would do when they died and if I'd pawn her off every time. I dropped the unfortunate truth bomb that I don't want to put any more of my life aside for Anna anymore. I did it up until I turned 18. And that Anna is not my life's responsibility and I won't be her keeper. I assured them I'd pay for her care but if she's okay doing this to Michael then I worry for if I ever do choose to have children and what she'd do to them \n They said I was sick for suggesting she'd do anything to my future children and hung up on me. They sent a lengthy text telling me not to contact them until I could \"do the right thing\".  So thts where we are right now.\n\nPLEASE READ: This is NOT an excuse to talk badly about disabled people's nor is this an opportunity to air out your hatred for them. My sister is not a scapegoat to hate disabled people. She is a human being with feelings, she is not a statistic, she is not evil. Please stop treating my sister as if she's a malicious monster, this debacle is between me and my parents. Leave her out of it, please. I am begging you, I don't want to hear why you think my sister sucks.",

It was a stressful time, and when my friend was over a few days before my surgery, we got on the topic of the \u201cboob-voyage\u201d party from Jane the virgin. I asked her if she would throw me one of those parties to help me get my mind off it. \n\nI thought she would put together just a small girls night, but she went all out. She invited all of my friends and my boyfriend and had an array of boob paraphernalia. It was funny and lighthearted and meant a lot to me to get all that support from my friends.\n\nDuring my recovery, my boyfriend confronted me and said that he hated the boob party, he thought it was tacky, and he was offended that I hadn\u2019t asked him to put something together instead. He said that we were supposed to be going through it together and I should have thought about his feelings and the fact that he doesn\u2019t like parties and wouldn\u2019t want to spend one of the nights leading up to my surgery like that. I told him that I\u2019m sorry he felt that way, but it was really helpful for me and I was the one getting surgery and treatment. I told him I wanted to support him but my feelings had to take priority under those particular circumstances and the party helped me. He\u2019s still angry at me for refusing to apologize for asking my friend to throw the party without asking how he felt about it first. It comes up now and again and he still wants me to apologize.

        "text": "My husband just got promoted to shift manager 3 weeks ago. This meant that his 10am-6pm shift has now been switched 4am to noon. He isnt a morning person AT ALL so most mornings he will start huffing and puffing as soon as his alarm goes off and he will instantly turn on our light and very loudly start looking for his work clothes.\n\nI have asked him several times to put clothes out the night before and he has yet to do so. I have also asked him to not turn the light on or be super loud. After all, when I worked at 5am I made sure to be respectful of him sleeping. \n\nSo yesterday morning when he got up at 3am and flipped on the light, I grabbed my stuff and went to the guest room. He came in and asked what I was doing. I told him that since he didnt respect me sleeping, at all, that I would be staying in the guest room from now on. He made a comment about \"The light will only be on for 5 freaking minutes.\" Which is not true. He turns the light on, finds himself clothes and then goes to take a shower without turning the light off. If I turn the light off, he will come back into the room after the shower and turn it on again to grab his socks and put on his shoes. (Which also pisses me off because shoes stay in the kitchen by the door and there's no reason he cant put them on at the table).\n\nAnyways, instead of understanding, he just got angry. Mainly because he is not a morning person and he doesnt like dealing with anything in the AM. So, while he was at work yesterday, I moved all my stuff into the guest room. Last night he practically begged me to sleep in the bedroom and promised to let me sleep. Well, this morning he flips on the fucking light again so I sit up and I'm like \"Are you kidding me right now?\" And he says \"I'm being quiet!\" As if that was the only issue. So I went into the guest room and locked the door. I told him I was staying in here from now on despite his efforts to sway me. He thinks I'm overreacting. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT FOR THE TROLLS OF REDDIT: I do in fact work. So your assumption that I dont is not only mislead but pretty ignorant. Also, the assumption that everything I have is due to my husband working, another ignorant statement. \n\nNot that it matters for the context of this post but I work 4pm to midnight. And cute little tid-bit, I'm the bread winner. I make nearly $5 more on my hourly wage. Take that info and shove it.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the awards and awesome feed back! I am in search of a (hopefully) light weight mask that one of you suggested. I hope it works!",

I will most likely not be continuing the week on/off arrangement at my dad's house this year.\n\nThe reason I initially got from my dad is that apparently I'm better at getting rides, while my step brother keeps bugging them for rides. And also because my stepbrother is there full time and I'm only there every other week.  I think that's totally bullshit. He knows how difficult it has been to get to my part time job. My stepbrother doesn't even have a job, like damn. And now the custody bs is my problem? I don't think so.\n\nI took the gift card and told my dad not to bother with getting me a car. I'm currently \"borrowing\" my grandmom's 2002 Corolla and I love it. And all I have to do in exchange is drive my grandmom around whenever she wants. It's awesome. We have a blast going around town.\n\nThere were a lot of different judgements on my initial post but at least I know I'm not completely crazy.\n\nPeople might think I'm being an entitled brat and that's fair. But I was legit so grateful for the gift card. I was freaking out. But I felt so stupid when I found out what my stepbrother got. It's not that I needed a car. I just wanted to be treated equally.\n\nThis is the first time ever I've been actually resentful about having my step brother in my life. Which I don't want to feel but it's the truth. They could've bought two cars for what they spent on my step brother's car. \n\nI don't hate my dad. But I realized that I can't really expect him to do right by me without me bitching about it. He's been sending money to my mother now since I'm here full-time. Some of that money is used to pay for my insurance. \n\nHe does text me a few times a week and I reply but I don't really have long conversations with him. I know he's sorry and he wants me around. But I just need some space from him. It kinda sucks realizing that a parent might not love you as much as you thought they did. But I'm sure our relationship will improve in time.\n\nI'm on track for college this year and I want to focus on school and put all this behind me. I'll be one of the few people from our family going to college so everyone is pretty excited.\n\nSo all in all, I think the outcome is pretty positive. \n\nThanks guys.",

Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. \n\nI love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. \n\nI said \u201cWell, the girls get to wear jeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThen, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear jeans. \n\nIn the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn\u2019t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn\u2019t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",

It\u2019s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with \u2018Jess\u2019 who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we\u2019ve met before and she\u2019s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick.

I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.\n\nShe was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my \u2018sister.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don\u2019t I know how much she\u2019s been through. She\u2019s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she\u2019s very brave - but I don\u2019t want to live with her.\n\nMy parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn\u2019t even here yet.\n\nWe live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don\u2019t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it\u2019s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don\u2019t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, \u2018We like this place and have no solid plan.\u2019 I freaked out and was like, \u2018You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you\u2019re changing everything I\u2019ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t want to have a sister.\u2019\n\nGood to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is \u2018too much effort.\u2019\n\nMy parents are offended that I\u2019m \u2018not being welcoming\u2019 towards my \u2018sister\u2019, and I\u2019m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I\u2019m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?\n\nUpdate: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.\n\njess also says hi to everyone - and thanks you for looking out for her.",

        "text": "It is the middle of the night, and my phone won't stop ringing because of my family.\n\nTo try and keep this short, my cousin \"Jake\" got outed about 4 or five days before his 18th birthday in the summer. His parents, my aunt and uncle, made arrangements for him to be sent to one of those awful camps that claim they could \"cure\" him. A kid in his community was forced to go and came back and was clearly not well, so Jake didn't want to go.\n\nJake ran away from home, and jumped from one family house to another. His folks didn't file a missing person report because they didn't want to look bad to their neighbors. They just told them that he went to that camp willingly.\n\nHe dissapeared in the middle of october, and turned up in my city a week later. After making sure he was safe to bring home, my wife and I allowed him to stay. He didn't want me to tell the rest of the family for a while, because those people at the camp keep showing up to take him.\n\nI made sure to talk to a lawyer, who assured Jake that they cannot take him. Three days ago, he told his parents he was here. A few hours later, those damn camp people showed up, but they were unable to take him.\n\nMy family has been blowing up my phone for the last two days angry that I didn't tell someone sooner. Well, jake didn't feel safe yet, and still doesn't. I wanted to make sure he was ready.\n\nStill, even those that want to protect Jake is upset with me for hiding him.\n\nAITA for not telling anyone that he is here until he was ready?\n\nEDIT:  Wow, thank you all for the awards. I don't deserve them but thanks. Since I am drinking coffee and slowly going through the comments I thought I should say a few things.\n\nFirst off, while I figured I wasn't the AH for hiding him from my more narrow minded family, it was those that really wanted to help jake that made me feel guilty. They were all scared out of their minds and wanted the peace to know he was ok. I felt bad for not telling them. Though i am sure they wouldn't had turned him in, I felt bad because we were working on keeping him safe.\n\nAlso,  we got a lawyer who got the police on the look out for those camp people in case they try anything. Jake is not going out alone until we are sure he is safe.\n\nThird, we are looking on how to get his paper work, like his birth certificate, here because no way he trusts his parents to just hand them over. My granny in law is talking to some people that could help.\n\nFourth, Jake says hello and thank you.\n\nOh and we're Catholic, not Christian. We're our own special type of jacka$$es.\n\nEDIT Once again: ok you're right about the Catholic/Christian thing. I was raised to split hairs, I apologize.",

        "text": "Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)\n\n   I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.\n\nShe's a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. \n\nIf you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.\n\n(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)\n\nThat's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.\n\nOur anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, \"I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again.\" We ended up going out instead.\n\nIt kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden \"because she likes the red sauce\" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.\n\nShe also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.\n\nI just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.\n\nTL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?\n\nEdit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.\n\nEdit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick\n\nEdit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?\n\nAlso, yes, I wash the dishes\n\n#Final Edit:\n\nOkay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess.\n\nI really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.\n\nSo her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.\n\nShe said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. \n\nI'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.\n\nSo, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.\n\n",

It was a stressful day doing a deeper search in my house trying to think like my nephew and looking in places where I think he\u2019d hide something if he really didn\u2019t want it to be found. And the decision was if it really wasn\u2019t found and my brother wasn\u2019t able to get him to talk, or they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay back what I\u2019m owed then the police would get involved. He did beg me not to but I told him then you better pray I find it or you come up with the money to pay me for it. \n\nGuess both our prayers worked because guess where I found it? In the freaking sink. The SINK. And that\u2019s thanks to the comments who told me to look in those places. Idk what I would\u2019ve done otherwise. It was the sink that was in their guest room, I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t just throw it away. \n\nYou guys don\u2019t know how freaking relieved I was to find it. Took some work to remove the p trap under the sink to get it out but I was just so happy to find it!! Same night my girlfriend (fianc\u00e9e \ud83d\ude09) got back I proposed to her and she said yes!! After a nice romantic dinner just the two of us at home\u2026\nThe plan was to wait but after all this shit I thought fuck it I\u2019m proposing ASAP before anything else happens \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\n\nAfter my brother heard about me finding the ring he thought this meant they could come back. I said no. He wanted to argue about this again. All I told him was he\u2019s lucky I haven\u2019t gone to the cops since there was already video evidence of his son taking the ring and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting them back in when my nephew wouldn\u2019t even say what he did with the ring. I talked with my nephew myself after I found the ring but he just said he didn\u2019t want to tell anyone because then I\u2019d be mad at him for hiding it. Honestly I just don\u2019t have the energy for them anymore, his problem is their problem and hopefully they get him help before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOnly thing important to me is my fianc\u00e9e and I starting our lives and planning our wedding \ud83d\ude01 Thank you Reddit for your help!! Seriously you guys were my life savers \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit to add: I just received this news after already submitting my post for approval and just wanted to add because I\u2019m so happy, but girlfriend also informed me she\u2019s pregnant!!! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 She found out while she was on her trip and was waiting for a good time to tell me. Not related to the post but idc, I\u2019m gonna be a dad !!!!",

        "text": "So I'm the owner of a wonderful rescued macaw. She is a wonderful bird but has a lot of issues due to an abusive former home. I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds.\n\nI met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. \n\nShe caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and \"bond\" all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years.\n\nEdit 2: Beginning to think it was maybe a mistake posting this. Mostly because this is a real and nuanced situation and reddit is no place for nuance, and maybe personal relationships shouldn't be judged in the AH context in the first place. But also because I should be more understanding and a bigger person regardless of who is or isn't the asshole. Life is too short to be butthurt and offended.\n\nI called my stepdaughter and told her that I understand this is a big moment in her life and she wants someone there to help and support her, and that I'm still willing to help her in any way I can to plan the wedding via zoom and virtually. We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, \"fake\" replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do. I'll leave this post up but I'm happy either way and I'm glad the feedback here motivated me to make the call.",

        "text": "Heya. \n\nSo this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. \n\nI take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background: \n\n I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). \n\nIve had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. \n\nNow onto the story: \n\nI'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. \n\nI look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. \n\nThe man was stuttering and saying things like \"I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says \"seizure alert dog\").\" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes \"my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog\" \n\nI told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. \n\nI was then at my stop and ran home.\n\nI felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. \n\nShould I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?\n\nEdit to clear up some things: \n\n-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation\n-I'm a female :) \n-I live in Canada\n-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse \n-If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.\n\n\n\nEdit: I didnt know about the dog tax! Attached: [The headshot my work took for our HR Directory! ](https://imgur.com/a/Xm2lRpc)",

We moved into a smaller apartment, had to sell many things and give up most of our \"costly\" habits.\n\nMy husband has an expensive habit of going to the spa for a weekly massage session. we live in an urban area so this stuff is ridiculously expensive. A single session is 250$, and he has to have it every week so that'd be nearly 1000 a month!. I offered him to have his session at a regular spa but no, he has to get it from that luxurious spa near the restaurant we used to go saying the lady who gives the massage is an expert and he's used to her.\n\nProblem is I'm the only income earner and I'm struggling to make ends meet. I'm also pregnant and need to save money to prepare a nursery. I told him to cut his sessions but he refused. I told him I won't be paying for them anymore and he said he'd get the money himself.\n\nYesterday I checked and saw that he's been using my credit card for his sessions for a whole month and had maxed out completely. I found that out when I went shopping for baby essentials and the cashier said I had no money. I had to return everything then went home and went off on him. I told him he maxed my card out and made me look like an idiot at the store, he said he didn't tell me cause he knew I'd have an issue with it. I demanded he pay back the $1000 he spent but he refused, I yelled at him calling him irresponsible and he got upset and called me selfish and told me to stop playing victim and that this is affecting both of us since he's going to be a parent too and it's stressful for him and I keep dismissing his own needs as a human.\n\nI went upstairs and he went out. He started giving me silent but I kept demanding the money back. he said I shouldn't expect it back since we're married then my money is technically his and I should stop using his unemployement against him.",

I\u2019m not comfortable posting photos on a public forum, especially with some creeps and assholes on here.\n\nWow I\u2019m an idiot I should absolutely update what happened at the wedding sorry I got that mommy brain\n\nShe still wanted everyone to wear black, but she did go lax on style. So like, kind of a redemption arc? The photos look nice, if not a little dreary. She thought black would make things look classy. She looked beautiful tho so mission accomplished.",

My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I\u2019ve never cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. \n\n\nDinner was going alright until Amy\u2019s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entr\u00e9e. After that, Amy, who isn\u2019t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn\u2019t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. \n\n\nI loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary. Amy isn\u2019t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and Amy\u2019s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy\u2019s boyfriend to get up and leave with her. Don\u2019t worry, you pay before you get your food at this restaurant. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I talked about Amy. She kept saying that Amy and some of her friends make those comments all the time and they don\u2019t mean them to be derogatory. I tried to convince my girlfriend that no friend would make those types of comments and she\u2019s better off without someone like Amy in her life. \n\n\nMy girlfriend still thinks that Amy didn\u2019t mean to hurt her with the \u201creal woman\u201d and \u201cBarbie doll\u201d comments and I didn\u2019t read the room correctly. She told me she feared Amy not wanting to be friends with her anymore after my creating a rift between them. I couldn\u2019t get though to her no matter how much I tried.",

She asked me within 5 minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time. I said no, sorry I need it more (bad feet/knees) and went back to my things. She asked me again within 2 minutes and the answer was the same. She however got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me. He asked me himself (politely) and I again responded that sorry but I need it more and suggested she could wait in their car or just sit in the ground. At this point the husband directly called me an asshole but left me alone\n\nAita",

As a result we are very close and she\u2019s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they\u2019ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first \u2018boyfriend\u2019. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it\u2019s just the mum inside me but I couldn\u2019t be happier for her. \n\nI went to my older sisters house for coffee earlier this morning. Backstory, my sister has two teenagers (16 and 17), who live almost full time with their dad. They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won\u2019t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don\u2019t want to live with her. \n\nMy daughter came up in conversation and so bought up her first date. When I explained how it went, my sister laughed and told me that I must be joking. When she realised I was serious, she told me I was a terrible mother for letting my daughter walk all over me and not setting boundaries. She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said \u2018I would never allow my kids to do that,\u2019 so I replied by saying \u2018That\u2019s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.\u2019 She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I\u2019m wondering if I crossed the line.",

A lot has happened the past few weeks so I thought I would share.\n\nNot long after I posted, Amy came to me to apologize. I was surprised because based on the responses I was getting, I was preparing to apologize to her. She said she lashed out because she was trying to reconcile her relationship as she knew it with the new information about who he was. I asked her if she really had no idea and she said that, looking back, there were warning signs but nothing that would lead her to believe that he was overtly racist. I guess being long distance and liking him so much allowed her to remain mostly ignorant. She wanted to know what she should do. I told her that I was going to talk to Dan and try to get a beat on who HE is apart from his parents. She seemed to think that was a good idea.\n\nA lot of people said that I was being unfair labeling him a racist before, but now that we have spoken I can tell you for certain that he is a racist. A lot of you were trying to figure out what Amy meant by him not being \"wholly\" racist and I think I can answer that now. He told me that he doesn't harbor any hatred for anyone, but he believes the white race will go extinct eventually and he is proud of who he is and of his race and he doesn't want that to happen. Which I guess also explains his fathers comment about white grandbabies. I told him that his heritage is nothing to be proud of and that his beliefs will have no place in our family or in my household. He said that Amy seemed to understand him and that I might not have a choice of whether or not his beliefs will be a part of my family. I said that he was right, if Amy wants to move forward with the wedding then there is nothing I can do to stop her. He sneered and told me that he supposed we had nothing more to discuss and that was the end of it.\n\nI told Amy what me and him discussed and she decided to call it all off. She broke up with him and he has not taken too kindly to it. He has been to the house a lot so we decided to get her an apartment back in the city. Her work is going to start phasing back into the office anyway so the timing works out. His parents called us and came to speak with us a few times. At first they were just trying to figure out what was going on but it quickly turned into them berating us. I got some reddit flak for not standing up to them initially so this time I made sure they knew where I stood.",

I was so confused I asked what he was doing and he said that he was trying to get one of the waiter staff's attention. I said it was embarrassing and he should stop right then but he kept shaking it. I can not begin to explain the looks we received from everyone.\n\nI demanded him to stop but he said not til someone came and took our order. I threatened to leave the place and cancel dinner if he wouldn't and he kept doing it. Someone came already, but I'd already gotten up, took my purse and started making my way out. He followed me and started arguing about walking out but I told him that I couldn't take being embarrassed by him and he got upset and said that he didn't get why I thought the bell was embarrassing, explained that it was a perfect solution for no longer be forced to wait til someone shows up. I asked if it was acceptable to do this in america and he said \"yes because it's a free country and people there usually don't give a shit\" but I said it's inappropriate and embarrasding here. he said I was being too sensitive and overreacted over nothing. He insisted we go back inside but I refused.\n\n\n\nWe ended up leaving, he kept on about how I ruined dinner by cancelling it and offending him by acting like his behavior is shamful. I said I had a right to give an opinion on what he's done even if he thought what he was doing  but he basically told me to get off my high horse and stop calling his \"genius\" idea embarrassing.\n\n\nHe's been sulking for days now and wanting an apology, Maybe I overreacted. maybe it's nothing where he lives but here it's just unacceptable.",

The school has a dress code for hair that just specified \u201cnatural hair colors only\u201d. Which I took to mean browns, blondes, reds, black etc basically natural tones. Her natural hair is black but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a change. The hairdresser that did a bleaching on her hair said it was not lighten enough to cause significant damage. \n\nBut then one of the teachers in the beginning of the oct last year began complaining to me during parent teacher meetings that her hair didn\u2019t meet dress code. I said her hair color grew out of people\u2019s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter\u2019s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it\u2019s pretty racist to say she can\u2019t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks \u201cnatural\u201d. \n\nThis went on until the end of the school year. I contacted the superintendent several times but she never got back to me. It\u2019s almost the start of school again and I get an email from the principle reminding me my daughter is only allowed black hair. She still has her reddish brown hair and doesn\u2019t want to dye it back. But I\u2019ve tried to fight it and the last thing to do is to barge into the superintendents office and demand she get involved.",

I pay my boyfriend half of the market rate rent, which we update every year by looking how much the flats are being rented out for in the building complex. Which is a lot of money, but I agreed to it. Other than this, we did everything else 50-50 in the past.\n\nI got a new job with a significant pay increase and now my boyfriend says we should start splitting expenses proportional to income, because that's fair. \n\nI told him I don't think it's fair that I should start paying for more, just because I got a new job and nothing else changed. I already pay him rent - enough rent that would get me a same-sized flat a few streets away - so it's more than fair to him.\n\nHe made some -in my opinion very weak- arguments and accused me of ripping him off. That's when I told him that under no circumstances we will split expenses proportional to income.\n\nNow that I've calmed down a bit, I'm worried whether I'm in the wrong. Especially since my best friend told me that this is how they do it with her boyfriend too and my boyfriend owning the flat is irrelevant here. AITA?",

It had been Poppy's birthday last week and we hadn't been able to visit them to wish her, so we gave her the gifts we had bought for her. \n\n\n\nMy parents bought her a doll house and some clothes and I bought her a remote controlled car and some toy binoculars. Aunt Lola and Poppy was very happy and accepted the gifts but my uncle looked annoyed when he saw what I'd bought for Poppy.\n\n\nI asked him if something was wrong and he asked me why I bought \"boys toys\" for his daughter when she was a girl. I asked him if he is saying only boys can play with remote controlled cars and binoculars and he said yes. He asked me why I didn't buy her a doll or a kitchen set or something more feminine. I stared at him incredulously and told him that anyone can play with these and toys aren't gendered, but he kept insisting they are and started to get angry.\n\n\nMy mom told me to let it go but I found it ridiculous that he was already restricting his daughter's choices at such a young age and forcing her to be \"feminine\".\nUncle Jesse then said \"If I had had a son, then these gifts would be acceptable. Unfortunately it is Lola's fault that she gave me a daughter, so don't give Poppy such masculine gifts.\"\n\n\nI knew my uncle wasn't very educated but this was the dumbest thing I had ever heard someone say. I informed him that it was his sperm that decided Poppy would be a girl, it isn't Lola's fault at all. That Lola has XX chromosomes and he had XY chromosomes and I basically went on a rant explaining how everything works. He was extremely angry after this and told me to stop lying and to shut up. He picked up Poppy and told Lola that they're leaving, they took only the gifts my parents brought and asked my parents to \"teach this idiot manners\". My dad yelled at him for saying this and my mom didn't say much to them but told me I had stepped out of line. That I should have just stayed silent and ignored what he had said. She said I was extremely rude. \n\nAITA?",

She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.\n\nIt's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is \"ridiculous\", and she needs to \"get some therapy\" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.\n\nShe was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. \n\nJust to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold.",

It's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.\n\nIt seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to \"get out\" is actually incredibly scary to me.\n\nThis isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.\n\nI *am* the asshole, I already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. Sorry, teenagers, but I kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. I wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but I would also be looking at their advice differently if I knew their lack of life experience. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust be careful everyone. And please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. This doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind \"sub dedicated to helping others\" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than \"sub dedicated to calling other people assholes.\" I just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",

She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.\n\nI didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there.

This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: \"She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled.\" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.\n\nEdit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report.",

        "text": "This is an update to my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ixsv9j/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_a_paternity_test_unless/).\n\nThanks to everyone who commented on my original post. Unfortunately, this is not a great update. If you don\u2019t want to read it all, the bottom line is we\u2019re heading toward divorce.\n\nI took some of the commenters\u2019 advice to go to couples therapy, which we did that same week as my first post. I had to push him a bit to get him to agree to the therapy but I told him it was either this or I would never give in to the test.\n\nThe first zoom session was a little awkward since neither of us had ever done therapy before. After listening to both of us, she basically said that she thought we should do the test to see if that eases his anxiety, and that if it doesn\u2019t (which, at the time. was my concern) that we could go from there. So my husband was thrilled and I agreed but I wanted to be on Zoom with the therapist when we received the results so we could talk it out with her there, which he was fine with.\n\nSo we do the test and we did our Zoom session when our results were in. And surprise, surprise, the paternity test says he\u2019s 99% likely to be the father.\n\nHe didn\u2019t appear relieved or happy or anything of what I expected. Maybe this was unfair but I did expect him to cry and maybe apologize to me for his lack of trust. This wasn't just my imagination though because when the therapist asked him in our first session how he would feel if the test came back saying he was the father, he said he would feel relieved. But he was angry. He kept saying that it was over and that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He kept repeating \u201cits done\u201d over and over when the therapist would try to ask a question about how he was feeling and he was obviously not listening when I tried to talk about my feelings. And when I told him I wanted to talk about it, he yelled at me (which he NEVER does) \u201cWhat else is there to fucking talk about?\u201d I was mortified that he was talking to me this way in front of a therapist and she said we should schedule a new session once he \u201chad time to process.\u201d\n\nAfter the session, he wouldn\u2019t look at me or speak to me. That he was so upset that he WAS our wonderful son\u2019s father made me absolutely lose my mind. We screamed at each other and it ended with me saying that I can\u2019t do this anymore. He\u2019s at his brother\u2019s apartment now (finally away from our son, which is obviously what he wanted all along) and my mom is now staying at my place go help me out around the house. I texted him this weekend asking if he wanted to do another therapy session and he asked if I really thought that would help and I had to admit that I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe speed at which this whole thing happened (just a month ago, I would have said we have a happy marriage!) is still completely shocking to me. But I don\u2019t see us recovering from this. This felt cathartic to type out though so thanks I guess.",

Later I asked him if he'd be willing to read the thread and he agreed. He was very subdued afterwards, and didn't say much except for agreeing that he was an AH. The next day he took off work and saw his GP, started on anti-depressants, and we had a long talk.\n\nHe was ashamed by how he was acting and to see strangers comparing him to children. He cried when realised how much he was letting everyone down, especially his daughters who will grow up thinking this is normal behaviour.\n\nHe confirmed that this all started when we lived with his parents a few years back. He left home at 17 to get away from his mother, and she told him he'd fail as men need a woman to look after them. He felt like a failure so it was easy for his mother to feed him other ideas, and she would also manipulate things I did to look like he was incompetent as a person (eg. I'd tell him to relax and I'd handle the dishes, and his mother twisted it into me thinking he was incompetent) so he should just stop helping at all. He'd wake up feeling useless, and she managed to convince him that he was unhappy because I wasn't taking care of him the way a wife should.\n\nHe decided to got no contact with her which didn't go well. She cried and told him he was a horrible son for abandoning his mother, and that I was trying to control him by 'forcing' him to do it. He blocked her but she'd just use different numbers to continue calling him. After a week or so he ended up changing his number, and we haven't heard from his family since.\n\nHe bought up that he was unhappy at work as it wasn't stimulating enough, but he felt like he couldn't leave. I offered to pick up some part time work but he said no. He talked to his boss and took some time off, and eventually quit.\n\nHe spoke to my dad who used some connections and got him a good job at his company. The new job is a primarily work from home position, so he is able to help with the girls more and has more free time. He is able to take the girls to school and watch them play while he works which they all enjoy.\n\nBefore he started the new job he booked a trip for us to go to the snow for a week. We had a blast and it was lovely to see him relaxed and happy and enjoying our girls and life. He's promised to be more honest about how he's feeling and our relationship has improved immensely.\n\nThank you for everyone who gave judgement and advise, as he says it really helped him see things more clearly, especially the toxic relationship with his mother.",

She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.\n\n\nIn order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. \n\n\nMy wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider.

She\u2019s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we\u2019ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she\u2019d like me to keep at the house as she\u2019s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer\u2019s for me and my husband, and didn\u2019t think anything of it. \nA little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn\u2019t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. \nShe was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer\u2019s. I told her to leave and she walked home. \nShe messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer\u2019s were alcohol, and she hadn\u2019t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn\u2019t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn\u2019t my fault she got drunk. \nMy husband says I\u2019m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn\u2019t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go. \nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: okay guys, I\u2019m the asshole. I see it now. Thank you. I\u2019ll hire her again.\n\nEdit #2: I will pay her $1500 a week from now on.

She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  \n\nShe has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  \n\nMy parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  \n\nWell my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. \n\nI have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  \n\nMy sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. \n\nWhen I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  \n\nAfter talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. \n\nSo rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  \n\nI just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nHey. I just got home from school.  There is a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  And my mom gave me a key.  She says that she is keeping the other one for emergency.  I agreed as long as it was only for emergencies.",

I don't have the best relationship with my MIL as she always seem to police what I eat.\n\nEveryone in my family have fast metabolism, I am also working with horses so due to this burn a lot of calories (talking about 2.5-3k a day) and usually have rather large meals to get the energy back and I still remain skinny.\n\nNow to the event. My in-laws invited me and Nate for dinner last Friday. I was very busy back then and haven't eaten since about 6-7am and also didn't have a chance to have a snack before heading to the restaurant so I was starving (I usually have something to eat before seeing my MIL to avoid her comments). Due to this I have ordered a large steak at the restaurant which was meant for 2 people, it also came with prawns, bacon and 2 sides. Please note it was not the most expensive item on the menu as some of my in laws had significantly pricier dishes and we were all splitting the bill anyway.\n\nMy MIL started making comments how I shouldn't be ordering what I can't eat since even her husband wouldn't be able to finish the dish, let alone someone my size. I smiled and said I haven't eaten since early morning and am starving, if I don't finish the steak I will take the leftovers home.\n\nI have easily finished the steak and was waiting for my dessert, when my MIL flipped. She said I am attention seeking and was putting on a show, she also said I have made my FIL and BIL feel uneasy and that a woman shouldn't eat that much, it is unhealthy and something is wrong with me. She has then demanded me and Nate to cover the entire bill as she wasn't planning on \"such a big expenditure\". I said we are absolutely not covering the entire bill since it was meant to be split equally and reminded her of the dishes she ordered, that were significantly more expensive compared to my steak (including her starter). As a result I was called an asshole who has ruined a family dinner.\n\nNate is on my side but most of my in-laws are making very passive aggressive posts on social media about it and keep sending me different articles of \"what might cause excessive eating\".",

        "text": "I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.\n\nMy birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.\n\nTwo days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to \"that kind\" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.\n\nIt didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.\n\nOnly my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. \n\nNow the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal.",

        "text": "My M27 fianc\u00e8e F25 has an obvious permanent burnscar from an accident that caused her mother (her only parent) to pass away from injury. My fianc\u00e8e had a long recovery it's been 7 years. The scar is on her collarbone. it goes down her chest but isn't showing. Unless she's wearing scoop/square tops. She often wears hoodies/jackets to cover up. She puts this cream I don't know what ladies call it but it's supposed to tone skin color or something? I'm not sure but my fianc\u00e8e calls it foundation that is one degree brighter than her skin color. I absolutely adore her she's pretty, smart, ambitious and the list goes on. What happened was unfortunate and I'm glad she's at peace with herself and more confident.\n\nMy family love her. How can they not. She's a member of the family. My mom makes sure she takes part in every family function and things like shopping and decorating other things. However. My sister made comments about my fianc\u00e8e's scar several times. I've called her out on her behavior several times to get her to stop because she was hurting me before my fianc\u00e8e with her backhanded and insensitive\ncomments. I told my fianc\u00e8e she had everyright to cut my sister out and not deal with her bullshit but she has been forgiving and respectful of my entire family.\n\nOur wedding is in February. My fianc\u00e8e went shopping for the wedding dress. This is where the issue started:\n\nMy fianc\u00e8e showed the wedding dress to my sister. I didn't see it but I was told it was a spaghetti strap dress. My fianc\u00e8e likes this stuff. Anyways my sister saw it and went nuts she started criticising her choice and said that she should've gotten a high nick or a jewel wedding dress to cover up the scar. She argued with my fianc\u00e8e about it. I went to my family's house and I confronted her. I yelled at her after she told me my fiancee needed to return the dress and get a \"proper\" one so that guests won't focus on her burnscar and use it as the topic of conversation and gossip. I told her that she's not invited to our wedding. She isn't welcome to my wedding with this entitled attitude of hers and her insensitivity and disrespect. We argued for half an hour then I left.\n\nIn exactly an hour. My mom and dad called and berated me saying my sister was crying after I uninvited her and that I had no right to univinte her. She's my sister and was just trying to help out and give an advice and avoid any \"unnecessary\" drama at the wedding. My mom said my fianc\u00e8e can keep the dress but suggested to wear a pridel shawl as a neutral solution. I stopped responding to my mom's calls and texts after that. Family members were upset my sister was uninvited and wanted me to invite her again because this will make family look bad in front of outsiders and guests.",

        "text": "I(43F) have been with my partner(50M) for 6 years now. We have been living together for 5 of them. We are not married and we do not plan to marry in the future.\n\nI have a son(19M) that is currently a highschool senior. My partner has a daughter(21F) who is going to college.\n\nThe background you need to understand the issue: when I met my partner I was a widow of 3 years. I am lucky enough to have a very lucrative business and some family money. Also my late husband left a substantial estate, including the house we live in. The house is a family home so it passed to my son as the only heir.\nMy partner also makes good money and the difference in our lifestyles was pretty much negligible.\n\nBut while I and my late husband made sure to not spoil our son (he was responsible for keeping his room clean even though we have a house keeper, he had chores during the weekends, we taught him how to cook, his allowance is reasonable, he has to save for expensive purchases like a car, a PS5...etc). My current partner and his ex-wife spoil their daughter rotten.\n\nDue to an incident when we first moved in together (she demanded my son's bedroom since it was the second biggest, got rejected since it was his home and she only spends the weekend), and after some family therapy we agreed that she will be treated like a guest by me. She will have to follow the house rules and that it the extent of our relationship.\n\nNow while she is spoiled she is a good girl, academically excellent, except for the aforementioned incident very respectful and just a pleasant young woman.\n\nThe probelm is that I did not know the extent to which my partner spent money on her. He pays some money as \"rent\" that I put into my son's college fund and we split the common bills in half. Everything else is our own responsibility so we don't know much about each other's finances.\n\nNow my son is planning to do a tour of east Asia during the summer and I was happy to give him the money to do so (as a gift for getting into a very prestigious college). When my stepdaughter heard about it she asked her dad to pay for a tour of Europe since he didn't send her on one after she got into college.\n\nHe agreed because he never says no, but he came to me asking me to lend him close to $30k because he can't afford the trip on his own. I am not even giving that much to my son and his plane tickets are more expensive.\n\nI refused. I said that since this wasn't an emergency he can save and send her on the trip after she graduates college. Now he is not talking to me, saying that I am chosing favourites (I have no relationship with his daughter so I don't know how that even is applicable) and that I am putting money over his happiness and relationship with his daughter.\n\nSo AITA? I can easily afford to lend him the full amount I just don't want to, because his reasons are not convincing enough.",

And it is way more soap opera than I thought.\n\n1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers\n\n2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way\n\n3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.\n\n4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.\n\n5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.\n\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nA while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.\n\nThe wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.\n\nWell, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says \"I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!\"\n\nI thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.\n\nThe first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.\n\nFinally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like \"you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about\" and he said it was \"the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital\" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said \"you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.\"\n\nThe confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.\n\nHe got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said \"maybe it's because I have different insurance\" because that's all I could think of.\n\nWell he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. \n\nEveryone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?",

It took a while, but I agree with it. Some develops have happened since then so I thought I would update:- \n\n1) I admitted to my wife I was being an asshole and was ready to learn welsh. I've been using duolingo and sitting down with my daughter and wife while we do my daughter's homework. My wife still laughs whenever I say Llanelli, but here we are.\n\n2) I showed my wife the AITA post. She said I was a complete dipshit, but she cried and admitted she has been excluding me on purpose in the hopes that I would learn Welsh if she did it enough. I explained how it made me more resentful and I had almost left her because of it. We're going to go to couple's therapy. \n\n3) She told me that I need to tell yanks who pretended they could say \"Llanfair PG\" to \"cachau bant\" and \"cau dy ceg\". They were some of the first words I learned in Welsh so they can be yours too :) \n\n4) I sent my dad a message telling him to ask my mother if she can start pronouncing Megan the way my wife wants it. Megan likes it the Welsh way too and faux-vomited when I asked her if she liked the way Nana said it. My mother hasn't said anything, but my wife and I taught Megan to tell her \"Nana, I like my name said like this\" when my mum says it wrong. We'll have to see where this goes, since my mum has said in the past that she won't pronounce it like a \"sheep-sh*gging pleb\". I will be putting my foot down if she starts. \n\n5) There was someone who pretended to be my wife on another post. I reported it and it got taken down. I did not make my wife sleep on the couch that night lol. Just some sad person creating made-up drama.\n\n6) My daughter and I managed to get a 5-star island on Animal Crossing. Not relevant, but we managed it this week! Have a nice day and cheers for your help.\n\nEDIT: For everyone who keeps asking about pronouncing Megan in a Southern Welsh dialect [this guy explains](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/irwg3q/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_child_speak_her/g543lr3/) the difference. If you want to hear how it's said then I suggest the first lesson in Duolingo!",

        "text": "I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.\n\n\nIn the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.\n\n\nI commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.\n\n\nHe got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like \"That's cute.\" I just let it go.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. \n\n\nAt first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. \"Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl.\" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. \n\n\nSo, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.\n\n\nMy friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.\n\n\nWhen we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. \n\n\nI started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?\n\n\nUpdate: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong.",

But started...sort of living the experience of having a child by doing the things that parents do like getting a nursery (they removed it now) buying bany cothes, toys, attending school shows etc etc.\n\n\nI'm 7 months pregnant, and BIL & SIL has been asking many questions on what's it like to be expecting. It was bothersome with them getting involved but I grin & bear til they requested to be with me in the delivery room to experience child birth. I said no and stood firm but later discovered that my husband \"volunteered\" his place to give his brother and his wife both a chance to have this experience. We had a fight and I told him off.\n\nBIL & SIL came over later to try to \"talk me\" into it, I nicely said no but they pushed me so I blew up telling them their fertility problems aren't my fault (harsh I know and regret saying it) and told them to get therapy. Sil started crying, Bil asked me take time to think but I rudely said there was nothing to think about and my mind's already been made. \n\n\nThey left and my husband starte raging, after yelling at me about how this is his child too and how rude and dismissive I was to his grieving and strugglig brother and wife, he told me to look him in the eyes and tell him if I would be happy to ruin his brother's marriage when I can do this small, yet graceful deed and help BIL and wife \"process\" their trauma and finally make peace with it. I felt so much anger I cried, he told me to get over myself already and stop being purposefully selfish and petty.\n\nWe're not talking now and he says it stays this way til I say yes, I might've acted cruel but I just wanted him as the father of my child to be with me and don't feel comfortable with BIL & SIL being there.",

        "text": "Sorry for the wordy title, my (18M) dad left my mom when I was 6 (not because of my step-mom), four years ago he met and married my SM Aida, she had 3 kids from a previous marriage that my dad loved to parent instead of me, after they got together I saw him, at best, 7-8 times every year because they moved 5 hour away. A year later he had ''a change of heart'' and demanded his 50/50 custody, which made me miserable, he built a room for me at his new house, tried to fill the missing years with new gifts, even planned a big birthday party for my 12th birthday, at 13, I stopped going to his place. \n\nFor me, he wasn't my dad. After he left, mom's brother (who was only 25 at the time) took me in as one of his boys, mom and I moved back to  my grandparents place and my uncle lived next door, he already had a kid, and he was always there for me, he's my father while my aunt is like a second mother for me and my cousin is like the brother I never had. When I stopped going to my bio-dad's my mom had to get a second job so I used to sleep at my uncle's pretty much every day, I didn't understand why until last year, when my grandma told me my dad had stopped paying child support out of spite and my mom didn't had the money to take him to court. \n\nEver since I turned 15, father's day is about my uncle for me, my cousin and I make him breakfast and plan a fun day with him with a small gift, now that I'm 18, my step-mom sent me a fb message saying that I'm old enough to give my part for my bio-dad's gift, this year, his step-kids wants to give him a car and that I should put 10% (like 1,800 to 2,100). I just sent her a lol meme and said she could use my missing child support to cover it. She blocked me and later on one of her kids sent me an AH message. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! \nI\u2019m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced \u201cAcadian/Chiac\u201d accent. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I\u2019m perfectly bilingual in both languages.\n\nI started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they\u2019ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn\u2019t want to be rude to his family but it\u2019s getting super weird. I don\u2019t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I\u2019m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said \u201ca la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cto the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth\u201d when she meant \u201cthis pumpkin pie tastes delicious\u201d) \nShe constantly criticizes my \u201caccent\u201d.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to \u201cpick a language\u201d when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper \u201cfran\u00e7ais standard\u201d is actually getting harder for me since I\u2019ve been only studying/working in English). \n\nSo last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn\u2019t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  \nTurns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might\u2019ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it\u2019s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn\u2019t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",

        "text": "I(28F) am a mother of a wonderful 8 years old son. This whole thing happened last April, but I am still getting complaints. So here I am asking strangers for a judgement on the internet.\n\nSo last year was my kid's first year in \"big kids' school\" like he calls it, since his first grade coincided with the pandemic. We are not in the best place financially; like most families, our consumer debt piled on and we are throwing every spare cent at it.\n\nSo when it was time to throw him a party, I only invited 5 of his classmates, the ones he considered his friends. For the others I sent 2 dozen cupcakes and juice boxes to class.\n\nThe invites were delivered to their houses and not in front of the other kids.\n\nLike I said, money was tight so I got creative. I made 9 small cakes (box cakes, vanilla, chocolate and funfetti), buttercream in different colours. Also made big sugar cookies and different coloured frosting and sprinkles. And finally bought tortillas, made pizza sauce and had a variety of toppings. I asked that the kids bring swimsuits and water guns.\n\nWe had a make your own pizza station for lunch, then they played with their water guns. Then they decorated their cakes and finally their cookies to take home with them. That was a Saturday.\n\nWell the next Monday, the kids would not stop raving about how fun the party was, how it was the best birthday party ever. The other kids were not happy to not be invited.\n\nAt pick up Tuesday, a couple moms confronted me about not inviting their kids. I said that I am sorry, but it was a small party for his close friends only. They kept complaining about me excluding their kids.\n\nI didn't take it seriously then, but now it is a new school year, almost 6 month later, and I am still getting the occasional comment thrown at me.

        "text": "Yes, I know the title sounds awful, but please do hear me out before making a judgement. I will accept whatever judgement I\u2019m given.\n\nI (30m) purchased a 3 bedroom condo in Toronto, Canada 5 years ago when I was in my second year of medical residency. Soon after the purchase, I rented one of the rooms to my roommate (f29) to offset the costs of the mortgage. I live in one room, she lives in the second, and the third is my study/office. She has been a great roommate from the beginning. We aren\u2019t necessarily friends (as in we don\u2019t do things together for fun), but we get along exceptionally well.\n\nThe entire roommate/tenant relationship has gone swimmingly up until recently. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate broke the news to me that she is pregnant. The father was a fling of hers, who does not want anything to do with the child. My roommate has decided she wants to keep the child anyways, and raise it on her own. To me that seems like a huge challenge, and I admire her for it.\n\nThe issue is, while I don\u2019t necessarily dislike children, I have no desire to live with a baby. While the condo is a fair size, I will most definitely be woken up by the babies crying at night. My condo is also where I like to come home to and relax, like a haven after a long work day, and the idea of coming home to a baby honestly seems absolutely chaotic. Especially since this isn\u2019t my own child (ie one that my girlfriend and I decided to have/was mentally prepared for).\n\nAs difficult as it was for me to do this, I told my her essentially what I\u2019ve written here, and that it would be best if she finds somewhere else to live. I am not rushing her out or anything like that, I have given her 6 month\u2019s notice, since any later than that will come too close to the birth. She was honestly quite taken aback by this, and thought that I was being cruel. Her primary concern is that rent has gone up substantially in this city since she signed on with me (I haven\u2019t increased her rent since she moved in, so she\u2019s essentially paying 2015 rent). She works as a waitress, and will likely need to find a lesser apartment to keep within the same budget. A couple of other considerations are that she was out of work while restaurants were closed, but I did waive her rent for that period. All of the furniture is also mine (aside from her bedroom), so she would need to figure something out on that front as well, aside from all of the child expenses. I understand her position, and I feel horrible about the situation, but I honestly can\u2019t do it. AITA for this?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. There have been two great suggestions on how I can make this situation better, which I have taken to heart. I haven't been able to give life much thought lately, as work has been quite busy. Firstly, I have a friend in real estate, and I'm going to see if they can help her try to find some affordable listings. Secondly - as I don't plan to take on another tenant after her, and can afford to do this anyway - I have decided I'm going to waive her rent for the remainder of the tenancy. This will hopefully give her a bit of a boost to get on her feet.\n\nEdit 2: I'm just checking on this for the first time today. My god, I was not expecting anywhere near this many replies. Thank you to everyone who has commented. I am about to head into surgery, but I will do my best to get back to as many people as I can later today.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit 3/update:  I am honestly overwhelmed by the amount of attention this has gotten. Thank you everyone that commented, regardless of your opinion. I was planning to reply to as many posts as possible, but honestly seeing as there are over 2000 comments, I think I will have to just address some common questions here. I also have an update on the situation, and I wish everyone that's commented so far could receive notification to read it.\n\nSo firstly: To anyone asking about the legality of the matter, I consulted an attorney to be 1000% sure, and this is perfectly legal. Since I live in the unit, the eviction laws are much more lenient.\n\nSecondly: To anyone that said I should allow her to live with me anyway, I challenge you to consider what the alternative would be. If this doesn't happen now, then when? Her baby will become a toddler, and a toddler eventually becomes a school age child. Will it really be any better to do this later on? Or do you suggest that I let her raise the child here until they are 18?\n\n**Finally, the update:** When I came home from work today, I told her that I wanted to discuss the overall situation. Before I even began, she actually apologized to me for how she spoke to me, and for expecting that I would be okay for her to raise her child here. I told her that her apology is totally unnecessary, as her reaction was completely understandable considering the uncertainty of her future. I then told her that what I told all of you; that I would waive her rent for the remainder of her stay to help her get on her feet. She pushed back on this at first, but after I urged her to think of her child, she graciously accepted. Aside from this, I also told her about my friend who could help her out with finding some affordable listings in the area. I thought I might be overstepping there, but she was actually extremely thankful and said she would take me up on there.\n\nFinally, I want to thank u/tuttipeachyfrutti for probably the best piece of advice that I've read (I'm sure there are many more people that I should be thanking, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to read everything here). This was that I could help her obtain a more reliable work position at my hospital, nothing fancy as she doesn't have any schooling, but it will be much more secure than waitressing (and once you're in, there's always ways to work your way up). There would also be benefits/maternity leave that I don't think restaurants usually offer. This was probably my biggest risk of overstepping, but when I mentioned the idea to her she was actually over the moon (tears were shed...). I do agree that I acted in self interest here, so I think it's the least I can do to make sure this soon to be mother and her child have some sense of security in their lives. Thank you again to everyone.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*This isn't an edit, but more of a request. Does anyone here know if it's possible to change your title to include something like \"updated\". I really want everyone that commented to know that they all made a huge impact on a new mothers life. I can't thank you enough, very glad that I made this post.** \n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Hello. My girlfriend, myself, my parents, and my brother and his wife all went on vacation in another country a week ago. My brother and I were the ones who did most of the planning of the itinerary although we did ask everyone else for input. For background, I make around $150,000k as an IT consultant, my girlfriend is a teacher making $45,000k. My parents are pretty affluent as well as my brother and sister in law.\n\nMy girlfriend knew this trip was coming up and took on a second job waitressing on the weekends for several months to get ready for it. We have always split things 50/50 in the 2 years we have been together. There were a few times on the vacation when she did not go on outings with us- wine tasting/scuba diving/etc. She also would only eat 2 meals a day, simply stating that she was on a budget. My family does favor more high-end (\\*expensive\\*) places. My parents thought it was very strange that she only eats 2 meals a day although normally she eats 3. \n\nWhen we got home I asked her why she skipped out on several of the outings and only ate 2 meals a day- I mentioned how I heard her stomach growling one night and said I was concerned about her having an eating disorder. She got teary eyed and said that 3 meals a day wasn't fiscally feasible for her and neither were the outings that she chose not to go on (she went on 3 of 6 outings). She said she was not expecting everything to cost so much and she was overwhelmed. \n\nShe also said she doesn't know if this is going to work long term if she is expected to go on vacations like that with people who make so much more than her. I feel bad that I did not pick up on her discomfort sooner. But we did agree to split everything 50/50 and I don't know why she agreed to come if the cost was an issue.",

        "text": "My sister in law and I have an agreement. She watches my kids 3 days a week, and I watch hers 3 days a week. This agreement has stood since March 2020 without issues. Any changes have been discussed weeks in advance.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had an argument. The next day, I brought my kids to her house, dropped them off, and left. I didn't speak to my sister in law, because when one of us is in a rush, like I was, it's standard for us to just let the kids out, stay in the car, and drive off when you see the door open.\n\nI drove to work, about 40 minutes away. When I got there, I had about 20 missed calls, and even more texts, all from my sister in law, all saying she didn't want to watch the kids given our argument. Her first text arrived a little before I got to her place, but I didn't see it until I got to work because my phone is always on silent when I drive. I rang her, said I'll arrange to work from home, then come get the kids. She said I have 45 mins to get back to her place or she would call the police.\n\nI told my supervisor the situation, and she said I could leave after I did a few things. This delayed me 20 mins. When I got back to my sister in law's, just over an hour later, she said she'd already called the police when the 45 mins ran out. I then had to stick around long enough to tell the officer that I didn't abandon my children, there was just a communication issue.\n\nSister in law and I had another shouting match later over this. I arranged other childcare for my kids and I've been mostly ignoring her since. However, she reached out and apologised, and has asked if I'd be willing to go back to the old childcare arrangement. I've told her to go fuck herself.\n\nI work with kids. If I got child abandonment on my record, I would never work in my field again, which she knew, and her calling the police was a *massive* overreaction, so if she needs a babysitter she can go whistle for all I care. She said that if I checked my phone, talked to her that morning, or came back when I was supposed to, she would not have needed to call the police, and I did this to myself, as she gave me a warning with that first text and I could have checked my phone or spoken to her directly when I got to her place, all of which she says she would have done if she were in my position, given that we'd argued the night before. I've told her that if she thinks I'm babysitting for her, she's fucking delusional, and she's on her own.\n\nBecause of my refusal, it's looking like she may have to quit her job because my brother and her would pay more for a babysitter than they would earn from her working. My mother and brother have both called me an arsehole because there were no consequences to her calling the police, and that while she overreacted, she's apologised, so if I really forgive her, I'll let us move on. This income loss would also mean that she, my brother, and my niece and nephew might need to move somewhere cheaper, that my brother might have to take on extra hours at work, and in an extreme scenario they may even be completely unable to live independently, meaning they'd have to move in with her parents, who live several hours away.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "\n\nI (M30) got married 2 weeks ago. I was married before but it ended after I found out that my older brother Thomas (M34) got involved with my first wife. It was devastating because we were close and had a great relationship. I also helped him so much while he was struggling and seeing how he repaid me hurts to this very day. \n\nI stopped talking to him and Mom and dad forced me to keep it a secret and because I was too weak to argue with them, I just kept my owm distance.\n\n\nThen I met my now wife. my family loved and embraced her as their own. mom and dad treat her like a queen which helped repaire and soldified my relationship with them. However, as the wedding was approaching they told me they expected me to invite Thomas. I of course refused but they kept guilting me about what the relatives and other guests would think and say when they don't see Thomas there. I fought with them about it til the day of the wedding. Turned out they'd invited him behind my back but I found out and stopped them in time.\n\n\n\nThey came to the wedding looking pissed asking what we were going to tell people when they ask about Thomas. I told them I'd take care of it. and what I did was take a moment while everyone was paying attention, grabbed the mic and flatout announced this and said \"the reason I didn't invite Thomas to my wedding is because I was worried he'd steal my now wife just like he stole the first one\" I said it playfully to not make it sound so tense but most of the guests looked shocked and started mumbling then it went awkwardly quiet for a moment. then we moved on but I saw Mom and Dad walk out while looking at me grudgingly.\n\n\nLater they started lashing out about how I just exposed Thomas and caused him to be shunned by the family in the most hideos of ways. I told them that I already said I didn't want him there yet they tried to push him on me repeatedly saying \"what are people going to say\" so I told them the reason why he wasn't there in a playful way but they (the guests) still got the message. Mom started yelling about how everyone will now look down on and shun Thomas, she called me pathetic and cruel for still punishing him and gradually ruining his life despite him apologizing and trying to reconcile but in my opinion? somethings are just unforgivable.\n\n\nWe've been on horrible terms since then. AITA? My wife said at least now they're off my back about what people would say about not inviting him.",

Prior to sending it, I wanted to ensure I had proper cameras in the event he decided to make things worse. When I installed the camera, the neighbor must have realized why it was installed because they stopped doing all the annoying stuff.\n\nThen, about a month later, they listed their house for sale. They've moved out and we don't have to deal with their entitled asshole attitude anymore!\n\nI appreciate all the assistance and support as I was really unsure if I was going in the right direction.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify. I do not believe that the neighbor moved because of anything I did or asked him to stop doing. I think he had been planning to move for some time and was just an absolute dick of a person. They didn't move because of me, and even if they did, they sold the house for $200,000 more than they bought it 3 years ago. So he is not some victim.\n\nI do appreciate all the kind words. I am also bummed that so many people have shitty neighbors as well.",

        "text": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.\n\nMe and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.\n\nLast year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.\n\nAs she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'.\n\nSince I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. \n\nUnfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.\n\nEDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

My son loves this dog and does all the care for him (except vet stuff) and is a very responsible dog owner. This dog is pretty much his best friend.\n\nMy wife is 12 weeks pregnant, and ever since we confirmed the pregnancy she has been acting weird around the dog. She avoids him, puts her hands over her stomach when he is around and jolts whenever he makes noise. Today she told me she wants to re-home the dog. I asked her what she was talking about.\n\nShe said she has been having anxiety that he will jump on her. This is completely unreasonable. He doesn't jump on people. We trained him not to jump on people or run into people very young because he is half Great Dane and I felt this was important for all dogs, but especially one who could possibly grow to such a large size (which he did). There is no reason for her to think the dog will jump on her.\n\nShe said that there is no way to know for sure that the dog won't jump on her, and if he does our baby could be hurt. This dog has never so much as growled at her. She said even if the dog doesn't jump on her, her anxiety about it is bad for her health. She said she needs the dog elsewhere for her safety and the baby's.\n\nI told her that there was no way. My son got this dog right after he lost his mom and imprinted on him hard. Sometimes I think he loves the dog more than me! I'm not taking his dog. The dog didn't do anything!\n\nMy wife said I am prioritizing the dog over her pregnancy. The dog isn't a threat to her pregnancy. If this were any other unreasonable request, I would just do it because she is pregnant. I just can't break my son's heart over a fear she has that makes no sense. Am I being an asshole?",

I didn\u2019t want her scared away so I told her I had a bad childhood and left it at that. \n\nA little over two years into our relationship, I felt somewhat comfortable opening up and for the first time I told her exactly why I\u2019m infertile which is a direct result of an injury I suffered due to trauma as a child. She was really empathetic and I was just thankful I had found the one I want to spend my life with that also came with a kid I adore. \n\nFast forward to last summer. My partner and her friend decided to play an impromptu prank on me. I came home from work, there were multiple positive pregnancy tests in the bathroom. My partner announced she was pregnant, I started freaking out\u2026a happy freak out cause I thought I had hit the lottery with the slim to none chance I have. They both started laughing, the tests were from the friend and not my partner. \n\nI was pretty much devastated and felt really let down that my partner would actually pull a prank like that. At first she was shocked by my reaction and said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d know it was a joke considering your circumstances.\u201d She ended up apologizing after realizing how hurt I was. \n\nNow for the point of the post. Three weeks ago she arranged a huge dinner with her entire family at our house. She had us play this stupid mystery game and ultimately announced to everyone she\u2019s pregnant. Her mother and sisters were deliriously happy. Immediately I got pissed thinking this was yet another prank, so I showed absolutely no emotions which everyone caught on to. I said to my partner, \u201cEither you\u2019re just mentally disturbed or you\u2019re cheating.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much when all hell broke loose. \n\nMy partner\u2019s POV is that she was sincerely apologetic about the prank and I should know her well enough to not think she\u2019d ever pull that stunt again. She\u2019s also livid at me for ruining the announcement, embarrassing her in front of her entire family, causing them to think I\u2019m a horrible person and then finally insinuating that she\u2019s a cheater. \n\nI still stand by my claim that had she never pranked me, my reaction would have been different. I do find it odd she decided to tell me along with her family. Things would have likely went over better had she told me first, and then we announced it together. But I\u2019m starting to think I acted immaturely causing scene in front of her family, and I think that\u2019s maybe where I\u2019m wrong.",

His chores are too clean his room,  help with laundry and set the table for supper. I get paid by the state and you better believe I make sure his needs are met. He's my little bud. \n\nAt the end of the month for each day he does his chores he gets a sticker, at the end of the month that sticker gets counted as 5$ and he uses the money for whatever he wants.  Like toys, special snacks etc. He loves this. \n\nHe's been so good lately with chores I took him out for burgers and fries and took him to the toy store. My brother is big.  Not fat, just tall and actually big boned (he's healthy weight and overall health), he gets excited and stims by flapping his hands, you do you little dude. \n\nAt the toystore he announced he wants Barbie's,  cool,  no judgement,  and we go look at barbies. He's stimming and rambling about what he wanted and meanwhile a lady and little girl come in the aisle. Not even two minutes pass and the lady tells us to go to another aisle, she wants to look at the dolls and his weird hand movements are freaking her out.  I tell her to wait her turn. \n\nNot even another minute passes and she tells my brother to knock it off and go look at something else. Now I'm pissed. I tell my brother to get what he wants and looked at her and told her, her daughter could use a better role model, I'd hate for her to turn into such a grouchy hag. Took my brother out to pay for his barbies all while ignoring her telling me how much of an asshole I am for saying that in front of her daughter. \n\nAITA?",

        "text": "I've \\[F21\\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. \n\n\nIt came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. \n\n\nAs I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says \"Dear, will you sit down for just another moment.\" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. \"With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,\". I looked at her like \"what the fuck\" and she continued \"well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,\". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say \"you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,\".\n\nI was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don\u2019t want to go after anybody\u2019s job, but I don\u2019t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. \n\nWill I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?\n\nEdit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said \u201cI appreciate your openness and honesty tho\u201d (like that mattered after anything she just said \ud83d\ude29) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said \u201cthanks\u201d and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn\u2019t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. \n\nAlso, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. \n\nAnd for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I\u2019m having more fun than u \ud83d\ude18\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nBefore I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. \n\n1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. \n\n2) for ever man calling me a slut: you\u2019re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so \u201cclosing my legs\u201d or \u201cquit being easy\u201d doesn\u2019t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single \u201cwhore\u201d had one thing in common and that\u2019s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! \n\n3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody\u2019s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. \n\nNow to the update: \nI called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn\u2019t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. \n\nFirst and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. \n\nI explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she\u2019s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. \n\nI then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn\u2019t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. \n\nThe lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she\u2019d \u201ccall the doctor (her supervisor)\u201d right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn\u2019t be back in the office until next Monday. \n\nWith all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You\u2019ve truly been so helpful. \n\nAnd for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn\u2019t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",

        "text": "A story as old as time. My (f27) father (50) cheated on my mother for 5 years with a younger woman(currently 32) and he left my mother when mistress got pregnant. It tore our family apart.\n\nI resent my father because my mother actually loved him and she is still dealing with this. Even 1 year after he left her.\nI stayed on okay terms with him because I was the one to pick up and drop off my younger brother at his place.\n\nLast week when I picked up my brother my father had big news. He proposed to his girlfriend and wanted me as his best (wo)man. It made me kinda mad ngl. But I kept calm... And told him no. He said that what happened between him and mom was none of our business and that I should respect his new relationship. I said I respect it but that doesn't mean I condone it. Obviously I would never hound him randomly about it but I don't approve of it and I don't like her. She knew the whole time my mom and we existed .\n\nWell my dad was having none of it and told me to get off my high horse because I had cheated too and I had no right.\nAnd I.... Guess?\nWhen I was 17 I was with this boy for 3 months. I went to a party got shit faced and made out with a classmate for a total of 10 minutes. I felt so bad that I called my boyfriend crying and we talked it out. We broke up. I told my dad and In 10 years I never did something like that again. I have been with my partner for 5 years.\nI told him he could not equate it at all. He called me a hypocrite. And that he was glad to know who I am.\n\nDriving home I felt like I was a bit harsh. He is still my father and he is not a bad father. I just don't want to be in his wedding. I would still go. But AITA,?",

I did not agree on this but he had this car before we got together so it's a shared property. besides that I have my own car so that did not affect me til my husband started complaining about having to commute to work and hangout places. He tried to get me to let him drive my car several times but I stood firm and put a boundary making him understand that my car will never be driven by him (one of the reasons why is because of how bad his driving is).\n\n\nHis brother lives out of town. My husband asked if he could drive my car to the wedding but I refused but not because I'm not imvited (another story for another day) buy because like I said my car is off limits. He threw a fit calling me unreasonable to let him take public transportation because he can barely stand it for 10 minutes let alone hours.  I said it wasn't my problem which irritated him but made him stop arguing about it.\n\n\nThe day that he was supposed to travel out of town. I woke at 10am and couldn't find my car key. I went outside and couldn't find my car either. I was beyond pissed. I called him and like I expected, he took it and was on his way to the other town. I lost it and told him I gave him no permission to take it for whole 5 days and said that if he won't turn around with it and come home then I'd call the cops and report it missing. His response was \"You wouldn't dare do it cause you know what would happen\" I hung up on him then immediately called the police and told them about my situation. I did NOT tell them my husband took it because they'd think it's a family dispute and decide to not get involved. I just reported it missing.\n\n2 hours later I got a call from my husband saying he was back in town and was being held at our local police station. I went to the station and talked to the cops. My husband made a scene there swearing over and over that I gave him permission to take it and said I was acting out of jealousy and spite because he was going to attent a wedding that I was not invited to. I took my car and went home but he had to stay a little longer.\n\nHe came home in the evening and went on a rage fit about how I created an awful situation and almost caused him to miss his brother's wedding. He called me vindictive, bitter and a lunatic to call the police on him and try to accuse him of stealing my car. He had to leave the same day to be able to be there with his family and decided to extent his stay and he still hasn't gotten back yet.\n\nRight now his mom and brother are blasting me for what happened and calling me spiteful.",

I used to own of variety of jewelry sets but due to unfortunate circumstances most of them had to go so I could afford rent after I lost my job. My husband never got lucky to land a job since 2013. Thankfully now I have a stable job that gets us by from month to month.\n\n\nI also kept one set of jewelry which is the most valuable wether momentarily and/or sentimentally since it's part of family herilom. The set includes a pair of earings - a bracelet and - a necklace. All gold material and again they are worth decent amount of money. My BIL has been with then gilfriend for 10 years and they recently got married. It was a huge deal for the family. My husband wanted to get them a decent wedding gift and tried borrowing money from friends and neighbors but got turned down. He kept stressing out about it for weeks and just the other day (the wedding was days prior and the groom and bride are off to their honeymoon) I discovered that my jewelry set was gone. I freaked after my husband nonchantly said he gifted it to his brother's wife as a wedding gift. I was fuming I asked how could he and he replied that he had no money and nothing of value to give the newly weds and besides that that set has been sitting in the closet since July, 2019 and I never wore any piece of it so he figured I'd forgotten about it but he said he'll figure a way to pay me or get me a similar one once he starts working but I very loudly told him andolutely not and gave him 3 days, just 3 days to return the set or I'll stop paying for everything in the apartment. He looked puzzled like he couldn't believe I was serious. He said he doesn't want to cause an issue but I said it's already there  and if he doesn't want issues all he has to do is contact his brother or his wife and retrieve the set or go get it himself. He tried to twist the argument and offer the same solutions as mentioned above but I refused I said I just want my set back and he has 3 days only. He kept talking about how tasteless and disrespectful it'd be for him to retreive a wedding gift and said this will damage his relationship with his brother and family and also how impossible it was to retreive the set in 3 days when the couple are on their honeymoon in another country.\n\nAITA for this? He said I was financially abusing him by threatening to stop paying for anything knowing I'm the breadwinner. Also he refused to give me their new contact info to retreive the set myself.",

        "text": "Ok guys I\u2019m extremely tried and it\u2019s been a long ass day so please excuse any poor grammar or spelling mistakes \n\n\nTo begin my brother Ben (39m fake name ) has been in a relationship with Abby(39 fake name) 18 years. They\u2019ve been engaged 8 years they\u2019ve nearly gotten married 3 years ago but months before the wedding Ben chickened out. \n\nThey went to therapy and basically because our dad left us he has issues with commitment.\nWe thought over the last year he was finally gonna step up for Abby and be the partner she deserves. He did seem a bit anxious leading up to the big day but assured everyone he was ok \n\n\nToday they were meant to get married but as abby and us bridesmaids were about to enter the church Ben was no where to be found \n\nEveryone tried to calm her down saying it was traffic or he probably had a monster hangover.\nWell an hour passed, than two, than three and than after the four hour mark Abby said fuck she was going back to the hotel call her when he landed.\n\nMy family looked panicked and nervous trying to get through to Ben or the groomsmen who had not arrived yet \n\nMy other brothers and brother in laws (sister\u2019s husband) went looking for him thinking he got hurt or arrested the night before \n\nI went back to the hotel with a very broken looking Abby. We drank and ate food for another hour before I got a text from my brother in law saying they found him in a bar and they were trying to talk him into GOING TO HIS OWN WEDDING. My sister rang her husband and heard him in the background  he was literally acting like a 5 year old who didn\u2019t want to go to the doctor \n\nHonestly guys I had enough at this stage he mess this girl about too long and frankly leading someone along for 18 years is just cruel \n\n\nSo he\u2019s here\u2019s were I maybe the asshole of the century. I walked into Abby\u2019s room and told her be quiet than I rang my brother in law put him on loud speaker and asked him what was going on than for him to put Ben on the phone the drunk fool started saying shit like he didn\u2019t think she was the one and he is only with her because they\u2019ve been together to long and he is scared to be alone \n\nI let her hear everything I won\u2019t lie I felt like a monster when she started crying. Abby than grabbed the phone told him he had one hour to get to the church or it was over for good \n\n\nLong story short Ben ended up at the Church 20 minutes later and Abby took off her dress than left the hotel alone \n\nSo he ended being left a the Alter and she went on the honeymoon alone. I\u2019ve been disowned by everyone expect two siblings (sisters) and I had to get Abby\u2019s maid of honour to collect my suitcase from outside the hotel (mom dumped out when she found out) \n\nI\u2019m the full blame for ruining their relationship and 98% of my family hates me",

        "text": "Throwaway Account   \n\n\nI (33f) have had fertility issues for the past couple of years with my husband (35m). We went through with consultations and while we had very promising results for treatment the cost did give us pause. It wasn't that we couldn't afford it we just weren't at the point yet where we were willing to pay. I discussed it with my husband and we were both fine with the idea of adopting. \n\nMy cousin Tiffany (25f) is adopted and she supported our choice in looking into it. However this was a couple of years back and during that time Tiffany was reunited with her birth parents and she's been acting pretty hurtful to my aunt and uncle since then. She keeps making post about how happy she is to know where she comes from and is happy about being reunited with her \"real family.\" She even talked about having her birth father walk her down the aisle as a chance to make up for lost time. Obviously my uncle was very hurt about this but went he voiced it Tiffany got defensive. She called my uncle selfish, how this was about her and that he knew what he signed up for when raising someone else's kid.\n\nBefore the pandemic Tiffany moved closer to where her bio mother lived so they could make up for lost time, and Tiffany kept making post after post about all the fun she was having meeting relatives, and how she called/video chatted with each of her bio parents multiple times a week meanwhile she barely texted back my uncle and aunt once a month. I could tell how heartbroken my aunt and uncle were but tried to give Tiffany her space and the few times they said anything she accuse them of being selfish and unsupportive. I think the biggest thing that broke them was when Tiffany promised to come by for my aunt's birthday (COVID restrictions were lifted) and was even given the money to travel to them but then never showed up. She called literally the day before to say that her bio mom had an emergency so she wasn't going to make it, but didn't give back the money. \n\nI am completely disgusted by Tiffany's behavior and while I haven't completely ruled out adoption entirely I did want to give medical assisted conception a try. My husband supported this and we are now currently expecting. After we made our announcement Tiffany messaged me asking why I would spend thousands on creating a child when I could helped one who already existed. I tried to play it off but Tiffany kept pressing and calling me a bad person when there are so many children who desperately need a home and overpopulation. It got to the point where she was pissing me off and I just came clean and said that her behavior towards the people who loved and raised her was the reason. Tiffany got really upset but I didn't care, however, her parents are now starting to say that I was wrong so AITA?",

I have a friend named Kate we've been together since we were kids. She's like a sister to me although she tends to boss me around. She's introduced me to her female friends hoping that I'll settle down again. I told her I have other priorities and I'm required to focus on Sean and his health (he's diabetes). Kate thinks there's something wrong with me but Not everyone's circumstances the same. I started noticing a pattern in her behavior after she introduced me to a friend of hers. She'd tell me to leave Sean at home when we hang out and meet her friends. She'd tell me to take down any pictures that have my son and wife in it because ladies will \"assume\" that I'm a single dad or still married and that'd limit my chances in dating. I told her to knock it off. And she said that she was looking out for my \"social\" life saying I'm ruining it and exhausting myself. I stopped talking to her for days. Then I decided to let it go.\n\nShe's been insisting on bringing her friend to visit me with other friends. I agreed to have them as guests. Kate suggested I take Sean to stay with a relative since it'll be adult dinner but I refused. He was comfortable in his home and didn't wanna go. Kate was at my place before her friends arrived. I checked on Sean and told him to tell me if he needed anything before he went to sleep.\n\nAt 12:30 while I was sitting and just starting to chat with Kate's friend while Kate kept blinking at me with a smirk on her face. I got a text message from Sean telling me he wanted to use the bathroom but the door handle was stuck and he couldn't open the door. I went upstairs to check. Kate followed me. I found that the door was actually locked. I was confused I asked Sean and he said he didn't lock it. I started looking for the key that's when Kate quietly handed it to me saying she took it. I was stunned. I opened the door for Sean then I asked her why she locked the door she said that lied to her friend about me not having kids and didn't want her to see Sean. She said it was no big deal since he was sleeping but I was furious. I started yelling at her as she kept shushing me. Everyone started leaving after I yelled at Kate and cussed her out for doing this.\n\n\nShe blew up after her friend left and said I was an idiot cause most people don't mention kids until after months into dating. And that I didn't deserve her help to move on when she thought I was a decent \"sane\" person. I called her stupid and told her to get out of my house. She told me to wallow in my misery and left. Then her friends kept blaming me for making a scene and treating Kate like that especially since she cooked dinner and helped a lot.",

I said no because I had to go study and also she does this every monday so clearly it wasn't important or urgent but she insisted it was, I told her sorry but no. She ended the call then I went to the university.\n\n\nHours later, I got a call from my brother in law asking where my sister was, I said I had no idea. he proceeded to tell me he just came home at 1pm and found his son by himself at the house. I was in shock that my sister left her stepkid by himself so she could go God knows where. I told him about the conversation I had with her and he got angry.\n\nIn the evening my sister came over and started making a scene by yelling at me for bailing on her after she sent me a text message telling me she was already out the house to force me to come watch her stepson. I didn't see the fb message til she told me but she said I did this deliberately and also, exposed her to her husband because she told him she'd be at home with the kid. Not just that, but I also told her husband that mom comes over every monday morning to watch the kid for few hours which caused a huge fight between him and my sister. She yelled that I was petty and selfish and just stirred shit and caused issues in her marriage by tattling to her husband. I couldn't keep arguing I went into my room and started playing music. My dad and the others said I was to blame for not helping my sister and now being the reason she and her husband are in conflict.\n\n\nAITA?\n\nOkay guys so I saw few questions asked multiple times so I'll just put the answers out here for all to see.\n\n1) My brother in law's wife is deceased.\n\n2) brother in law is always at work when my sister calls my mom to get her to come over and watch her stepson.\n\n3) most of you guys are asking where my sister goes every monday, and I even saw someone mention that I was YTA for not finding out, but I don't know anything, I have no idea what's going with my sister and I thought it was non of my business.\n\n\nUPDATE: Guys! I've decided to try and find out what is really going with Jess. I'm not the type to snoop and it's not my business but she already made it my business by turning the family against me because of something she did. Ngl I came here thinking I was going to get toast but I wrong, thank goodness for that. I'll update as soon as possible. Thanks :)",

The rest of the team and I have been busting our humps day in and day out moderating away the very worst vitriol and troll traffic we find in this space and we think we've earned the right to consider our growing forum **NOT the most evil place on reddit**...maybe even not bottom five.  This is just ducky, but we think we can do more to make this a positive and generous place, even if we can't get y'all to behave all the time.   In addition to being really jazzed about telling others how to act, we have also discovered that we're a cabal of unapologetic dog lovers punctuated by a few weirdos who like cats.\n\nWith that in mind, we've decided to try to do some good with our moralizing, finger-wagging forum by trying something new:\n\n# The Rescue Dog of the Moment\n\nIf you miss the cute segment on morning news when they bring out a group of local shelter pets, to get them a publicity bump, but you never get to see that because *who the hell is watching local morning news anymore,* then this post is for YOU!\n\n# [This is Hazel](https://imgur.com/gallery/tAqmmCX)!\n\nHazel is a 4 year old Rottweiler/Boxer(?)/Pittie(?) who's been living in her foster home for 2 years waiting for her furever home.  She's healthy and happy.  She is a sweet, gentle lady who loves to kiss faces and is prone to occasional bursts of silliness.\n\nShe's available to adopters in and around New England.  If you'd like to consider giving Hazel the home she richly deserves, her adoption profile is here: [https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/](https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/) (And if you DO eventually adopt her, be sure to come back here to brag so you can be sub hero for a week!)\n\nIf you aren't in the Northeast, but have the kindness to adopt a dog in need, try searching for a rescue organization on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/animal-shelters-and-rescues/search/). I promise that there are many great dogs and probably many great rescue orgs in your area!\n\n**Some ground rules:**\n\nThe way it works is we're going to sticky this post until Hazel gets a home with a \"furever\" family.  We're not going to show you a dog and say he's on death row.  We're not going to shock or depress you with a canine trainwreck and ask for donations for vet bills.  We'll just keep one happy pup's picture up, while she's safe in a loving foster home, and hope that you'll share her pics and check out her rescue site until somone takes this lovable little fuzzface home.  If a subscriber does adopt her, we'll even keep her  sticky post up for a while after adoption, giving the adopter plenty of time to brag about their new furkid and post happy pictures of their new best goodgirl at home.  **Let's see if 1.5 million potential assholes can bring a family together before the year's over!**\n\nIf you don't want to see rescue dogs, all you have to do is ignore one sticky post, quit yer whining, and enjoy the sub as usual.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a board member of Hazel's rescue.  No money is changing hands and no considerations are being offered or transferred between us.  I just want to make room for one more deserving dog to get out of the shelter system and get as many of you thinking about fostering, rescuing, and adopting-not-shopping as possible.\n\nP.S. If you happen to be Chrissy Teigen, please tweet about this!\n\n*Edit:  It seems there is a substantial group of people with hatred for dogs or specific breeds out there on reddit, and they have come to this discussion to try to spoil a good thing with baseless accusations fueled by paranoia. Whenever any dog has shown the slightest interest in chasing cats (or in Hazel's case, because she has chased squirrels and rabbits in her foster's yard), the rescue puts the exaggerated statement \"They think that cats are tasty treats\" into the Petfinder description so that no one with a cat becomes interested, and we never have to risk an adopter irresponsibly mixing that dog with their cat. Hazel has NO history of aggression against people or cats.  --Anyone saying she was abandoned because of either of these things is making up stories.--*  \n\n*Out of abundant concern, the rescue will not place her with any households that will mix her with cats. As for small children...there is no history of aggression toward people of any age. It's my feeling that a healthy and friendly 65lb dog who occasionally runs around with excitement can knock little kids down and bump them by accident. (Ever have a dog headbutt you because you were leaning over them when they decided to jump up? That kind of thing.) The rescue will explain her energy level in detail to any family with small children who applies and let them decide if they think their child is old/large/mature enough to handle this. In some cases, the rescue will make that evaluation and not approve the application. This is a very thoughtful, careful process that is carried out in private between the individual who applies and the co-ordinator who knows the dog much better than I (or anyone in a comment stream making gross assumptions) does.*",

I\u2019m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. \n\nWhen I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. \n\nThis has put a strain on my mothers and I\u2019s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. \nShe didn\u2019t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I\u2019d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn\u2019t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. \n\nPeople ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this \u201cfamily friend\u201d. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. \n\nI\u2019ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. \n\nMy mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it\u2019s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she\u2019s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it\u2019s been years, why else would you want to catch up?\n\nMy new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn\u2019t agree with it, it\u2019s been years, he wasn\u2019t in her life yet.\n\nShe asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; \n\n\u201cTo be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy\u2019s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn\u2019t ruin this one, but why don\u2019t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?\u201d\n\nShe cried, said she couldn\u2019t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven\u2019t spoken for a few days.\n\nToday, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy\u2019s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she\u2019s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I\u2019m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",

Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few years after we married I decided to go to law school. Long story short, I ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. Since I managed not to go into debt, I have a good bit of money left over after I make my contributions to our joint expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that I get to buy most of the things I want while she is on a much more limited budget), and I told her I would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. I think fair is fair since this was her idea, but I do wonder if  I am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "I [M47] been with my wife for 2 years. She has a 21 year old son. I have a 14 year old daughter from my previous marriage. My late wife passed away in 2014. She left a few things for our daughter. Including a gold jewelry set. Her mom was devastated she didn't get to gift the set to our daughter on her wedding day. I keep it in my closet since it's expensive and my daughter is too young to have it. I'll hopefully gift it to her on her wedding.\n\nLast week. We were sitting in the kitchen when my stepson was hesitant to ask me something. We're in good terms but have our fair share of arguments. He said his fianc\u00e8e was taking something from his mother's and my closet. saw the jewellery set and liked it very much. He asked if he could borrow it so his fianc\u00e8e can wear it at her cousin's wedding. I found this unacceptable I told him his fianc\u00e8e had no business being in the bedroom and that the jewellery isn't mine. It's for my daughter. He asked me if my daughter will agree to let him borrow it if he talked to her. I told him not to even talk about it again. He got all pissed and said things I do not remember.\n\nSaturday night. When he and his fianc\u00e8e were at the wedding. I discovered that the jewellery set was gone. I told my wife and we looked all over the house. I called my stepson to tell him about calling the police because I really thought someone stole the set. He said there was no need. That he borrowed it and will return it after they get back from the wedding. I yelled at him and told him to come back with it right then. I kept calling him til 12am when he told me to stop calling and that he'd bring it in the morning.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night I felt terrible. In the morning he showed up at 10am. He didn't bring it and started stalling saying: \"he forgot\"- \"he'd bring it the next day\". At this point it was clear he gifted it to his fianc\u00e8e and was stalling. I got so mad I told him I will be pressing charges if he doesn't return the set today. We got into an argument\nMy wife said his fiancee was the one who wanted the jewelry set. But he was the one who took it and it's not even mine it's my daughter's which made it worse. Because I'm responsible for whatever happens to it.\n\nHis grandparents berated me after I told them this and got mad and defended him when I said that I will be pressing charges. he stole and needed to be responsible for his actions He didn't respond to my final calls so now I've given him one last chance and it's over\n\nI pressed charges today. They're saying calling the police was extreme and cruel. They're all convincing me to back down.\n\nAita for pressing charges?\n\nHe was replying to me sarcastically when I said I'd get the authorities involved and he didn't take me seriously. His mom said she'd try to talk to him but I had enough of him stalling hoping I'll just let it go. So he can make his fianc\u00e8e happy.\n\nI feel like an irresponsible idiot. I can't even look at my daughter without feeling frustrated and infuriated. I'm hurt but what's worse is that this is my daughter's property that I couldn't take care of.\nMy wife allows them into the room although I told her not to several times they're not kids and there should be some boundaries.\n\nI just needed to mention that We're in Europe.",

        "text": "So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago). \n\nMy boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now? \n\nOur rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college. \n\nIs the idea that my DAD doesn\u2019t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it?\n\nEDIT: Jake and I still split utilities and groceries 50/50, and when we go out on date nights, we switch off who pays for it. If he pays one week, i\u2019ll pay the next.",

We lived together for 6 years and known each other for 20 years (close families)  He was very accepting that I came with a cat, I paid for everything and legally owned her. He adored her though and would spend hours cuddling her.  I owned everything, all the furniture and the white goods because I had lived out of home before but he had not.\n\nHe got a GF at the 3.5 year mark and she practically moved in immediately. I still paid half the rent though. She was always very rude to me and clearly didn't want me alone with my friend.  There was only one lounge, attached to the kitchen, so he and I would previously watch TV together or just be in the same room while another cooked, worked etc. When she moved in that 'had to stop' because I was interfering with their couple time. Her attitude towards me got worse over time and my friend started treating me badly. They would leave sex toys all over the place, watch movies late and loud when my  bedroom was right there, glare at me if I cooked during their couple time even though they hogged the TV between 4-9pm.\n\nI got a bf and started spending a lot of time with him.  After this things got worse.  My friend began locking my cat in small cages and putting her the shower. He also began talking differently to me and leave the kitchen in a absolute mess (mould) to make it difficult for me to cook. I found used condoms in the lounge.  It then got to the stage where we wouldn't talk but all the tormenting was still going on.\n\nI decided to leave and started looking for somewhere else.  The lease was up in 4 months but we had not discussed what we wanted to do. I found out through his sister (and a close friend of mine) that they had been saving up this whole time to move out and would be moving in a few weeks'. This was news to me. I couldn't afford the rent by myself.\n\nI found a place before they did, spoke to the estate agent and advised them of the situation - turns out he had not been paying his full share of the rent and she was not listed as living there. The agent did not hold me accountable for any of it.  I paid 4 weeks' leave before I left. I didn't tell them when I was leaving and on a day when they were not home my friends helped me pack up and leave.  The house was cleaned spotless.  I also took all of my furniture, whitegoods and kitchenware - so basically everything but his room! I took my cat.\n\nAfter I left I received hundreds of missed calls and messages from them abusing me for not notifying them and taking everything and MY cat. Most of his family also messaged me telling me what an AH I am. My parents knew what I was doing, supported me but have also called me an AH because our families are still not exactly on speaking terms.",

Further detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/0587throwaway/comments/ktb7u0/peg_comments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \nHonestly, I\u2019ve never more immediately regretted something. This exploded. Spectacularly. \n\nI went to HR, saying that the matter was settled, but I wanted it documented; subsequently was told that there would be an investigation and the incidents would be corroborated with witnesses, because as is the full record I claim is \u201csevere enough to warrant potential action\u201d for Pey and several other coworkers who also engaged in her behavior. HR started the process, apparently immediately, because I walked in yesterday to a shitstorm. \n\nThis plunged the department into civil war. Many agree Peg was out of line, some told me I should\u2019ve kept the status quo, some said I was ungrateful and entitled. One said I should have handled this \u201cmaturely\u201d and \u201cwho could blame her\u201d when I look \u201clike that\u201d, and I should be ashamed of myself. Another coworker suggested I work from home. Another told me he was sorry for not stepping in. I went to go get my lunch out of the fridge only to find someone had disposed of it and left behind the empty Tupperware. Nearly everyone has an opinion. The people in my corner have advised me to keep my head down and to take care. \n\nMy boss held a meeting, first with Peg and me, then a second with just me. During the one with Peg, I was told to apologize for my part and Peg likewise. (\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable by caring about your health.\u201d). My boss asked if I was \u201csatisfied now\u201d. I brought up Peg\u2019s comments and my boss said I invited them, no one would call that harassment, and I need to work on myself. Together we went through each of the 23 events. She excused each of them until I was left to feel like I\u2018d been harassing Peg.\n\nThe next meeting was even worse. Effectively Boss said, \u201cI told you not to retaliate and instead you searched Peg out to harass her\u201d and \u201cyour actions have expressed a worrying lack of cooperation with me and your team.\u201d She was also disappointed that instead of explaining that I needed her to resolve things, I \u201cescalated the situation well beyond the point of reason\u201d and cruel to someone who only wanted to help. She said I won\u2019t get far in life and I\u2019m not likely to get anywhere vocationally if I can\u2019t be a team player and \u201cactively sabotage a happy workplace\u201d. She hoped I will learn from this \u201cteachable moment\u201d how to behave in a collaborative environment as it\u2019s inappropriate to involve HR for \u201csmall misunderstandings\u201d. \n\nBF is spitting mad. I\u2019m just... tired, confused and hurt. HR seemed sympathetic. Boss is very clearly on Peg\u2019s side. The office is split and tense. Currently updating my resume and job searching. It really does feel like a nightmare. Haven\u2019t felt good going in to work for a while, and this just made it times worse.",

        "text": "My husband \"Mickey\" loves his mom's cooking. He always praises her for the food she makes and even mentioned it in his groom speech at the wedding!\n\n\nI consider myself a good cook. In fact, I'm going to just say that I'm even better than his mom. but the problem is he doesn't even want to try my cooking or give me a chance to prove it, I thought this would change after marriage but 5 months later nothing's changed. What does he eat if he's not eating what I'm cooking? He has requested that his mom send him a meal everyday to eat for dinner after getting off work except for the weekend where we go over to her house and eats breakfast, lunch, dinner and DESSERT there. \n\n\nEvery single day he'd come home and ask if his mom sent him a meal. I grew irritated of this and whenever I try to offer him to taste any of the (wasted) food I cook, he'd lay in bed and say he's full.\n\n\nSo I came up with an idea. I cooked him the same meal his mom sent him that day and put it aside til he got home. He asked if his mom sent a meal for dinner and I said yes and served him my own version of the meal - not hers. He didn't notice anything different. he ate the whole thing with no hasitation while I sat across from him asking him questions about how good the meal was. He went on and on praising it saying how perfect, exceptional it was, and how it was just what he needed after a long day at work.\n\n\nI smiled and said \"You're welcome\". He froze and looked at me for a minute. Looked down at the plate then back at me and said \"wait, you made this didn't you?\" I said \"With my own hand and from scratch\". His face suddenly went red and he got upset and said that this was not cool. I told him he never even gave me a chance to show him how good my cooking is and that he's probably just used to his mom's cooking and is rejecting any other alternatives which's unfair to me. He said that I shouldn't have lied to him and basically tricked him into eating food that he had no idea where it came from. I said he liked it and admitted that it was good so what's the issue. He got up from his seat, threw the napkin and said that I was unbelievable then walked out.\n\n\nHe got quiet the rest if the evening then posted about it on his FB in a vague post about being tricked into eating \"someone's\" food like that. I felt guilty and bad thinking maybe I really shouldn't have done this but I was frusrtated with how he kept turning down every meal I tried to cook him and then say \"No thanks, I prefer mom's food\".\n\n\nAITA?",

He lost his old job 3 months ago. My family lives 30min away and although it's been difficult this year I decided to get my brother (who has a chronic condition and struggled a lot lately and was in the hospital for a few days for anemia) the one thing he's been wanting for some time. I got him an Xbox that cost me 300$. He was so happy and I'm glad I was able to cheer him up during those times.\n\nMy fianc\u00e8 received a few gifts from his family. But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.\n\nWe were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fianc\u00e8 looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got/didn't get this year. That made them uncomfortable especially since they've been dealing with my brother's health issues and needed to relax.\n\nWe got home and my fianc\u00e8 took something from the closet and left for about an hour.\n\nI was asleep when he came back. In the morning I was surprised to find my brother's Xbox in the closet. I woke him and asked him about it. Turned out He dropped me off drove back to my family's house and exchanged the gift his aunt gave him (a 14$ fancy pen) with my brother's xbox. He said that my brother was happy to exchange gifts. I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.\nHe told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fianc\u00e8 pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted. He refused so I ended up taking it myself. My fianc\u00e8 argued when I took it and said that I was pressuring him and treating him poorly and have no respect for his feelings. I told him he was wrong to make my brother give him his gift and causing him stress and ruining his joy. I apologized to my brother and my parents and I felt awful because of how my fianc\u00e8 behaved. My fianc\u00e8 isn't talking to me saying that I have no consideration for his feelings and not understanding how he feels not having money to buy himself the things he likes.\n\nI'm surprised because he has never done anything like this before. I get that he's struggling with finding a job but this is not an excuse.",

        "text": "In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I\u2019ve lost him \n\nWe have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we\u2019ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed. \n\nIn February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she\u2019s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he\u2019s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It\u2019s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters. \n\nHer wedding day comes around and I just can\u2019t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn\u2019t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened. \n\nLast week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They\u2019d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away. \n\nShe immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn\u2019t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I\u2019m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA?\n\nEDIT - have your opinions, that\u2019s why I posted this. But do not come into my PMs and tell me I should\u2019ve been the one to die instead. You\u2019re worse than I am if that\u2019s what gets you off. Sending me death threats isn\u2019t okay either",

        "text": "So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.\n\nMy boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.\n\nFor an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.\n\nA few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.\n\nSo last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.\n\nHe doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).\n\nI've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.\n\n\nEdit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.\n\nThough I haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, I'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  Whether you think I'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and I appreciate that.",

Plus if she still refused a paternity test then, it would be more waiting around to get a court ordered test.\n\nMeaning no help from me at all for a while even after the baby is already here. So yeah she agreed to it in the end.\n\nHe\u2019s not mine. I just got the results day before yesterday. My ex didn\u2019t really have much to say. She only txted \u201cfine then I wont bother you anymore.\u201d \n\nI told her I was sorry and wished her luck. Also told her about what u guys commented about Facebook posts selling or giving away used baby stuff, plus the WIC program that could help her out since she\u2019s low income. But she didn\u2019t respond after that and haven\u2019t heard from her since so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll look into those. \n\nNot gonna lie I\u2019m a little disappointed. I know I was having my doubts about this baby being mine and was keeping my distance. But like I said, I was mentally and physically preparing incase he was so that I could be there as a father. Still feel that loss but at least now I know for sure. \n\nI appreciate everyone who commented and thanks for the info and advice.",

        "text": "I go hunting every year. I'm not a trophy hunter by any means I do it for meat and almost purely for economic reasons at this point. Taking a few of deer off my property once a year keeps my freezer stocked and the grocery bill way down which is important because finances can be tight sometimes. As a little relevant background the bulk of the meat is kept in a large freezer in the garage and about once a week we pull out what we will need for the next week or so. Which means the freezer is normally only opened about once a week.\n\nMy son (15) has decided that he is vegetarian about 6 months ago which my wife and I have no problems with. We started making meatless meals twice a week and made sure every other dinner was such that the meat was  separate from everything else so he could still eat with us. This has been working great for the last 6 months with no complaints. \n\nHowever, last week when I pulled the meat for the week out of our freezer in the garage he decided to come behind me and unplug the freezer. I guess he thought we weren't doing enough to support his cause? He never spoke to us or complained about our twice a week set up prior to unplugging the freezer.\n\nWell as you can imagine with a now unrefrigerated pile of meat in the summer heat it didn't take long for the meat to start to rot and stink. The freezer kept the smell in for a while so by the time we finally noticed everything was completely putrid.\n\nI asked my son if he knew what happened and he proudly said that he had unplugged it on purpose and now we would have to be meat free. I told him that he didn't have the right to ruin a freezer full of meat and raise the families grocery bill without discussing it with anyone. I told him that as part of his punishment he had to clean up his mess. Meaning dispose of all of the rotting meat and either sufficiently clean and sanitize the freezer or purchase a new one out of his savings.\n\nHe called me the AH for making him interact with meat in any form. But he made the mess he needs to clean it up. AITA?",

        "text": "[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/f49nth/aita_for_yelling_at_exdhs_gf_in_front_of_kids/) is the original post.\n\nIt's been quite a while. I wasn't planning on it, but many of you have personally messaged me asking for an update. Thank you for all the kindness and concern for my family.\n\nEarly March I was phoned at work by my neighbour saying my 10yo son was at her place. He had biked in the dark to my house. He told me that he'd left because GF had punished him for not joining a family bath in a way no one should support.\n\nOf course I went home immediately. I told my boss that I was leaving for the night, and I wasn't sure if I would return the next day. After checking if my son was okay, we went to Ex's house.\n\nAfter arriving, GF immediately started raging at S, but I shut that down very quickly. I went inside the house to collect my children, who were awake because GF was yelling very loudly. They cried and asked to come with me, which was absolutely horrible. To come to the house of your co-parent and to hear your children beg to leave. It took something from me. I put the children in the car, locked it, and went back inside to grab their essentials. This time, Ex followed me in and tried to excuse GF. I told him that he would not be welcome anywhere near the children until they wanted him to and I trusted him again. I also told him I would be suing for full custody and that my lawyer will contact him about buying out my part of the house. Nothing he said after that is worth repeating.\n\nI came back outside to find GF attacking my car trying to get the children. Things got very nasty and many things were said. She refrained me from reaching my car and the police had to be called. The officers allowed me to leave with my kids after a brief chat.\n\nI did not return to work until early April. Because of COVID19, my children went to my parents in the country. We videochat daily, my parents say the children are flourishing, though still very shocked and traumatised by what happened. They are talking with a therapist individually. My children have also been inspected by a physician for physical trauma, of which there is no sign, thank the stars.\n\nI will be taking my ex to court soon and will likely get full custody with paying alimony. The house will be put up for sale. Ex has formally been told that GF's presence will result in me fighting for no visitation.\n\nLastly, I did not end up losing my job. I have decided to get a professional live-in nanny and perhaps au-pair, and am looking into larger properties to accommodate everyone. The kids are very excited to come home to me in September. Thank you all very much.",

I had a sign posted on my art studio saying \u201cDO NOT ENTER\u201d and specifically made it clear to all guests that nobody was to enter that room. \nI\u2019d also like to note that all my guests were asked to leave their kids at home as this was for ADULTS but \u2018Lucy\u2019 couldn\u2019t do that because she couldn\u2019t find a sitter. Anyway. \n\nNote : I also set up my boyfriends PS4 for him to play on so he wouldn\u2019t be bored. \n\nIt\u2019s 10pm, and I hear a loud crash from my studio, I run up and see paint all over my recently work that so far had taken 15 hours to do. Ethan was sat there laughing, rubbing paint into my work, it\u2019s now unsalvageable and I have to restart the work, as it was a specific request from a client. Which also puts me behind for the rest of my work now!! \n\nI immediately asked Ethan and Lucy to leave, and the next day I sent her a bill for the work. \u00a32500 (which is LOWER than I would\u2019ve gotten for the work anyway). \n\nShe\u2019s absolutely screaming about it, the whole family is divided. My mom hates me, my dad completely agrees with me. Surprise, my dad is an artist, my mum is more \u2018smart smart\u2019.  My sisters husband agrees with me. \n \nI will admittedly say, I don\u2019t enjoy kids. Or their company. But I\u2019ve always been a great auntie, presents at Christmas, gifts from vacation, everything he\u2019s wanted. \n\nAm I the asshole for charging my sister \u00a32500?",

Note that I saved for the majority of treatment while my husband only paid 2-3 thousands. We saved up for another round after the huge disappointment and heartbreak from failing the first time (that's just how it goes). This time I'd put all the money (including dad's inhertance) and my husband didn't pay a cent.\n\n\nLast week I found out that he secretly pulled out 7k (we had 11k in total). I was completely and utterly shocked I confronted him and he casually reminded me of how many times his best friend complained about his \"old junk\" car and he decided to \"lend\" him 7k to buy a decent car, his argument was that his friend would've done the same for him. I was beyond livid I asked if he really thought that was okay and he said that I shouldn't worry and guaranteed his friend will pay us back in time. I lost it on him and immediately demanded his friend to send the money back and threatened police involvement in case he refused. His friend immediately returned the money but told my husband about the polic thing and my husband came home and yelled at me calling me unhinged and selfish. I told him I saved up some of this money/used my inheritance for this treatment while he contributed nothing even though we're in this together. He \"corrected\" me saying I'm the one with the problem and he thought it's only fair that I \"make up\" for it by paying for the IVF myself. This hurt so badly and I couldn't argue anymore. He went to stay with his friend while constantly shaming me for how I treated them both and for the police invovlement like they stole from me or something.",

        "text": "As stated in a prior post I was kicked out at 15 for being gay. From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.\n\nMy sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.\n\nThis was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as \"Family\" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.\n\nI told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.\n\nBefore we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.\n\nSo AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit. \n\nGood Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  \n\nI wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. \n\n My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  \n\nI have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. \n\nI have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.\n\nI guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly. \n\nThank you all for all your replies and support!!! ",

All my other siblings have +1s and are welcome to bring their (hetero) partners.\n\nI understand where she's coming from, but it still feels like such a slap in the face. I'm not going to try and force her to give me a +1, but I'm seriously considering not going. I love my sister, but I'm not comfortable spending a whole day alone, while my other siblings are allowed to bring their partners, just because my sister wants to cater to a bunch of bigots.\n\nI haven't said anything to anyone yet, but if I so stay home, would I be the asshole?",

        "text": "\nMy M46 daughter (16) is a highschool junior. I noticed recently that she's been behaving in a bad manner constantly commenting on other people's looks, belongings, calling them stuff that isn't cool and just being  insensitive. It's like she lost a filter or something because usually she's polite but my wife suspected that our daughter's sudden misbehavior occurred after she started hanging out with new girls from the school. Basically the mean type and have picked on their behavior. I've sat with my daughter and had many discussions about how her behavior has been negatively affecting everyone around her. Our housemaid is the person most affected here and my daughter has chosen her to be her target for hair, clothes, \"etiquette\" criticism. She has complained about our daughter calling her offensive names like filthy and gross for cleaning certain areas in our house. I took a stand and explicitly told my daughter I'd punish her if she ever said stuff like that to our housemaid again.\n\n\nLast week my daughter had a party to go to, earlier that day she called our housemaid \"filthy\" so I grounded her by not letting her go to the party. She threw a fit and called our housemaid a liar saying she never called her that. That was the end of it.\n\nDays later my daughter came to me saying she couldn't find her iPhone after looking everywhere. She asked me to call her number and I did. My wife and I were stunned to discover that the iphone was ringing inside our housemaid's bag. I had an confrontation with her immediately and she denied and cried saying she never touched the phone nor had any idea how it got there. I noticed my daughter calling her theif repeatedly so I told her to stop and go to her room. I checked the indoor camera before continuing the argument and saw my daughter place her iphone inside our housemaid's bag, I was livid. I apologized to the housemaid and gave her the rest of the day off. I then showed the video to my daughter and she was absolutely speechless. I said what she did was immoral and straight up offensive to tamper with that poor woman's livelihood over a petty party she couldn't go to. I told her she was grounded and will have to spend the night in the backyard (she is a germaphobe) but she cried begging me to not make her sleep with the dirt, insects and hot temp. I refused to discuss it or I'd make it 2 nights. My wife said I should go easy on her but I said calling people filthy and accusing them of stealing wasn't ok in fact it was the absolute worst, I then went through with my punishment. \n\n\n**The reason I chose this punishment was because of the fact that my daughter says she is a germaphobe and use this as excuse to insult others hygiene and appearance, our backyard has dirt and bugs in it and this kind of things get her uncomfortable but other than that the backyard is 100% safe**\n\n\n\n\n\n**Question/ why doesn't she clean up and do house chores as punishment instead?**.\n\n\n**because I've already tried this punishment before and it didn't work because she deliberately stopped eating for days to get out of it, and ended up in the emergency department for low blood pressure**",

        "text": "Apologies for the late update. This gained far more attention than I had anticipated and feel I owe everyone a sort of resolution to the problem. The original post here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g6l1l5/aita\\_if\\_i\\_tell\\_my\\_daughter\\_grandma\\_is\\_ashamed\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g6l1l5/aita_if_i_tell_my_daughter_grandma_is_ashamed_of/)\n\nSo my husband called his mum and dad on Facetime, while I stayed out of view to make sure he said exactly what needed to be said. He explained that her behaviour to our daughter is unacceptable and that it's not fair she is subjecting her to this sort of treatment. He explained that if it was her biological grandson receiving this sort of treatment from my mum, she would be absolutely livid and be the first to call her a racist. What she was doing was no different.\n\nHis father apologised and agreed with what he said. He tried to coax MIL to apologise but she huffed and said 'I have nothing to apologise for, that child is not ours and never will be.' My husband and FIL both argued that she was being heartless and my husband warned her if she continued to treat our daughter this way, she would not be allowed to see our baby.\n\nShe flipped. She called me a lot of racist names I won't repeat on here. She also said she would see her grandbaby whether he liked it or not, that I was a bad influence, that I was manipulating him and turning her son against him. Eventually my FIL apologised and ended the call.\n\nWe had a sit down with my daughter and explained that she couldn't see Grandma because she was in a 'time out'. My daughter asked if it was because she 'says mean things' and we both said yes. She then asked 'When she comes out of time out, can I see her again'? and I said 'absolutely, once she is out of time out you can go and visit with your new brother or sister'. She seemed satisfied with that as she then asked if she could go and play in the garden.\n\nMy husband has since been texting our FIL, but she refuses to apologise. Until she does and takes steps to improving her behaviour, she will not be allowed to visit.\n\nThank you for all your advice on the matter, we both agreed with a lot of the comments that now was not the time to bring her race up to our daughter as she doesn't see herself any different from her dad or his parents. She seems to be ok with it so far, although we are taking it day by day.\n\nEdit: I think I'm going to keep the account as, since I originally posted this a few days ago, there's been further developments which I feel I may need some advice on. Thank you for all your help x",

The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit. \n\nWe've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his \"lucky\" pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like \"oh I must've forgotten\" while laughing and then pulled out his \"other lucky pen\". I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked \"really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks?\" He was like \"it's alright you can use \"a real pen\" now\". I pushed the paper away and said \"you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed\". He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there. \n\nAt home he blew up again saying I was the one who \"delayed the process\" and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the \"damn paper\" and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed.\n\nDid I really take this too seriously?",

I feel they know I\u2019m mild-mannered, and they\u2019re taking advantage - that since I\u2019m not a tough guy or something (I\u2019m a young woman), they don\u2019t care. \n\nI\u2019m in Australia, and I\u2019m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.  \n\nWIBTA?",

It's worth mentioning that I'm the sole earner  because my fiance\u00e9 is still in University, I've saved up decent amount of money to afford the wedding.\n\n\nThing is her parents get involved in everything. From picking the engagement ring on my behalf, to giving opinions on where we should rent and now my FMIL is constantly giving opinions on our wedding. FMIL would follow up on everything we do and make negative comments on things like: the best man, the guest list, and food.\nShe told my fiance\u00e8 she didn't like who I picked to be my best man and wanted me replace him after a big argument but I said no. Though My fiance\u00e8 said we shouldve just done it.\nMIL also wanted me to un-invite people I wanted at the wedding so she could add more guests on her side of family. I said no to that also.\n\nNow the current or biggest conflict between us. MIL called saying she didn't like the venue we picked which is in our hometown. She wanted me to reconsider but I said no since my fiance\u00e9 liked it too.\nBut my fiance\u00e9 came to me yesterday to show me a venue her mom picked and already paid for saying since she paid for it then I should say yes this time. I was in shock and angry because not only did she not consult us but the venue she picked is 3 towns away where my BIL lives. I immediately thought about my disabled parents who can not travel this distance for health reasons, besides that most of my family won't attend because of distance. I said absolutely not agreeing on this venue. My fiance\u00e9 said she disagreed with me and I had no right to complain because her mom AND dad paid a lot of money for this venue as wedding gift and we should accept it. I calmly explained why I refused and she kept saying I'm refusing on purpose because \"I hate her mom\" and am playing cat & mouse with her. I bluntly said her mom is indeed making this a game and told my fiance\u00e9 she's either with me or against on this issue. She either backs me up or there won't be anymore wedding planning. She got upset and started crying asking what she's going to tell her mom and why I was making her choose between me & her parents but I just feel like she's refusing to see why I don't want this specific venue. So what of her brother lives there. I have never been to that town so having the wedding just cause her mom paid for the venue is not ok.\n\n\nWe haven't talked eversince that argument. My friend called me ungrateful fool for turning away a free wedding venue over distance but I can't help but feel FMIL did it purposely.",

        "text": "When my sister, Annie, was 18, and I was 21, she got pregnant and had a daughter, Sophie. She developed what we believe was post partum depression, but was never diagnosed as she refused therapy. When Annie's school started up again our mother took on all childcare of Sophie. As mum took on more childcare, Annie seemed more like her old self (happy, outgoing, generally mentally healthy). Then within 6 months of Sophie's birth, Annie got pregnant again with another girl, Laura, and the cycle of PPD symptoms, mum taking over, and Annie's mood improving repeated.\n\nWhen Laura was 2 and Sophie was 3, Annie decided to move out of our parent's home, *alone*, and said she wanted our parents to adopt/raise her daughters. They said no. Annie said she couldn't take care of the girls as she had her own life and being a parent made her miserable. My husband and I already had 4 kids of our own, we'd bonded with the girls, and we had the resources for 2 more, so we offered to take them in, and Annie let us legally adopt them before moving about 8 hours away.\n\nIt's been about 5 years, and the kids are doing well. It was a rough start, but we're now a stable, loving, healthy family unit. Sophie and Laura are 7 and 8, and Annie has recently lost her job and had to move back in with our parents.\n\nAnnie has now asked for \"custody\" of Sophie and Laura. I'm writing \"custody\" like that because it wouldn't be custody in the legal sense, as she willingly surrendered all legal rights to the girls and can't get them back (we checked with a lawyer). However, Annie wants the girls to live with her. Initially she said she wanted them full time and to legally adopt them back from us, which we obviously refused, then she offered a \"compromise\" of alternate weeks, so 50/50 \"custody\". Again, we refused. Given her insistence, we don't even want her around Sophie and Laura, so we've not been going by my parent's house as we typically do.\n\nIt's been a month of constant badgering, insisting we let Annie bond with \"her\" daughters, and allow her to at the very least take them for overnight visits, saying that Annie had PPD 5 years ago, and now she's ready to be a parent. I've responded that we are not babysitters, we are Sophie and Laura's parents, they're in a good place and this will be detrimental to all 6 kids, and Annie doesn't get to step in now when she never stepped up in the first place. The response from my parents and Annie is that I'm being unsympathetic to her PPD and I should let her at least have a chance, rather than deem her unfit without giving her a chance to prove herself, plus given that we already have 4 kids other than them, Sophie and Laura could probably do with a smaller household, and saying we're being unreasonable for not allowing Annie to bond with \"her\" kids.",

        "text": "My daughter (14) had anxiety problems ever since she was little but it was not severe. 3 months ago, my daughter changed drastically. She stopped eating, talking to us or her friends and her marks dropped. We were really concerned and her teachers strongly suggested we take her to therapy which we did and she was diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety which was expected.\n\nThe therapy sessions look like they helped her well, in the first month she already began making progress and started talking to us and her friends again and is eating whatever her mother is cooking. We were really happy to see this and every day she would get better and better. The thing is, her marks did not. They are terrible and she ended up barely passing the year. This is what infuriated me and made me cancel her therapy sessions. I know to some it might sound terrible, but paying $120 per session and seeing no progress in her marks makes me feel like I am seriously wasting my money (now that she returned back to normal). Not only that but since she really enjoys going to therapy I think telling her that she needs to get higher marks to continue her therapy sessions will motivate her to study harder and thus score better marks.\n\nMy wife disagrees with my logic and we had a massive argument because of it which ended up with her saying that she is going to pay from \u2018her money\u2019 which hurt me since I see my and her money as ours. My daughter is also really upset on me and was begging me to keep her therapy sessions but I think I am going to stick to this plan. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I deeply apologize for my ignorant replies and for hurting so many people. Please know that I had no intention in offending anyone and it was so upsetting to see how mental illness has affected many of you. I hope you guys can overcome this one day. I have talked to my wife and her therapy sessions will continue.",

        "text": "Sorry if some of sentences feel awkward, I am not a native speaker.\nI work from home and my job is relaxed and doesn't require me to be glued to the screen, my girlfriend works in a stressful customer service job and most of her days are terrible. In the 2 years we've been living together, I do practically all the chores around the house and I try to treat her to like a queen when she comes back home. However, the one thing I can't do is be a handyman no matter how easy the task is. A few months ago, the bathroom door hinges needed replacing so I called a friend to help.\n\nLast week during lunch with her parents, I asked her dad about the project he was working on (he does woodworking as a hobby). He showed me the progress on his phone and suggested I should help him with the last touches.\n\nMy girlfriend told him that I can't even replace door hinges let alone help with that. Her mom said that every man should know how to fix things around the house and her husband agreed with her. The remainder of lunch was very awkward, it was like they were my real parents and were disappointed of me for being a huge failure.\n\nAfter we left, I told my girlfriend that I didn't expect their reaction. Instead of taking my side, she said that they were right because it was embarrassing that I need to call a friend to help with something trivial.\n\nI reminded her that I get nervous and anxious everytime I touch a tool. I admitted it was stupid but it's just the way I am and has been very honest with her since the start. Still she didn't change her mind.\n\nI told her that since their idea of being a man is twisted I must share the same view and start working on being their version of a man. I told her that I will stop cooking for her. And I'll stop doing the dishes, laundry and cleaning. The only thing that I would keep doing is taking the trash out and grocery shopping. So I could focus my time and effort on becoming a man.",

        "text": "My husband (58 M) and I (56 F) recently met my son\u2019s (24 M) girlfriend for the first time. He\u2019s been crazy about her. Apparently they\u2019ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially. \n\nWhat he\u2019s told us about her all seems great: she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, family-oriented, etc., I\u2019m honestly just glad he\u2019s happy with her. My husband and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did. \n\nLast weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we\u2019d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is, that she\u2019s \u2018the one\u2019, in his words.\n\nThey ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth: \n\n  \u201cI\u2019m the one your son puts his penis in.\u201d \n\n  To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh (both he and my son are jokesters, and as annoying as it can be I love it) but THIS was just too much for me. Maybe I\u2019m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us THAT. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved. \n\nMaybe I let my expectations get too high, and it\u2019s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend\u2019s parents - whom she\u2019d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped. \n\nI felt like he\u2019d sold me the full package, everything he\u2019d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn\u2019t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who\u2019s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn\u2019t let up. \n\nThey left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn\u2019t responded. My husband thinks she\u2019s the one who should apologize. I\u2019m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, was I the AH?\n\nEDIT: I should clear some things up: \n\nMy husband had no part in my reaction, I did the kicking out, not him. I don\u2019t want him taking the fall for this. He said she should apologize, but I\u2019m not expecting an apology. Sorry for the confusion. \n\nMy son lives in a nearby state, it can take about an hour to get back to where we live. He also hasn\u2019t dated anyone seriously for a while, maybe a couple of years. He told us before that he wouldn\u2019t bring anyone home unless he\u2019s sure he wants a future with her. We\u2019ve been asking to meet her ever since he told us about her, but he wanted to be ready. \n\nThe comment about her looking like her picture shows my age, sorry for that! He\u2019s only shown us her photos she\u2019s sent him as he apparently didn\u2019t have any of them together (he hates taking pictures and apparently she\u2019s always teasing him about it). I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever lie about who she is, but it\u2019s just a parental concern I\u2019ve subconsciously had. I felt the same way about my daughter\u2019s (then) boyfriend when we first met him. I don\u2019t have any criteria that either of my kids\u2019 spouses need to meet, I just hope my kids are happy with them. \n\nWhat I meant by her being \u2018the full package\u2019 was indicative of what he\u2019s told us about her. As his parents we have a good idea of what he looks for in a partner and she checked off everything based on what we\u2019d been told. And on top of everything (aside from what she said) her appearance was how she presented it to be. Again, we aren\u2019t strict about appearances, it\u2019s just a relief to have met someone for the first time and they look like what you\u2019d expected. My husband said that I was worried about \u2018second-hand catfishing\u2019 if that\u2019s even a thing lol. I guess it shows how anxious I was about this.\n\nAlso thank you for your comments and rewards! I\u2019ve had a fee people reach out to me personally, too, thank you for that. Regardless of where you stand, I appreciate it. I personally think everyone needs some room for improvement here but I\u2019ve done my part to make amends and I\u2019m waiting on my son to call me! I\u2019ll be sure to give an update about how it goes.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for reaching out everyone. My son got in touch with me. His girlfriend agreed to try again. We all met at a restaurant my son and his girlfriend chose. The first thing she said was an apology for what she said. I apologized for my reaction. We hugged. It was nice. She then explained how my son had convinced her a joke like that would land well, and that she wouldn\u2019t have said it if she didn\u2019t think we\u2019d like it. According to my son, she was reluctant to open with any jokes at all, but they came up with that one together on the way over. You guys were right! \n\nShe\u2019s a really sweet girl. She\u2019s actually very mature, too. I see why my son likes her so much. My husband and I really like her, we told our son to bring her when he visits. We look forward to seeing them again. Overall, I\u2019m glad we could start over. On the right foot this time. Thanks, everyone for your input.",

She also complaint about my clothes (and underwear) a lot, because ''no married woman with a child should dress like this''.\n\nAnd see, that's what stung me because, how could she know? I suspected she was going in my drawers, but my husband told me that *she could never*, she made a comment about a cute set of lingerie that shows basically everything and I was confused, I asked how'd she knows I have it and she said ''she saw it in the washing machine'' but I prefer to wash my sets by hand so the lace last longer. Anyway, we recently changed our bedroom and I had an idea to put an end to this, when I was restocking my drawers, I used one in my vanity to put all of my husband's and mines sex toys, a few sets and a dirty letter he wrote to me once. My MIL visited us a few times and said nothing, so I did felt bad for accusing her, but yesterday she was here with my SIL and my husband and I were in the kitchen cooking for them. \n\nWe heard my MIL calling us and when we went to our room they were standing next to my open drawer, I just snorted, looked at my husband and said ''see? she snoops.'' My husband got red in the face, berated my MIL and my SIL and they both left after calling me indecent. My husband is mad at them, but he's mad at me too because he says I shouldn't have set a trap for his family and is saying we three need to apologize to each other, so maybe AITA?",

After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion.\n\nWe sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said \"I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!\". She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying \"Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing\" but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful .\n\nMy husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be \"demanding\" a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner.\n\nI genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely.

Her name is Kaia. When I returned to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, my sister offered to babysit Kaia once a week which has been incredibly helpful. \n\nNot too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fianc\u00e9 and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a \"selfish b!tch\" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written \"mother and daughter.\" I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.\n\nMy mind is an absolute mess.

She sent out invites to all our family members 4 months in advance, & almost everyone confirmed they would be going. \n\nBarely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had \u201cother commitments\u201d despite confirming they\u2019d be there months prior. \nOne of my aunts (my grandma\u2019s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren\u2019t going because they still didn\u2019t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her \u201cChristian views\u201d, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. \n\nThis upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom\u2019s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding; while my stepmom\u2019s entire family came.\n\n What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom\u2019s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom\u2019s wedding would not be invited to mine. \n\nFast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom\u2019s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. \n\nWe even invited my stepmom\u2019s family too. \n\nObviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn\u2019t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife.\n My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.  \nThat still doesn\u2019t seem to stop them from thinking it was a dick move and are turning it into a whole family drama because they think it was unfair to \u201cpunish\u201d them for simply believing in something different. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Wow thank you so much for all the love and support everyone! My wife is getting a kick out of these replies and I\u2019ll respond to some when I have the chance. Also I know some of you were confused so I wanted to clarify that I am in fact a guy",

        "text": "I am a 31 yo man and was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do. I went over to the restrooms and saw that there wasn't a family/companion restroom, just a men's and women's. I went into the men's room and saw there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn't have a counter either.\n\nI walked out and hunted down an employee to ask where the changing table was. She said it was in the bathroom, and I asked where, assuming there was a family/companion restroom on the other side of the store. She took me back to where I just was. I asked if there was another bathroom, and she said no. I told her I was just in the bathroom and there was no changing table. She asked if I was sure and suggested I look again.\n\nI was annoyed, but I went back in the men's room. No changing table. When I came out the employee was gone. Keep in mind, my son has been in his poopy diaper this whole time. So I give up and head into the lady's room which sure enough had a changing table. There was a woman in there washing her hands, and she said \"wrong bathroom, buddy.\"\n\nI gestured to my son and said \"no changing table in the men's room.\" She laughed and said \"bro, that sucks.\" Then she walked out. So I rush to change him, hoping to be done before anyone else walked in. I'm almost done when a woman walks in and starts screaming at me. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she kept screaming \"Get out! You can't be here!\" Then she ran out.\n\nI finished putting the diaper on and rushed out of the bathroom. I saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his carseat and left.\n\nMy wife said I absolutely did the right thing, but my mom said I'm an idiot and was 100% in the wrong. My sister won't stop laughing at me and is no help at all. AITA?",

        "text": "So, my life's turned into a bloody soap opera recently and I could use some outside opinions here.\n\nI (24F) am the product of my mom having an affair. Fortunately my dad decided to forgive my mom and keep me, and I had a pretty good upbringing. But I don't really look a lot like the rest of my family (I'm the only redhead, among other things) and I did ask questions of a 'why am I the only one with -insert trait here-?' nature growing up. When I was 17 my mom took me out for ice cream and introduced me to my bio-father. She said that she felt I was old enough to know the truth, and explained about her affair, while also A) making me promise I wouldn't tell my older sister (27F in the present)  and B) hammering home along with my bio-father that he'd never be part of my life and didn't want me.\n\nIt was a lot, I won't lie, but I learned to suck it up and move on with my life. Fast forward to the present. My big sis has always gravitated towards older men (we like to joke that it's the result of too many George Clooney movies growing up) and two months ago shared a picture of herself and her new boyfriend. Who, to my shock, turned out to be my bio-father. I debated what to do for a couple of days, then ultimately decided she needed the truth and told her. My sister did not take it well and dumped him, but she wasn't angry with me. Honestly by now she's kinda amused, says that since she banged my dad she's my mom and has extra power to boss me around now.\n\nMy mom on the other hand, is *furious*. She says I divulged something that wasn't my secret to share, and that I had no business telling anyone. That since bio-father isn't related to my sister it didn't matter if he dated my sister and it wasn't like they were talking marriage anyway. It's been two month and she's still angry, still snide, calls me a traitor and finds excuses to make loud comments about how I can't be trusted with anything private or important so beware.\n\nAt the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but I've never seen my mom this angry before, and she's sustained that anger for 2 solid months, so I'm starting to worry. Did I actually do something really shitty, am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow, this got a lot more comments than I expected. I can't answer everyone, but I do appreciate every comment and the support that I'm getting. Two months of having your mom furious with you takes quite a toll, so it's been really relieving seeing so many NTAs in the comments. Thank you all, I'm trying to read everyone even if I don't reply!",

I have a camera in my yard that notified me of movement near the green house so I went and checked and that's when I found a lady and young teen picking tomatoes and peppers in my green house.  I raised my voice and asked what on earth they were doing and the woman says it's fine she's friends with the owner. \n\nI asked if she wants to run that by me again cause in the owner and I don't know who the hell they are.

She's telling everyone im an asshole and a toxic  man and though most are telling her she's in the wrong, her friends on facebook are telling me I'm an asshole and should be ashamed. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdited for information: when she was offered the chance to leave without police involvement she screamed at me and broke a pot that had some chives growing. \n\nI don't have her on facebook. However my name is on my mail box and have since put my account to private.

        "text": "I (31M) have been with my wife (30F) for 10 years now and she always has had this habit of making me look bad with our finances. Whenever anything regarding spending money comes up she will always say how broke we are and she doesn't have the money to do this or buy that. The thing is we are doing well financially. We have decent jobs and combine our salary is roughly $125k/yr.\n\nAs of today our net worth is more than $1 million but less than 2. I had saved/invested a lot before getting married so I gave us a good head start. I control the finances/take the lead but we both agreed to living a very modest life. We both have our cars from college for example (Honda & Toyota). She knows everything about our finances because at least once a month I go over it with her every time I deposit money in our investment accounts or our kids college funds. For banking we have an emergency fund and I budget everything else to go straight into investments. We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.\n\nA few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. \n\nThe same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.\n\nAt a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. \n\nNow my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?\n\nEDIT: Final update for now as we have a long weekend planned. Some key points I saw a lot of and wanted to give answers.\n\n-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.\n\n-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. \n\n-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.\n\n-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. \n\n-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.\n\n-I'll speak more with my wife about this. After reading posts I think she may not feel like its her money since she never saved much before we got engaged.",

I went into my garden about 15 minutes later and my friend was standing there in my garden talking to our friends. She doesn\u2019t live that close so I was confused. \n\nI went to ask her how she got back so quickly, she told me she just popped in and was going since her dog isn\u2019t welcome. I asked her where her dog is and she shrugged her shoulders and said he was around. \n\nI went looking and found him at the bottom of the garden eating my crops and making a mess. I was angry and told my friend to get her dog off my property. \n\nA few hours later she called me asking me what her dog ate, I had no clue. My gardener plants and attends everything, I told her I didn\u2019t know, but told her he\u2019d made a huge mess, dug things up and clearly eaten things. \n\nShe shouted at me that her dog is sick and that I need to find out what the dog ate. I told her I had no idea, but I\u2019d text my gardener to ask, but it was really her problem. \n\nI did send the text, but my gardener didn\u2019t answer. My friend called again wanting to know what her dog ate, but I told her I still didn\u2019t know. She told me I obviously don\u2019t care if her dog dies and called me an AH.\n\nI still don\u2019t know what her dog ate, but apparently he is very sick and might die. I feel bad, but I told her not to bring her dog on my property so I don\u2019t feel responsible like she says I am. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - After being unable to reach my gardener I took pictures of everything the dog dug up, which was a lot and sent them to my friend, but I have no idea what it ate and what it just dug up and for all I know what it ate isn\u2019t even pictured because the whole section is a mess. This wasn\u2019t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don\u2019t even know if it can be figured out.\n\nETA 2 - My cats are house cats, they don\u2019t go in my garden and aren\u2019t at risk of getting sick from whatever my gardener is growing. My garden is huge and what is growing changes often so no I don\u2019t keep track of what is planted. \n\nUpdate - I blocked ex friend after dozens of nasty calls and texts. But I got an update from a mutual friend. The dog is at dog hospital, dog is pretty sick, but is expected to make a full recovery. I managed to contact my gardener eventually, it looks like the dog ate some potatoes or something? A lot was destroyed so even my gardener isn\u2019t 100% sure what was eaten, but he thinks maybe the pesticides were the problem. All info from gardener was passed to ex friend. \n\nEx friend has seen this post and is very angry about it. Everyone say hi to Suzanne!",

        "text": "My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn\u2019t the issue... it\u2019s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she\u2019s lying left & right. I just don\u2019t feel now is the right time for a Switch.\n\nThe theft: \n\nOn Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband\u2019s aunt & uncle\u2019s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we\u2019ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn\u2019t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.\n\nWell..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.\n\nMy kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle\u2019s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.\n\nDue to Cousin\u2019s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It\u2019s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed about the thievery, but I\u2019m even more upset over my kid\u2019s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn\u2019t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. \n\nI feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter\u2019s help from money she would \u201cearn\u201d by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.\n\nI mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don\u2019t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. \n\nAlso - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.\n\n\n\n***Edit: I\u2019ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I\u2019m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her \u201cno\u201d to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",

It blew up. It ended up on Twitter. People shared it to Facebook.\n\nThe general consensus was, yes, that I am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. A couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. More than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. \n\nWell.\n\nAfter I posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. She started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. Everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.\n\nThen one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, \"Do you seriously fucking think that I *actually like* eating at Olive Garden?\"\n\nGuys, she saw the post. She was *furious*. \n\nShe doesn't like Olive Garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. I was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, \"she never developed a taste for pasta, she's Latino, do I ever see her make pasta? No. A meal isn't complete without rice. You don't know me at all.\"\n\nShe yelled about Olive Garden for a solid twenty minutes. It wasn't just about Olive Garden, but it was a lot about Olive Garden.\n\nLong story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. She \"loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage\" from me for her own personal betterment.\n\n So, yeah.\n\nTL;DR: I ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. I didn't take her out on dates and I didn't pay enough attention. I would do anything to fix everything.\n\nEdit: To clarify a few things\n\n1. I didn't post on April First.\n\n2. I say that she yelled about \"mostly Olive Garden\" because she did. She was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over Olive Garden, where the kids are catered to.\n\n3. She did not call herself Latino. She calls herself Latinx, but I thought Latino would be less confusing. Guess it just made me look like a dick.",

She expects other adults to step in when Sofia and Parker\u2019s behavior is getting out of hand.\n\nFor this reason, I asked Angel to get a babysitter for Sofia and Parker if she wanted to attend my 27th birthday. I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. And at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday instead of dealing with Sofia and Parker\u2019s behavior, because I know Angel isn\u2019t going to discipline them herself.\n\nAngel acted understanding when I made this request and explained my reasons to her in-person, but then she went online and made a Facebook post accusing me of hating Sofia and Parker and trying to punish Angel by only inviting our sister Jessica\u2019s kid Megan to my birthday dinner. (Nevermind that Megan is 17 and is practically an adult herself.)\n\nSeveral of our relatives and mutual acquaintances called me out and said I was an asshole and was excluding a 10 and 7-year-old. I responding to Angel\u2019s post by sharing two videos of Sofia and Parker misbehaving while Angel did nothing.\n\nThe first video was a recording taken by Megan, where Sofia and Parker were throwing tantrums and yelling at her. Megan was trying to calm Sofia and Parker down while Angel was on her tablet ignoring the situation.\n\nThe other video was one that Angel took. Sofia and Parker were yelling, throwing toys at each other, and Parker even called his sister a bad word. Angel was laughing as if it were funny and was again doing nothing to discipline Sofia or Parker.\n\nI wrote alongside the videos that I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. But at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday. And I don\u2019t want to be stuck disciplining Sofia and Parker because clearly Angel won\u2019t. Angel ended up not coming to my birthday at all.\n\nMy parents told me that I was in the wrong for sharing those videos, because everyone\u2019s children have acted up and posting those videos didn\u2019t accomplish anything besides embarrassing Angel.\n\nThey also said I could have compromised by having a \u201cNobody under 18\u201d rule for my birthday dinner. Megan would not be able to attend but then Sofia and Parker wouldn\u2019t feel excluded. I do not see how that would be fair to myself or Megan. AITA For not wanting to make compromises for my birthday dinner?\n\nEdit: Hello, I wanted to clarify some common concerns about the videos. Firstly, both me and Angel's Facebooks are private, so the only people who are able to view the videos are people who either I or Angel have added as friends. A stranger will not be able to see them.\n\nAngel had already posted the video that she recorded of Sofia and Parker misbehaving, so I merely linked it. Megan had already posted the video that she recorded, just on a different social media platform. I am uncertain if Megan's social media is private, but no strangers will be able to view the videos from my and Angel's Facebook accounts.",

        "text": "My sister and her husband were sent to prison at the start of this year, and sadly won't be released for a few years. That left me to look after their 15 year old daughter Amy. I was perfectly happy to do this, but as most of their wealth was seized for being \"ill gotten\", it's meant that I've been having to care for her out of my own pocket. Once again this doesn't bother me, but it's meant massive life changes for the kid. \n\nFirstly, they sent her to a private school. I can't afford anywhere near those fees, so I had to transfer her to a local school. She was upset at this at first, but she quickly made friends and is excelling academically so this isn't a huge problem. She's been off school for the last few months anyway due to the situation.\n\nA bigger problem is clothing. Like my sister Amy loves fashion and designer stuff. She's still got a lot of stuff that her parents got her, but she's always on the lookout for new clothes. Unfortunately, I can't afford anywhere near the sort of stuff she likes, and I also have two children of my own whose clothing I have to pay for. I have told my sister this, but she insists I should \"make allowances\" because her daughter is going through a tough time. \n\nAmy also really doesn't get along with my daughter Hannah, who is 11. She bullies her, calls her stupid and ugly, tells her none of her friends really like her etc. She has made her cry on many occasions and and often continues to taunt Hannah while she cries. \n\nYesterday I caught Amy trying to buy a dress costing over a thousand with my card. I was fuming and had a long conversation with her. She cried, and sobbed that she just wanted one nice thing. \n\nMy sister called from the prison, and Amy cried over the phone that she hates here and I treat her unfairly. I spoke to my sister afterwards and she begged me to go easy on her daughter because she's \"still adjusting\". \n\nI put food on this kid's plate. I buy her whatever clothes I can afford, even if they aren't to her taste. I take her to visit her parents as much as possible (they're held in different facilities) and I do all of that on top of working and looking after my own children. \n\nI told my sister that I was willing to look after her daughter for as long as she needs, but if anything like the card incident happens again, or if she continues to pick on my daughter, there will be serious consequences for her. My sister wanted to argue but they get limited time on the prison phone. \n\nI think what I'm doing is right. I get that the kid is going through a tough time, and I'm doing everything I can to be there for her. But I can't just tolerate bad behaviour or bullying, and I can't afford to pay for her expensive clothing. The fact that she's struggling to deal with what happened to her parents doesn't change that.",

I also have a second smaller safe for keeping important documents like passports. \n\nI own my home and my boyfriend (33m) of 2 years recently moved in as he was renting before. I gave him the code to the smaller safe so he could put valuables in it, but he also wants the code for my gem safe. Not to put anything in it, but he says because we are living together now I should trust him and give him the code. I\u2019ve said no because he has no reason to open the safe as the only thing it\u2019s used for is storing my collection, he\u2019s said he has no interest in my gem collection, doesn\u2019t want to look at them, but still wants the code to access them. \n\nThis is causing tension because he says I should give it to him as a show of trust, and I said no, because he literally has no reason to go in there so he doesn\u2019t need the code. This is a 6 figure collection so I\u2019m not being difficult over a few little gems here. I am the only one who knows the code. \n\nSo Reddit am I being TA here? \n\n*also we are in the UK so we spell jewellery differently to the US\n\nEdit: holy hell this blew up way more than I ever expected! Im sticking to my guns and I\u2019m not giving him the code. All you lovely internet strangers are right, it\u2019s a huge marinara flag and I\u2019ll be telling him to pack his stuff. I\u2019ll update you later. Thank you all for your comments!!\n\nEdit 2: this keeps coming up, the safe weighs nearly half a ton, it\u2019s bolted to the floor and wall and is from a company who make safes, vaults and strong rooms for jewellers. You could bring the house down around it and it would still be intact.\n\nFinal edit: I think I have phrased it badly but all of the gems and jewellery in the safe are mine and mine alone. I do not keep any clients jewellery at home. For my other business doing valuations I rent a separate space and keep client items there. \n\nI will give an update once things have panned out\n\nAnother edit: I\u2019ve checked for cameras (thank you for the suggestions people) and there aren\u2019t any aside from the ones I already have fitted which he doesn\u2019t have access to. I\u2019ve moved all of my personal docs out of the little safe and into my gem safe. I\u2019ve told my colleague what I\u2019m doing and she is going to come around for when I do it. \n\nUpdate: \n\nFirstly thank you so much for the insane amount of comments and support, it meant so much to me.  For all of your messages and questions I\u2019m really sorry if I didn\u2019t get to you there were just so many! \n\nI probably didn\u2019t emphasise in my last post that we had a couple of conversations about this and me explaining why he had no reason to go in there etc. \n\nShort version is I told him he isn\u2019t getting the code and I will die on this hill. He has no reason to have it and his continued lack of respect by the pushing of my boundaries wasn\u2019t ok, I felt like he was trying to manipulate me by making it about trust.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth he finally admitted that he wanted access to the safe because he didn\u2019t feel like I was sharing the whole house with him, because I insisted on a tenancy agreement rather than just letting him move in, and he didn\u2019t like that part of where he lived was off limits to him. He was also insecure and resented that  I have more money than him and own a home whilst he doesn\u2019t, he had made a few comments about this before but I didn\u2019t realise it was such a big issue for him. He also said that by keeping him out of the safe made him feel like I thought he was lesser than me and that it made him feel like I was treating him like a child. \n\nI told him if that\u2019s how he feels then this is not the right relationship for either of us and that it was best we break up. He was shocked that I was ending things over this, cried and asked me to reconsider, when I said no he then got angry, called me a stuck up b*tch said he was better off without me anyway and went to his friends. I told him via text he had 30 days before he had to leave (as per the tenancy agreement) so he didn\u2019t need to stay at a friends, he said he would be gone by the end of the week. 2 days later he came back and packed up all of his stuff and left, he\u2019s staying with his friend now. \n\nI have changed all the locks, I have an alarm and cctv system that\u2019s professionally monitored and I have changed the verbal password I have to give when you call up as a precaution. I\u2019ve checked all of my collection and it hasn\u2019t been touched. I also took your guys advice and am giving my solicitor the code and safe deposit details to be passed to my executor in the event of my death. \n\nI feel horrible because despite all of this I love him, but lot\u2019s of the comments said how I should have a partner who not only respects my boundaries but takes an interest in my passions and that really got to me because it\u2019s true, so may of you reached out with questions and it made me so happy, but also sad as he never asked me stuff like that, I think this is what pushed me over the edge to end it more than anything. \n\nI\u2019m pretty cut up right now and missing him, but I know I\u2019ll be ok, I have great friends and family around me, also diamonds are a girls best friend and I have a few knocking around to help cheer me up!",

        "text": "I've \"lost\" my job and have been ostracized by my family, so I figured I'd come to the court of public opinion.\n\nOne of my best friends of over ten years lost her battle with the big C word on Christmas. Fuck cancer, y'all. I'm not handling it well, tbh. I feel like a really crazy person. I literally haven't stopped crying. \n\nThrough all the tumultuous emotions, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. \n\nI don't know why, but I felt like I wanted to get rid of a psychological weight and my hair was suffocating me.\n\n I 'model' and I've been doing it pretty much my whole life. My family is upper middle class due to my income. My parents 'work' as my mangers, even though I had actual, hired, experienced managers throughout the years. My dad works part time elsewhere, but I am the main breadwinner in the family. \n\nPart of my current contract was that I can't cut my hair without prior consent from managing parties or else my contract could be rendered void. It wasn't really an issue until now.\n\nFor a week, I tried to get consent, but nobody wanted to give it. So, over the weekend, I locked myself in my bathroom and chopped off almost all of my hair. I didn't go as extreme as 2007 Brittany, but I was definitely channeling her energy. \n\nNow I look like Steve from Stranger Things. \n\nI don't feel a lot better, but it was kind of cathartic. I'm glad I did it. My life changed, and I physically reflect that now.\n\nNow I'm unemployed, though, cause I was released from my contract and as soon as I'm done with high school, my family wants me gone.\n\nI know that I jeopardized my family's financial security, and my parents are scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills because I may have been an immature asshole, but, I dunno, maybe it's grief, but I feel pretty apathetic about it. I wanted to grieve in my own way.\n\nAm I the asshole for that?\n\nUPDATE: 6.35PM\n\nSo I talked to a few folks today, and I was sent a copy of the email exchanges that ultimately ended my contract. \n\nMy contract was set to expire in June, but I wasn't booking until May to give myself time to finish up my last semester in high school. Instead of terminating my contract or 'firing me', i was released from my contract in a really nice way. \n\nI won't copy/paste, but the gist is;\n\nHere at Company we value the health and safety of all our employees and it seems that Brittany is going through a hard time. Let's release her from her responsibility so she can enjoy school, and should she decide to come back after high school or freshman year of college, she'll be welcomed back into the agency.\n\nThey even sent a .pdf of therapists or counselors that I might wanna talk to. \n\nI talked to my old manager and she set me up in contact with a lawyer and already has access to copies of my documents, which she sent me in .pdf, too. I also contacted Jasmine's mom, who said that I can move in to finish hs if I'm kicked out in March. \n\nI'm not gunna say much, but what my parents were doing was definitely illegal unless I have trusts, which I doubt bc my parents both have nice new cars and stuff.\n\nI also emailed my school guidance counselor. \n\nI have a new email contact, and I'll be sent my financial records ASAP. \n\nSo... yeah. Posting this morning, I honestly felt like an ungrateful, whiny teen who fucked over her family, but you guys made me realize that my life is *definitely* not normal or fair, and I thank you all for that, and for the immeasurably kind words you've all given me.\n\nI'll keep fighting!\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot and somehow blocked someone while scrolling  in my inbox.",

        "text": "\nI'll be quick, my f26 fiance m32 is blind. We don't disagree a lot except, he always gets bothered whenever I eat different food from what he's eating when we go out. Like, if we're having dinner out and I order else, he'd instantly get upset and accuse me of treating him as less than when I just have different taste in foods.I'd just eat what he eats to keep the peace (I eat out alone as alternative) but since he clearly doesn't trust me, he'd randomly touch my plate to see if I'm having the same dish. This caused huge arguments between us and I told him to stop doing it and he said he would.\n\n\n\nWe went out to eat nights ago, and I ordered the same dish he ordered. When the food arrived, he looked somewhat uncomfortable. I asked what was wrong and he refused to say, and before I could even grab the fork he extended his arm and his hand touched the food on my plate. He moved quickly and started excussing what he did saying he \"just wanted to make sure...\" but I lost it on him, I felt so grossed out and there was no way I could eat the food after he touched it. He tried to get me to drop it saying i shouldn't be grossed out by his hand, and that I overreacted etc... but I grabbed his plate and told him that I was taking it as my donner. He at first asked meto be \"rational\" and give the plate back but I refused. An argument ensued and we had a fight. He then ended up leaving started spam texting me accusing me of being bitter, pathetic and childish, and robbing his dinner. He went to stay with his friend who picked him up and his friend sided with him saying I was in the wrong. Even went as far as to say that I was abusing my fiance and financially controlling him when I pointed out that I was the one who paid for the food.\n\n\nThe problem is magnified now with him wanting an apology and me refusing to give him one. My parents think I should have more patience and that this is just typical \"love spats\" between us but I'm not sure.\n\n\nWas I the ah with how I handled this?\n\n\nEDIT I want to point out that this is not the case when we ate at home, he has no issue with me eating different food. But in public it's a different story.",

He then said he doesn't feel comfortable with me sleeping in bed wearing pads. this threw me off hard because I wasn't expecting him to have an issue on that regard, but he said it just doesn't feel comfortable *for him* and he would like me to use tampons at nighttime or sleep somewhere else. I laughed him off and kept sleeping on the bed while wearing my pads like there was no issue. This made him so uncomfortable he basically took the couch then started complaining about how I forced him on the couch by making him uncomfortable after he already offered me compromises. but I told him he was being a drama queen because his compromises are illogical, I wouldn't stop using pads and free bleed on the bed nor risk my health and use tampons when the doctor advised again them. he's still upset with me even though I'm no longer on my period saying I owe him for making him uncomfortable and brushing off his complaints.",

She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.\n\nMy issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).\n\nI asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.\n\nSince then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?\n\nEdit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked??\n\nEdit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me\n\nEdit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone\n\nFinal edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.\n\nAlso, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

Life got in the way.  \n\nIt started fine, but quickly went south and ended in a big fight that degenerated into a lot of petty shit-slinging by the end.  She accused me of not trusting her (fair) and I pointed out that her habits make it basically impossible to trust her with money anyway...probably not my proudest moment.  But, I did again make it clear in no uncertain terms that the properties are staying in the LLC and I won't sell them, and that the financial decisions regarding them would be mine alone.  I may have also had a few choice words about the princess-for-a-day wedding she wanted.  \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of avoiding each other, and not talking, and me sleeping in the basement of the townhouse, I said I wanted to hit the pause button and leave for a while.  She was upset but didn't say much.  I loaded up my things and went to my parents' house and told them what happened.  They told me I could stay as long as I needed.  \n\nSomewhere near the end of April, I got a call from her dad out of the blue (what the hell) demanding to know what was going on and why I'd broken things off.  I tried to explain what had been going on but he was the angry dad of an upset young woman and i don't think much got through.  That call ended with him calling me a scumbag and hanging up on me.  I've only had a few properly long-term relationships end in my lifetime, but that's the first time I've had an angry father yell at me about one.  \n\nThere's been no contact since.  I'm sad that just over four years of my life with someone went up in smoke like this, but that's the way she goes I guess.  My parents didn't seem very surprised when I showed up, so maybe I really was the last one to know what was going on, like so many redditors were pointing out.  \n\nFor some good news, and also the thing that reminded me to update my reddit post, is that yesterday I bought another house, one for me to live in.  A tiny little brick postwar brick ranch in an old subdivision about 20 minutes from my rentals.   It needs work but I'm looking forward to having a prjoect to take my mind off things.  It's going to be strange living on my own again, but I think I'll manage.",

First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was \"real\" or just 'lenses\", also asked about how I spend my time when \"alone\" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying \"keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!\". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an \"attitude\". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.\n\nI went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I \"ruined\" it for myself and cost him his job.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "\nI want to start by saying that I F25 don't have the best relationship with my mom. I have an older sister and growing up my mom always tended to control me and tried to override any decisions I make saying that I was young and naive and she always knew better. I cut contact with her for a few months after she tried to get involved in my marriage. My husband and I been together for 3 years and he has always been telling me to be more gentle with my mom.\n\nI had a miscarriage a few days ago. It's devastating and I really thought it'll get easier but I'm still feeling excruciating pain and frustration. We were happy and excited but all that disappeared suddenly and it was hard for me to take because I thought everything was fine. I didn't tell anyone especially since I'm currently dealing with some health issues.\nI didn't tell anyone in the family. My husband promised not to tell until I'm ready. My mom kept asking me questions and brought up my pregnancy constantly and my answers were short. Because I didn't want her to know since she'd call everybody and let them know. She's always like this that's why I tend to keep things private\n\nI decided to not visit for a couple of days hoping she'd stop asking questions. Then I found out on FB that my mom announced my miscarriage on her page and I didn't know about that I was shocked I freaked out when I started getting calls from family members and I have no idea how many people knew about it. I was so mad to the point of shaking. Everyone kept berating me for not telling them.\nI called my mom and I yelled at her. she defended herself saying that she was just looking for support and that I should've told her about it first time she asked what was wrong. I asked her who told her and she said she had a talk with my doctor but I shouldn't be mad because she's my mom and she had the right to know what's going on. I argued with her about getting involved in my personal life and disregarding my feelings and cutting me off guard like that.\n\nI went to the doctor and I lashed out at her for releasing my private medical information to my mom and causing me to deal with everyone asking why I was hiding my miscarriage from them even though I was just waiting for the right time. I told my doctor that I was going to file a complaint against her the same day since she didn't respect my privacy and decided to give my mom information about my medical records.\n\nMy mom heard and started berating me saying it wasn't the doctor's fault and that she was a friend of hers she knew year's ago but I didn't know about it. She said that I went too far and acted like my family were strangers. She said that she's my mom and I didn't need to overreact like that. All I needed was time and space now I have to deal with all this stress and I'm a mess right now.\n\n* My brother texted me a few minutes ago and said he wants to come over and talk to me. He was the first to call me and berated me and said that I was being hostile towards everyone for no reason. I haven't replied to his text yet but I don't want to see anyone right now. I can't take one more word from them.",

        "text": "So recently I found out my son \"Jacob\" (15) pulled an incredibly cruel \"prank\" on one of the girls I'll call \"Ashley\" that's in his friend group. I know this girl, she's been to our house and even attended Jacob's birthday party a month ago. She seemed incredibly sweet if not a bit shy. So when my oldest son \"Mark\" (17) came to me and told me Jacob had asked Ashley out on a date as a prank I was stunned.\n\nI of course asked how he could know this, hoping as any mother would that it wasn't true. But Mark showed me the family tablet we all use (but mostly my sons do) and it seems Jacob forgot to log out of his chatting app, discord. I read the long series of messages between Jacob and his friends as they mocked Ashley all through this heartless prank. I was speechless. And that's not even getting into HOW he was talking, like he was some thug and not a 15 year old living in a gated community.\n\nAt first I couldn't figure out what to do, or how to proceed. I'll admit that I never once imagined either of my boys would be the type of person to do something like that. But there was no way in hell I was letting this go. So after a day of thought I decided what was going to happen. First things first, he was grounded, for how long I'm not sure. Secondly, I'd gotten Jacob a bike for his birthday but it hadn't arrived until the day previous and I'd planned to give it to him when my parents came to visit since they'd been unable to make his party.\n\nBut instead of that I showed him I knew about the \"prank\" and told him he was grounded, then I made him carry the new bike out of my bedroom closet and to the car before driving to Ashley's house, him crying the whole way. I'd called her parents earlier and explained everything and so once we got there I had him cart it to their front porch and ring the bell. Then in front of me, Ashley, her parents, and God I had him give a sincere apology and gift her the bike. Even I apologized to her, saying I didn't raise my boy this way and what he did was unforgivable. I also called the parents of the other boys who were apart of this little stunt and they all seemed rightfully horrified by their sons' involvement.\n\nI felt I'd handled this all as best as I could, and my friends agreed. Though once my parents found out that I'd made Jacob give his birthday gift away they said what I did went too far. I still feel like what I did was right but having my parents more or less dog pile on me like this actually made me wonder if how I handled it was too extreme? AITA here?",

His best friend is getting married next year, and my bf is one of his groomsmen so we\u2019ve been spending more time with his friend group lately. \n\nI\u2019m admittedly not super keen on one of his friends (S) but I\u2019ve always just chalked it up to personality differences. She\u2019s quite loud and dominates conversation a lot, but it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like her, I just find her a bit much. \n\nWe were in a zoom with bfs friends, shooting shit and the wedding came up. At one point we were talking about outfits etc and S said how much she hates shopping and was dreading going shopping. She made a weird comment about how she\u2019s so not girly and \u2018one of the guys\u2019 which I found immature, she\u2019s a grown woman after all, but I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nS asked if I knew what I was wearing and I said no, but I had planned to go shopping with a friend of mine who also had an event coming up. I was going to ask S if she\u2019d like to come with us, but she interrupted saying \u2018Oh, that\u2019s so cute! I just don\u2019t like stuff like that, I don\u2019t hang out with other girls, I just prefer being with the guys.\u2019 Which I found really patronising to be honest. It was clear I was annoyed, and the conversation kind of took a turn.\n\nMe: So you have never had a friendship with another woman before?\n\nS: No I have, I just find a lot of girls petty and catty, don\u2019t you?\n\nMe: No I don\u2019t. I\u2019m friends with lots of women, we compliment each other, go shopping together and occasionally share pastries sometimes.\n\nS: Oh I could never, girls always talk behind my back!\n\nMe: You know, if every single relationship you\u2019ve ever had with another woman has gone sour, there\u2019s a common denominator there, and it\u2019s not the fact that they\u2019re other women, it\u2019s probably you. \n\nA couple others laughed, and tried to move onto a different topic of conversation, but it was clear S was angry. She logged off early and later texted my boyfriend and said I was way out of line. He replied and told her he didn\u2019t think so, and if she was one of the guys she should be used to a bit of gentle ribbing every now and then. \n\nI feel a bit bad because all though I felt hurt by her comments, she seems quite insecure to me, plus it\u2019s not really my friendship group so I may have been a bit over bearing.

Except for my family. I have 3 sisters all with kids from 2-10. My mom said it was illogical to not allow kids since (1 this never happened in the family and (2 my sisters live towns away so the kids can't be left alone. After a lot of arguing and others getting involved. I stood my ground and they agreed to not bring kids.\n\nAt the wedding no one brought kids. My parents and aunts were already there. But then I saw my 2 sisters arriving with their kids. I immediately went to ask what's the deal. They began arguing with me when I said I won't be letting them in with the kids. I saw My older sister came with her kids in the car I was pissed I asked why they decided to go against the rule and bring kids. My mom started yelling at me when I told my sisters they weren't allowed in with the kids. Everyone was yelling at me I had to get the security involved to make them leave. My parents and aunt left shortly after.\n\nThey were so pissed at me. I got nasty texts later and my cousin posted about my \"shitty wedding\" on fb.\n\nDays later. I've gathered the family and explained that what they did was wrong. I asked If I allowed my sisters with their kids what message does that send to my inlaws and friends who wanted to bring kids but they couldn't? My sisters argued with me and it turned out my mom told them to bring their kids and she'd deal with me later. I told them they could've arranged for a babysitter but my mom said they wanted to celebrate as a whole family. Said that I ruined my own wedding by making a scene. And everyone will always remember my wedding as a disaster, a shitshow because of mine and my wife's child-free bull. They said the only way to fix it is to have another wedding/party and include everyone especially kids- I called them unreasonable. I asked mom where TF she got the nerve to even demand that?. They blamed my wife and claimed it was deliberate.\n\nI left. They started talking to my wife trying to convince her that they don't approve of what happened and that they're giving us the chance to fix the situation otherwise the relationship is damaged. This caused me a headache and I don't think what I did was wrong. I just wanted them to have some respect for my wife and her family.",

That being said, if someone speaks to me I will happily speak to them.\n\nCue to the incident, a OAP came up to me while I was taking stuff to my car and she started asking questions. The usual stuff you ask new neighbours but then she asked me when I planned on moving which I thought was quite unusual. I told her I had no plans to move yet and then she went on to talk about how young people have started moving into the street and it is much so noisy, especially those with families (She knew I have kids but they barely spend any time outside) and how she wished it went back to a street of old people.\n\nFor about 10 minutes there was nothing but low key insults about young people. I couldn't really excuse myself as I had stuff to do with my car that was time sensitive.\n\nSo in the end I just said\n\n\"You can't expect only old people to live in a street, eventually they grow old and die. Maybe wait a few years and we'll be old and you'll have your street back if you're still around.\"\n\nShe looked at me as if I just murdered her family and walked off. In the heat of the moment I felt justified but thinking back on it, I pretty much told her she will be dead soon which no one really likes hearing. She just wouldn't stop talking about the good old times.",

I: don't worry, I spend it on him or put it in his saving account; R: no, i want to give him money myself; I: *surprised pikachu face* that's not the best idea, he will eat it or something; R: but that's his money and i want him to have it. At this point I'm just tired of this fruitless conversation and said sure, go ahead. And then i watched my son grabbing this money, rotate it in his little hands and tear it to pieces in like 3 sec. Relative called me names because \"I knew it's gonna happen\" and i obviously knew so i couldn't denied. But really is it that shocking, he's 1 for fuck sake and I told her to not give him this money\n\n(On mobile and not native speaker, of course it wasn't 200$ but equivalent in my currency)",

        "text": "7 years ago I was married and expecting a baby when things went horribly wrong. Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. \n\nPretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.\n\nI met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.\n\nAround three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.\n\nMy parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "My (18M) parents planned on being a child free couple, but because of religious beliefs they kept me even if I was an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nI don't remember when exactly I was told, but I always knew that I would be expected to move out as soon as I reached 18 years old. I have been working and saving since I turned 13 and have a respectable ammount in a savings account.\n\nNow to be fair to my parents, they provided for me financially, they were distant emotionally but they have never been abusive.\n\nA week before my 18th birthday (January 13th) they sat me down and asked if I have found a place to move into yet. I said yes and that was the extent of the conversation.\n\nI was planning to live in an apartment with 4 other guys, but a friend's family heard about it and offered me their finished basement with separate access for a very cheap price ($150 a month utilities included, no down payment required). So I jumped at the opportunity even though I know it is a pity offer. It is relevant that both his family and mine are of Indian descent.\n\nI moved out the day after my birthday and my parents haven't contacted me since. I admit that I did not reach out to them too.\n\nYesterday my dad called to invite me to dinner. It was awkward even before they asked me to move back in, said I don't have to pay them rent or anything. But here's the thing, I like my new living situation, it lacks the awkwardness and tension that I didn't even know was there untill I moved out.\n\nWhen I said no, politely at that and thanking them for the offer, my mother started crying and left the room, while my dad started scolding me and saying that their friends are excluding them because of the \"rumour\" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.\n\nI said that that was exactly what happened, and it isn't my job to save them from the consequences of their actions and decisions.\n\nNow my whole extended family is calling me nonstop and saying I am being an AH.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: first I want to thank you all for the kind comments and well wishes, I was hesitating for a moment there and you all made me feel so much better about my decision. I read every comment and appreciate every award. Didn't think this post would explode like this but I am happy because of all the nice comments.\n\nTo answer a question that was asked by a lot of my fellow desi Redditors: I think my parents thought that I would be moving with strangers and they could say that I was trying to be independent and they were supportive of that. But when I moved with people from the community they couldn't pretend anymore.\n\nAlso I think the aunty and uncle I live with are the ones who told people about the situation, they are extremely nice and were very upset about what my parents did. They have offered me to live with them as long as I wish and were not even going to accept any rent except I insisted.",

        "text": "I f25 am getting married to my fiance \"Kevin\" next month. My family love Kevin and Kevin loves them. However, my mom is the \"brutally honest\" type who constantly dish out her opinions and thought on what people wear, how they look, how well off they are... Mostly negative, tasteless, backhanded comments. She says she can't help it and that no one should be offended when she's just being honest.\n\n\nWhen she met Kevin, she kept making comments about him, his car, his degree etc. With time and strict conversations I was able to get her to show some respect. But she kept annoying Kevin by constantly talking about his hairless face (his face is clean he doesn't have a beard or mustache which he can be very insecure about, he comes from Irish origins so he's white, he has no facial hair while I'm hispanic) mom made jokes with her husband about how \"unmanly\" it is to not be able to grow a beard or a mustache. Those comments hurt Kevin so much. I had as very very stern conversation with her and she said \"oh I didn't realize those remarks were offending him I was just teasing him\" or \"you know me I'm just giving my humble, honest opinion so he shouldn't take it personal and should learn that this is how I am\". She ended up sincerely apologizing to Kevin and we left it at that.\n\nAs the wedding is approaching. Mom decided to give Kevin a wedding gift and also to let him know how sorry she was for her past behavior. She invited the whole family for dinner and decided it was the perfect time to hand Kevin his wedding gift. He thanked her but she insisted that he open it right there and then and show everyone what she got him since she knew him that well already. He opened the box and found a set of shaving tools with a shaving cream. Kevin stopped for a sec and kept staring at the gift. My stepdad took it and showed everyone then mom and others started laughing while stepdad kept saying \" you get the joke Kev? You get it?\". And my brother running around the table laughing with everyone. Kevin got up and walked out. I was so mad I lost it on mom asking why she did that and humiliated Kevin infront of everyone. She told me to relax she was just messing with him but I said she knew how he felt about this topic and demanded she apologize but she said no since she wasn't responsible for his reaction and thought he was going to laugh along. I angrily said \" no apology, no wedding invitation, period\" then walked out. She freaked out calling try to say we overreacted to a joke and my brother said I was crazy to exclude mom from my wedding over something so stupid. he said Kevin should get over it since it was a joke but I refused to send an invitation and withheld until/unless she apologizes. They think I'm unreasonable choosing this to be my hill to die on and called me disrespectful for how I treated my mom.\n\n* I'd like to point out that my brother and stepdad and uncle sometimes take part in teasing Kevin. My brother (who's 31 years old) would sometimes either brag about his goatee mustache infront of Kevin or tell an indirect silly joke about this topic wich would irritate Kevin and just spoil any family gathering we have. But mom is the one who started this whole campaigne and I've already had conversations with her about it.\n\n* Kevin is American but has Irish origins.",

When we first got together they were both still in her bed, they were both relatively small and I worked nights. It was never an issue. Last year I suffered a work injury and now have to sleep on a memory foam mattress. \n\nI assumed by now both kids would of grown out of cosleeping, but obviously havent. I cant comfortably sleep in a bed with two kids, especially because my stepson (nine) is a little ninja. He is constantly kicking during the night.\n\nThey will occasionally sleep in their own beds, but very rarely. My stepdaughter is a little better, but stepson will have meltdowns if we try and send him to his own bed. \n\nMy wife doesnt believe we should force them out, which I understand, but I cant keep sleeping on the couch when they're in the bed. \n\nA couple days ago I blew up over it. My backs killing, I'm tired. \n\nI essentially told her to take the kids and sleep in one of their beds, I need the comfortable mattress for my back. We never really got to discuss it because stepson got upset and started crying. That night she took the kids to her parents for the night, and back at home she explained that they wouldnt all fit in one of the kids beds. \n\nShe agreed that I could have the big bed, but is ordering a memory foam mattress for our sons bed so I can sleep there comfortably. I dont want to sleep in a kids bed; I want my bed, and I'd like to actually spend a night with my wife. \n\nHer parents are on her and the kids side, obviously, but I still dont think I should have to give my bed up for them, in the nicest way possible. I paid for it. \n\nThe issue is getting worse, and my in laws are now calling me abusive for trying to take their comforts. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nImportant info; both kids and my wife are asd diagnosed, stepson also has adhd.",

        "text": "My brother and I do not get on.\n\nWhen we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.\n\nThere was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.\n\nYou really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.\n\nI have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?\n\nAnyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.\n\nYesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.\n\nI just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.\n\nI received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just \"been a man\" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to think\n\nEDIT\n\nI just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  \n\nA lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.\n\nThe rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.\n\nI think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.\n\nSorry I can't reply to all your comments but I've been trying to read them all. Thanks again Reddit.",

He kind of brushed me off and I told him if he pulled anything like that again he was gone. \n\nThe next week the ball came into our garden and I was about to throw it back to the kids when my boyfriend stormed outside and took the ball inside. I told the kids that I would bring it back in a minute. He went into the bathroom and emerged like 10 minutes later wearing gloves and a football covered in shit. HIS OWN SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nI asked him if he was out of his fucking mind but he stormed past me and threw it over the fence screaming \"TAKE THAT YOU BITCHES\". I screamed and girl I mean screamed at him about how he was a fucking douche and I wanted him out of my house and he is a disgusting fucking monster and that they were just kids. I screamed and screamed and eventually he left.\n\nI deleted all his games off of his ps4 and gave it to the kids as an apology. I was so embarrassed.\n\nMy ex-bf's mom messaged me asking what happened and I responded with\n\n\"What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? You are a pathetic excuse of a woman who raised a fucking sociopath who covered a football in his own shit and threw it at some kids and he needs to be a in a facility because something is wrong with him and god knows how I hadn't seen any red flags about the fucking monster you raised during the 7 months we dated\".\n\nI know I am in the right for what I did to my bf but am I in the wrong for snapping at the mother for something she had no direct involvement in?",

It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.\n\nI warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.\n\nOne friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. \n\nRoughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.\n\nAITA for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?",

        "text": "Wow. I have never felt so supported and loved in a very long time. I wasn\u2019t even going to post anything but I\u2019m so happy I did. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain just how big of an impact everyone\u2019s comments and dms had on me. It was so lovely. Thank you so much for all the offers of friendship, and more. \n\nSo as of a few weeks ago, I moved in with my father. Being alone with my son had me going crazy. The loneliness was literally killing me. I needed help and I am no longer ashamed to admit it. My dad made the offer.\n\nI work Mon-Fri and have the weekends off and well I\u2019ve been following everyone\u2019s advice and signed up for a mommy and me thing nearby. It was nerve wrecking but so many moms were so friendly and came up to me themselves. I got three numbers and they\u2019re all inviting me to a dinner party. They\u2019re really sweet despite being at least 5 years older than me. They\u2019ve sort of adopted me lol (their words not mine).\n\nI\u2019m also going for walks after work. My dad and son come along sometimes. Me and my dad also cook together and we make some pretty neat stuff for his girlfriend who has also been really kind. \n\nAs for my mother and sisters, I still don\u2019t know why they dislike me and my baby so much. But I took that step and left the GC. This might sound ridiculous but it was really hard. I even shed a tear. But I did it. They haven\u2019t spoken to me since.\n\nI contacted my in laws one last time. Idk why but his parents said they were willing to meet. They won\u2019t try and take him from me but my dad got me a lawyer just in case. I\u2019m meeting them this weekend and depending on how it goes, I will let them see my son eventually. \n\nFinally, I saw a doctor and I\u2019ve been diagnosed with PPD. I\u2019m currently seeing a therapist that was recommended to me and have started a treatment plan. My son, father and his gf have been my biggest supporters and I\u2018m trying to be better for me but them as well. I\u2019ve also been missing my fianc\u00e9 a lot these days but his memory is kind of calming. Idk.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been very long but I\u2019m already seeing improvements in my life. It\u2019s crazy how making my original post kickstarted this change. Thank you so very much for everything.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you so so so much for all the nice comments and messages. I\u2019m trying to read them all but there\u2019s too many and I cannot keep up haha. I\u2019ve shed a few tears as well.\n\nThe meeting with my in laws went well and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother cried a lot and said she was so sorry. I didn\u2019t give too many details but I did show them pictures of my son. They still won\u2019t be meeting him till a lot later and without me but it\u2019s progress. Also I call my fianc\u00e9 my bf and fianc\u00e9 because well he passed away a week before proposing to me. I found the ring and his friends told me. So although he was never \u201cofficially\u201d my fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s just comforting. And I call my in laws my in laws because it helps with the word count. \n\nBut yeah, thanks again :)",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TAH here but one of my coworkers does and we both follow this reddit, so we\u2019re letting reddit decide. \n\nI (28F) was named after a really obscure character from Greek Mythology. My preferred nickname is taken from the end of my name. I always introduce myself with \u201cI\u2019m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).\u201d None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that \u201cBessie\u201d (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn\u2019t like that nickname and wouldn\u2019t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.\n\nFor the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say \u201chey Bessie\u201d I would reply \u201cyou have the wrong number there\u2019s no Bessie here\u201d and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren\u2019t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.\n\nFriday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He\u2019d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he\u2019d write her up and dock her pay. \n\nLater, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said \u201cI warned you.\u201d Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I\u2019m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn\u2019t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge.

I found this bizzare but I politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. My husband agreed but I said no. This initiated an argument between her and I.\u00a0During the argument I pointed put how I didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying \"Don't you just stand there! Say something!\". My husband told me to let her it's just one night, but I told her those were all the options I had for her and if she didn't like them then I could book her in a hotel. She took it as in I was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. \n\nShe left at 12am and my husband blew up saying I disrespected his mom who was a GUEST at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and I acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. The next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards MIL abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how I keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away. \n\nBut I want to know if I was really ta?",

He asked if I was serious to consider leaving our 2 year old with a babysitter and suggested that I do what I normally do and stay home with the kids while he goes to the wedding. I refused and said I have as much right to attend as him since we both were invited. He said it wasn't his fault my brother wants a child free wedding and I should do this for the kids and sarifice for their sake. I still refused and said this was unfair and since he's a parent too then he should also stay for the kids.\n\n\nHe looked at me and said \"That's my best friend's wedding you're asking me to skip for Christ's sake, are you kidding me?\". Then said I was being petty for suggesting this and that I was basically choosing to go and party over keeping our kids safe. He asked me to consider this a business trip what would I do? Go with him and leave the kids?....\nI said I understand his paranoia of babysitters but really all my friends have sitters and at times they're really needed. He said I ought to know better than what my friends tell me and this wasn't even up for discussion and when I kept arguing he called me selfish and said he won't let me ruin his relationship with his friend because I was being spiteful for not being able to attend and that my brother'll understand my situation.\n\n\nHe keeps asking who's more important\u00a0 a wedding party or my kids and said I was unreasonable for making my attandance the hill to die on.\n\n\nAita?

I tried to do my best for him and he got into a good engineering school but at 19, he got his then girlfriend Iza pregnant and they had Annabella together. I've been the one who has mostly raised her (Iza got deported but they spend July together and FT every night). Julius got married to his girlfriend Katja after graduation and they have two wonderful boys together. Annabella lives with me and not with them.\n\nThe thing is, Julius never spends any time with Annabella. He doesn't even call to say goodnight. But she loves him so much. It's like once a month, he'll show up with a box full of toys, spend a day with her and then go back to his family. It hurts her so much that he doesn't spend time with her because he's her hero. I'm just grandma. And no, he doesn't act this way because of his wife. Katja would love to have Annabella move in with them, she once brought up the idea and she went on about all the things they could do together. She would love to be her stepmom, calls her princess, sweetie and so many nice nicknames. The only reason they haven't is because Julius has said she should stay with me.\n\nA few days ago, Julius told me that he and Katja were planning a trip to Disneyland in August. I told him that Annabella would be so excited and he should tell her on her birthday and he just blankly told me she's not coming and the trip is for his boys. I made it clear to him that he needed to bring her on the trip and he just called me an asshole - which he's never done before - for trying to control him. I admit that I was a bit controlling in my reaction but I don't think I went that far.",

        "text": "Update at the bottom. \n\nThrowaway. Ok I know the title is confusing but hear me out. I went out to eat with my (34f) bf (35m) and a two other couples. For context I am a mother to a 5yr old (not my bf child). So two tables away was a new parent couple & what I can only assume was the guys parents. I assumed this because I was that girl when I first had my child. Out to dinner with your fathers child and his family and baby is being fussy- you\u2019re struggling and no one is helping you. Baby\u2019s crying for about 15 min now all while the father or no one else for that matter is offering her any help or a break so she can have at least a bite of her food that\u2019s been sitting there cold for about 30 min. I really just wanted to run to her grab the baby for a bit and tell her to eat. \n\nThis is where I might I have been an asshole:baby\u2019s crying (again no one paying attention) and she goes to comfort baby and breastfeed. Well ALL of a sudden she\u2019s the center of attention! Baby father says what are you doing? That\u2019s disgusting go to a stall in the bathroom! At this point I lost it. My bf was trying to calm me down the entire time telling me it\u2019s none of my business but I just went ham. I got up from my table walked over and told him if he found it so disgusting why doesn\u2019t he go eat his sandwich on the the toilet. I said she has been struggling, hasn\u2019t had a bite to eat all while the 3 of you sit there enjoying yourselves and letting her drown.\nAnd then I said loud enough that the tables around could hear that anyone who is offended by a woman breastfeeding needs to get checked because breasts weren\u2019t made for men to suck on for pleasure they were made for feeding and that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing. \nNo one said anything but she also didn\u2019t go to the bathroom and finished feeding her baby who calmed down and she was able to eat. \nMy bf is upset I caused a scene in front of some of his friends and everyone really at the restaurant but I just couldn\u2019t sit back watch, and say nothing. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for inserting myself and yelling at strangers?\n\nJust some clarification after all the comments: I do agree and feel terrible that I could have put her in a position to get yelled at later. That wasn\u2019t my intention. I saw red, mostly because I have been through exactly this and have gone home in tears and feeling alone. I would normally not get into anyones business. I appreciate all your feedback and for sure next time I feel the urge to say something I\u2019m going to take a breath and find a better way to communicate that doesn\u2019t put anyone in danger or interrupt other people. My bf is still not talking to me until I apologize because again I embarrassed him, regardless of the reason. Feel like I should just send a text to his friends and keep it moving.\n\nUpdate:\nWow guys- thank you for all the responses, support, advice and criticism. These past 24hrs have been crazy, so here\u2019s a quick update. \n\nI mentioned in a previous comment but will say again that the young mom did give me a smile as we were saying our goodbyes in the parking lot and they were leaving. In terms of this situation like I said I could of had more tact and really hope I didn\u2019t expose her to more abuse in retaliation. \n\nAs for my boyfriend- well now ex because HE BROKE UP (well told me he needed space) with me. I showed him the thread and this is what happened:\n\n1. Super pissed that I posted this on here. \u2018Why am I putting our business out on the internet?\u2019 And basically I wanted people to turn against him (what?!) and more attention then I already took at the restaurant \n2. One of his friends is very conservative and while his friend didn\u2019t actually say anything to my ex he says his friend was definitely offended by the breastfeeding at the table because it\u2019s not hygienic. He doesn\u2019t agree that she should have gone to bathroom but it wasn\u2019t the appropriate place to feed.\n3. One of the things he liked about me was how I kept my \u2018mom life\u2019 separate from my relationship with him. And that while he was weirded out that I never invited him to my house the entire time we\u2019ve been dating (2yrs) he appreciated not having to be involved because he has never wanted kids. Doesn\u2019t like them. So basically I set a boundary from the beginning of \u2018no kid stuff\u2019 I crossed it at the restaurant and made a big scene in front of his friends who he says were also embarrassed but weren\u2019t going to say anything. \n\nSo like this is all still going on. I\u2019m a bit sad - like maybe I did do the most- but also I\u2019m like f him. Since me and my daughters dad split 50/50 I can see how someone can see me and not realize that I\u2019m a whole ass mother. The reason I don\u2019t let people I\u2019m dating come to my house is because at the end of the day I don\u2019t know these people from Adam (did you torture animals as a child \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and rather than expose my daughter to variables (guys character or behaviors) I prefer if they don\u2019t have access. I know it may sound crazy or weird, but when I was in college a guy I dated would show up to my apartment drunk yelling for me outside my window. So I\u2019m not leaving the door even cracked for something like this to happen and my daughter be home with me. She\u2019d be terrified. \n\nSo what he said was he needed a break and I just said let\u2019s just not do this at all because it\u2019s not gonna work. For sure I set boundaries with my kid but if anything involving kids is a problem than we aren\u2019t going to work because again I am a mother. And even on my days \u2018off\u2019 I\u2019m on call because anything can happen and I need to be there regardless. \n\nThank you guys for all your responses. It\u2019s hard sometimes when things blow up like this to whisk away the bullshit and see things for what they are.",

        "text": "My little brother is 18. I'm 20. I am staying with my family for the holidays and thought it'd be a nice time but I forgot that they treat me like a housekeeper. I do almost all the chores and I don't mind if its MY chore. Obviously, if I notice the dishwashers full, I empty it. If I cook, I clean up. If I make a mess, I clean up. However, if my little brother makes a mess. He makes me clean up. If I refuse and tell him to do it himself, he tells my parents and they side with him and just bug me until I do it. \n\nMy brother also asks me to cook for him. He pulls out brownie mix and is like \"make this.\" I always am like: \"Sure, I can make it but you have to help.\" He gets mad and says \"I helped by taking out the box!\" And when I refused to make stuff for him or tell him to make it himself, he'll throw a fit and tell our parents. \n\nLately, he keeps asking me to make stuff and I get frustrated going back and forth about why can't he make shit himself or just ask our parents. So I make the food he asks, but I always add stuff he doesn't like. (coincidentally, he hates a ton of stuff I love to eat ) So if he asks for brownies and refuses to help, I put nuts in it. He hates them and I like them. He came over to see the brownies and got mad at me and told me he hated nuts and can't eat the brownies anymore. I just said, \"too bad, make it yourself next time or help me and tell me not to put nuts in.\" I thought he'd learn his lesson to at least help but he keeps asking for stuff and I just keep putting stuff in that he doesn't like.\n\nHe finally got fed up and said he's not eating because I keep making stuff with stuff he doesn't like. I just shrugged and told him to make his own food then. He told my parents of course and they just told me to stop being an asshole and make food for him. It was my last day at home so I just told them to make food for him if they're so concerned before I left. Now my parents are upset with me and my brother is angry with me and I am wondering if I was too petty",

        "text": "My ex and I were engaged, living together, and planning on trying for kids after the wedding. The wedding got delayed and I found out I was pregnant shortly after. My ex freaked out. Insisted it couldn't be his baby because he wasn't ready to be a dad, that this was all happening too fast and wasn't how we planned it, and said he needed some time to think everything over. He then moved out, blocked me, and didn't answer any kind of attempted contact for 10 months.\n\nOur child was born without him there and I named our daughter, \"Elizabeth Laura Smith\" without his input. Elizabeth because I like it and it reminds me of my favourite book character (I work in literature), Laura after my grandmother, and Smith is my surname. My ex has reached out. He said he waited this long because he wasn't sure how far along I was when we were together but he figured the baby had to have been born by now. I said that his timing was a little off, because she's 5 months old.\n\nEx has said he's planning to sort out custody. We've not discussed logistics yet, but he's unlikely to get anything before she turns 1. He asked if I'd named her yet, and I told him what I'd named her.\n\nEx then said he hates that name. He thinks it sounds old and stuffy. He says that as his mother, \"Mary\", has recently (November 2019) passed away, he wants to name our daughter Mary. He says Mary *must* be the first name and that I can have either Elizabeth or Laura as the middle name.\n\nI made clear, in no uncertain terms, that I will not change her name. I hate the name Mary. I hate how it sounds, both alone and with \"Elizabeth/Laura Smith\" on the end of it. Plus I didn't like his mother, either (though I didn't remind him of that).\n\nEx said that if we're going to co-parent then I have to learn to compromise and this is the place to start, and that it's unfair that I got to choose both her first and middle name.\n\nI said that if he hadn't blocked me for the better part of a year, he'd have been able to say all of this when she was born.\n\nEx said that the above is proof that I'm being petty and that he can't undo the past, but I can prevent any feelings of dislike/resentment from him over this name in future, and that as the father he should have a say in his daughter's name. He also says that he's willing to let her be a \"Smith\" and not force me to use his surname, which he feels is proof he has already negotiated.\n\nAm I the A-hole?",

        "text": "I\u2019ll try to summarize as much as possible. \n\nI (f19) have an estranged grandpa more or less. He\u2019s my dad\u2019s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. I have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). My grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn\u2019t see him. \n\nWhen he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. He\u2019d stay for a week at a time and then go home. He was an old, bitter man to be honest. He never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he\u2019d had his whole life. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. \n\nI was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. \n\nHe died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know what to do with the money, but I\u2019m going to save it. \n\nMy dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can\u2019t do it. \n\nMy dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. \n\nAs far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he\u2019s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. \n\nMy little sister is the only person I\u2019ve actually considered. She\u2019s very young and that\u2019s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I\u2019m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. \n\nBut now my family is telling me I\u2019m unfair and the money doesn\u2019t belong to me and I\u2019m not deserving of it. That I\u2019m too young and I\u2019ll waste it on cars and clothes. \n\nI don\u2019t agree and now they\u2019re all threatening to cut me off and never speak to me, or even sue me if I don\u2019t give them all a chunk of the money. I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m buckling under pressure here. I\u2019ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming I stole the money from him. Everything was through an attorney, I know I did nothing wrong legally.. but morally? Idk. So AITA?",

        "text": "Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the \"best unwatchable episode of TV ever\" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. \n\nSo how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the \"removed\" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. \n\nMy cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. \n\nI basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  \n\nThat's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of \"Scott's Tots\" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. \n\nNo amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). \n\nThere is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. \n\nI have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?\n\nEdit: just for my own notes since I\u2019m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.\n\nCousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.\n\nCousin/sister  J, 32: paid.\n\nMe: paid \n\nCousin B, 25: not paid.\n\nCousin J2, 20: in school.\n\nNiece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).\n\nA, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day.",

I have explained to them how this all came to be, but in my explanation I neglected to tell them which was my biological child.\n\nDue to my ex having a type, the other woman looked enough like me that the boys could pass for twins. Same dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and both cleft chins and dimples. My brother jokes that they look like tiny Supermen. People who know them refer to them as twins because aside from a few minor differences, they're practically identical. Frankly, if they were closer in age and I'd had full custody of both from the time they were born, I suspect I would have mixed them up a lot as babies.\n\nShortly before Clark's birthday last year, my mum asked if she could see Clark's birth certificate. I asked why and she said she wanted to know the exact time he was born, so I told her. She asked if she could see the certificate anyway. I asked why. She said she just wanted to check. I said I'm his mother, I know when he was born. Then she asked the same thing about Kent and we went through the same conversation all over again. Mum eventually admitted that she just wanted to see the birth mother's name on each certificate, which isn't even how that works and I told her as much.\n\nThis led to an argument where my stance was that I'm their mother, biology is irrelevant. Mum says if biology is irrelevant then it's not a big deal to tell her which of them is biologically mine. I said if she's so hung up on biology, then clearly it's a big deal to her and I don't want it to be a big deal, especially as the boys themselves don't know.\n\nMum feels this is incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and overall wrong. She feels that if biology isn't such a big issue, then I should have no problem telling her whether Clark or Kent is my biological son, and that accusing her of potential favouritism or something similar with her bio grandchild is an unfair judgement with no actual reasoning to it.\n\nMy boyfriend agrees that I shouldn't tell anyone at least until my sons have decided for themselves if they want to know and want other people to know, but my entire family agree with mum that I'm being unreasonably selfish and that my actions now are more likely to cause issues than mum's potential actions later.\n\nAm I in the wrong?",

        "text": "I (F20) moved out on my 18th birthday and never looked back. I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don\u2019t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn\u2019t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn\u2019t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were \u201cclean\u201d meaning, they didn\u2019t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. \n\nSo you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn\u2019t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren\u2019t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn\u2019t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. \n\nI didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it\u2019s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i\u2019ll join and say hi. As i\u2019m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend\u2019s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone\u2019s face kinda froze and i didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nMy mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn\u2019t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again\n\nMy mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn\u2019t know what else to do but laugh. I said \u201care you out of your mind\u201d and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it\u2019s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?\n\n~~~\nEdit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! \n\nFor those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it\u2019s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.\n\nI seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I\u2019d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they\u2019ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i\u2019ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I\u2019m not familiar with setting boundaries sorry\n\nI found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i\u2019m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not.",

Lia's mom seems to have a problem with me, or my sexuality or something, Lia is bi and her mom seems to wish she'd stayed with one of her male exes.\n\nSo anyway at Christmas, we were taking photos and her mom was like \"OP, we want the photos to be family only..\" Lia started to protest, like \"we're married, mom\" but I didn't want an argument so I said \"it's ok, I'll take the pictures.\" \n\nIt was kind of cringy because lia's sister's husband, and cousin and his wife and son were there so there were definitely spouses and children included\n\n I was kind of annoyed and decided to not take the best ones... Just on purpose, focused the camera on the furniture rather than people, snapped pictures zoomed in awkwardly close, used unflattering flash, didn't hold my hands steady so they were blurry, took pictures on purpose when someone was looking away or coughing or something.\n\nAnyway I took like 30 pictures and they ranged from bad to horrible. And I gave the camera back and said that I hope they find a nice one to frame in there.\n\nAfter everything, Lia was angry on my behalf, said her mom had no right to treat me like that and I didn't have to say \"it's ok\" when it was totally rude. And I just started laughing and told her what I'd done. We snuck down to the dining room later that night and she lost it laughing at the pictures I'd taken. She even deleted some of the more decent ones.\n\nWe're still waiting for her mom to plug her camera into the computer and see the pictures. We're planning on saying I tried my best but didn't know how to use a dslr camera if anyone says something\n\nAITA for taking bad photos on purpose?",

        "text": "16 years ago my son Matthew had a daughter with his now ex wife Josie. I have always thought of Josie as my own daughter, so when they divorced 7 years ago due to my son cheating, I was conflicted and disappointed. Josie wasn\u2019t particularly close with any of her family, so My husband and I naturally took them in. Josie was an angel, she had insisted that we didn\u2019t have to lift a finger more than before we had taken them in and though she was hurt, she kept civil around Matthew.\n\nMy husband and I held a huge hand in raising their daughter Ruth, because Matthew remarried less than a year later and now has a four year old son after disowning Ruth. Two years ago my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer, it was hard on everyone, especially Ruth. They were extremely close, she told him about her girlfriends and boyfriends before anyone else and has always wanted him to be the one to walk her down the isle at her wedding. Matt rarely ever visited and didn\u2019t answer our calls often saying that we had other kids so it wasn\u2019t like my husband was dying lonely.\n\nLast night Matt stopped by to talk about inheritance, he never mentioned Josie nor Ruth and hinted that he thought he should get more inheritance than his siblings the entire time. My husband and I shared awkward looks until he decided to cut in, he explained that everyone would get a piece, but he\u2019d focus more on Ruth and Bonnie (one of our other grandkids). Matt got angry and said that Ruth was just a bastard and that his son deserved more than her, my husband got furious after that and left the room saying that he wouldn\u2019t include Matthew at all. \n\nMatt yelled back and turned to me saying that Ruth wasn\u2019t worth it because she\u2019d just grow up to be a whore like her mother, I told him that i\u2019d rather have her mother as my daughter than him as my son and insisted that he leave. I\u2019m getting phone calls from Matt\u2019s wife and family friends saying that my husband and I overreacted and he was just angry that we were playing favorites.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: To clear some things up: Josie did not cheat on Matthew, Josie and Matthew met later in college and Josie was known as a \u201cparty girl\u201d before that, Ruth isn\u2019t the product of an affair but we are planning on getting a DNA test because what Matthew said has gotten under Ruth\u2019s skin (she was at the house when this occurred and over heard it)\n\nWhen it came to taking in Josie and Ruth we didn\u2019t hesitate because Josie is not from here, she and Matt lived in another country until he moved them here a few months before he got caught cheating and they had no where else to go as Josie was a stay at home mom. i had no intentions of \u201cchoosing\u201d Josie over Matt, then and now, and I never discouraged Matt from visiting, i tried to make it very clear that we weren\u2019t picking and choosing when we took Josie in, we just wanted her and our granddaughter to be safe and have a good home.",

She makes comments about African Americans being \"ugly\" but the race she has the most prejudice towards is anyone who is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. She generalizes the way they speak and mocks them, she says they're all ugly, makes comments about how they \"shouldn't drive\" because they \"can't see\" properly, etc.\n\nI've heard this all throughout my life from her and every time I've wanted to call her out but was afraid of what she'd say because all my life she's been a ticking time bomb and most of the time I'm too exhausted to deal with her constantly going on a rampage of saying cruel things and then playing the victim after it all.\n\nThis time in particular however, I was watching \"A Silent Voice\" beautiful anime movie by the way, it brought me to tears.  One of the scenes showing how Shouko speaks aloud was on while my mom was in the room, and of course as per routine she made a stupid comment basically stating that she's surprised anyone batted an eye at how she talks given that it's supposedly \"as unintelligible as any other Asian.\"\n\nI spoke up and said \"Oh shit, I forgot I can't watch what I enjoy without you trying too hard to make us laugh with an unfunny racist comment.\" She said \"Excuse me?\" to which I replied that I was pretty sure she heard me, and then she asked me what it was like to have a \"fetish\" for Asian people (???) so I said \"What's it like to have such a bland personality that being a racist bitch is your main trait?\"\n\nShe BLEW UP and told me I had no right to speak to her that way because she was my mother.  Basically I shrugged and I said that I'm treating her as I would any prejudiced person.  I was grounded for being \"disrespectful\" because apparently being racist is nothing but an opinion /s.\n\nPretty much the same hour I walked out of the house and announced that I was sleeping over at a friend's house because there's no way I was gonna serve a punishment for calling out a racist.  I'm getting mixed reactions.  Some say I was fully in the right and didn't need to change a thing, others say while I was in the right I should've just taken the punishment because I knew what the outcome would be.

My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.\n\nThis women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.\n\nAnyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.\n\nSo for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.\n\nSo a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)\n\n\"Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.\"\n\nI did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.\n\nI can't deal with this nonsense and I'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",

        "text": "I\u2019m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. \nIt was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife\u2019s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I\u2019ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. \n\nMy flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, \u201cMark.\u201d I\u2019ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we\u2019re \u201cfriendly\u201d i honestly don\u2019t know him that well. But you can tell he\u2019s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.\n\nMark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. \n\nMark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I\u2019d politely decline. It\u2019s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I\u2019m either drinking a soda/water and it\u2019s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me \u201cprincess\u201d; I don\u2019t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.\n\nAll my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he\u2019d forget about me. But every now and then he\u2019d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn\u2019t want to drink. \n\nMy wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I\u2019d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he \u201cunderstood now\u201d. \n\nMark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that\u2019ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I\u2019ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, \u201cactually I don\u2019t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.\u201d\n\nWiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. \n\nOur flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn\u2019t his fault he didn\u2019t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he\u2019s the only one right now that\u2019s taking Mark\u2019s side.\n\nHe said I could\u2019ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. \n\nNow yes I could\u2019ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that\u2019s none of his business and a \u201cno\u201d should\u2019ve been enough. \n\nI only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",

        "text": "I'm a 33-year-old man and my wife is 27.\n\nSince the start of our relationship, my wife has been very particular about how things get done, and tends to believe that she knows the one true correct way for anything related to anything. She has admitted that she can be a control freak. While this bothers me, it has never been a true dealbreaker in our relationship.\n\nVery often when I do just about anything, whether it be a household chore, assembling a piece of furniture, taking a picture, or writing a presentation for work (in a field where I have a master's degree and she has no formal education), she'll do this thing where she'll condescendingly say \"You were *so close* to getting it right,\" really drawing out the \"so close\" part. I've told her dozens of times that I'd prefer for her to stop because it sounds so condescending, but she insists that she's complimenting me.\n\nI do the dishes and place them out to dry in an orientation she doesn't approve of?\n\n>You were *so close*. Next time, put them that way.\n\nI take a picture of her?\n\n>You were *so close*. Next time, angle the camera this way.\n\nI complete a project at work and show her the results?\n\n>You were *so close*. Next time, write it this way.\n\nFor the last two months my wife has been undergoing an intensive hiring process for a job in our city. She works in a highly niche field and seldom finds job openings, and therefore she was ecstatic to have the opportunity for a relatively well-paying job doing what she wants to do. She got to the very final stage where the company was considering two people, coincidentally the other of whom was her college roommate. Well, on Friday she got \"the call\" telling her thanks for her application but blah blah blah, record on file, all that jazz.\n\nMy wife came to me crying. I immediately comforted her and \"You were *so close*\" blurted out. Her head whipped up and she asked what I meant by that. I said she was *so close* to getting the job, but was just a bit off. She immediately walked out to stay at her friend's house, where she is currently sulking. She finally sent me a text this afternoon calling me a huge jerk. \n\nWas I unnecessarily being an asshole here?",

        "text": "Longtime lurker, first time account/posting - I\u2019ve debated posting this for a while now, but since I\u2019ve been so vocal the last few days on this subreddit I figured it was time to find out if I was TA instead of just commenting on others.\n\nMy wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I\u2019ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We\u2019re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. \n\nThe next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an \u201cannouncement\u201d to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, \u201cNope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It\u2019s my day. Thank you for understanding.\u201d and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nFlash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fianc\u00e9 announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! \n\nI\u2019m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It\u2019s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I\u2019m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited. \n\nSo reddit, aita for not allowing them to get engaged during my wedding reception and aita for not attending the wedding on my one year anniversary?\n\nEDIT: You guys have been so sweet! I\u2019m trying my best to reply back to every single comment since you all took the time to comment on my post.  (Y\u2019all will get your reply eventually!) Thank you guys so much! It\u2019s totally making me feel better after this messed up situation! \ud83d\udc95",

He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging. \n\nNow my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why. \n\nI was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person.\n\n\nAITA? Did I go too far?\n\n*Info based on request from a user:_ He has a history of mental health issues but got better the past few months. He also had a recent death in his family which really affected his health generally*",

They're all friends and quite close so it's not weird for them at all. My sister often makes jokes about how all lesbians know each other and how lesbian relationships tend to work. For example; my girlfriend and I were together a year before we moved in together, and my sister joked that \"that's like a decade in Lesbian Years\". My girlfriend asked me about the ex being in the wedding party and why they chose to do so cause it seemed like it would be awkward. I said it isn't for them and she asked why. I just shrugged and said \"I don't know man, lesbians.\" \n\nMy girlfriend got pretty mad at me and said that was homophobic and playing into stereotypes and I shouldn't have said it. My sister laughed when I told her but idk, the things my gf said are sticking with me and making me feel pretty bad. What do you lot think?",

He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay \"friends\" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.\n\nHe married his affair partner. They had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. Last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.\n\nWhat followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.\n\nWhat I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.\n\nBut I guess part of me does feel bad for the child. My son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and I hate that for them.\n\nAITA?",

        "text": "My sister (20f) and I (27f) don\u2019t get along. I\u2019m gay, and when she was 14 she started being horrible to me, calling me slurs and saying I was going to burn in hell and other typical religious homophobic things. She is the golden child so obviously my parents sided with her, she would make me cry and they would tell me to deal with it and expected me to still be nice to her. After a while, I cut them all out of my life. Best decision ever.\n\n3 years ago I married the love of my life, my parents were invited but they didn\u2019t show, no doubt because of my sister. Still hurt. My wife L and I are both very lucky and have amazing jobs and a big house. About a week ago, my parents and sister showed up to my house (no idea how they know I live there) and wanted to talk to me. Turns out sister\u2019s pregnant and they essentially want me to let her move in for free AND pay for everything for her and the baby. There was no apology for anything. I was in shock and my sister was going off about how we have so much space and we could afford to help her out.\n\nI said no. I told them we couldn\u2019t take her in because we currently have L\u2019s two little half sisters staying with us because their mom is very high risk, so we don\u2019t have anymore space. They were pissed and were going off about how I was supposed to help my family and that I was choosing L\u2019s family over my own, I told them they were not my family. I told them everything they had done and say to me and they said I needed to let it go and move on. I asked them to leave. Even if we had space I wouldn\u2019t want her here.\n\nSince then I have gotten so many messages from them and other family members saying I need to help them and take her in. I reminded them of what she has been like to me, and they say I need to be the bigger person and that this will bring us together. Thing is, my parents are going to have to take money out of their retirement fund if I don\u2019t help. They were good parents growing up, when my sister started her bs I was already out of the house. So people have said that i would really be helping them, not my sister. L said we could give her some money, but I don\u2019t want to do that either. AITA?\n\nEdited because I forgot to add that I don\u2019t feel for her at all, I just feel bad about my parents.\n\n\nUpdate - thank you all for the kind words! We are not taking her in but might give my parents some money in the future if we see they are struggling. \nAlso, my sister is 7 months pregnant and just recently told my parents because she couldn\u2019t hide it anymore, so they are desperate because there\u2019s no time to save up now. My mom just sent me my sister\u2019s baby registry and I can\u2019t believe her!!! She is living off my parents and doesn\u2019t have a job but is asking people to get her a $300 car seat and a $700 stroller.\n\nEdit - Please don\u2019t post this anywhere.\n\n\nEdit- Wow! I came back to like a thousand more replies, seriously thank you all for your advice. Yes, I know my parents are also to blame. They have never been \u2018homophobic\u2019 but they never told her off because they wanted to \u2018keep the peace\u2019 and I know that\u2019s a shitty excuse but I would only see them like once a month while my sister was there full time and they never want to upset her. And the wedding - my dad called me because my sister was upset she wasn\u2019t invited and asked me to invite her but I said no so they didn\u2019t show up. \n\nThe main reason I feel like I need to help them is because they put me through college. I got a scholarship and my parents paid for the rest which was still a lot of money. My sister went to a community college so they didn\u2019t pay nearly as much for her.\nThank you all again!",

        "text": "[OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)\n\nIt's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and I guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!\n\nIn my last post, I stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to \"disown\" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)\n\nAlrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. Despite the chain of advice I sent her, she ignored me still. I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.\n\nI had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. LMAO. What a fucking asshole. Glad my sister finally returned to her senses. She told me she broke it off with him and I sincerely hope that's the truth.\n\nThis past Monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. According to my mom, she was begging that they do is ASAP, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.\n\nThe future seems pretty bright right now for her. My parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and I think it'd be great for her). She's officially starting next Monday. I'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)\n\nTL;DR: Sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. Delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and McDonald's. Sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. I urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",

        "text": "This will sound unbelievable to those not from my country. All I can say is that it is real.\n\nWhen I was 5, my parents brought my dad\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter X (about 3) to live with me and sister Y (7). X\u2019s family was poor and couldn\u2019t support their children (they had 6) so they sent X here because they really trusted my parents. \n\nX, Y, and I grew up together, and my parents were awesome to all three of us. I had a lot of fun growing up and I am extremely close to my family.  \n\nI\u2019m now 29. Three years back, I went abroad for my masters and then went back to my country. There, I met a girl P and we fell in love. I\u2019d like to propose soon and felt like this would be a good time to introduce P to my family (Y already knew of her and P just graduated). \n\nThis weekend I told my family that I would like for them to meet someone special and set-up a video call. No idea who they were expecting, but when they realized P was my girlfriend, everything just blew up.  \n\nApparently, they had already \u201cdiscussed and arranged\u201d my marriage with X years back, and she was the one I would have to marry. X was aware, her father had told her. Cue lots of screaming and yelling, including some choice words from X to P about how she\u2019s a \u201cmodern girl\u201d (euphemism in my culture for slut) and how she must be after me for my money (she comes from a richer family). I was just too shocked to react initially. \n\nThe next day I told my parents that I look at X as family. They started saying ridiculous things like they\u2019ve never let her into my room (while apparently Y was allowed) and drawing all sorts of other parallels between X and Y trying to demonstrate why X wasn\u2019t like my sister. They also said stuff like no one can understand me better than X and that she will \u201ckeep the family together\u201d while P will \u201calienate\u201d me from them. They also told me I\u2019m ruining the family.\n\nX also cried nonstop and then shut herself in the room, accusing me of not wanting her only because she was poor amongst other things. She also said no one from her village would marry her now because her family has told everyone back home that she\u2019s going to be marrying me. \n\nMy sister was not aware of any of this either. \n\nNow \u2013 I told X I don\u2019t care that no one will marry her from her village (it is a likely possibility) or that her life is \u201cruined\u201d. I also told my parents I won\u2019t ruin my life for them to be able to \u201ckeep their word\u201d. X\u2019s father is coming to our house once he\u2019s able to (transport restrictions still in place), but he had a long phone call with parents. I\u2019m sure a LOT of emotional blackmail is to follow, and I already feel rather guilty about X because she\u2019s a nice girl. \n\nMy sister is on my side. But even if my parents cut me off and at the risk of X ruining her life, I am not going to go ahead with this at all. AITA?\n\nEdit: A lot of people asking me where I'm from - It's a SE Asian country, just don't want to say if it's the exact place you guys are asking about. \n\nX was apparently aware I didn't know. But she was told by my parents and hers that I'm a \"Family man\" and will do the \"right thing\" so there's no need to worry. She's basically accused me of wrecking the family too. \n\nMy sister is really upset on my behalf, and also that she wasn't told any of this. My sister's family (her husband and his parents) have said if there's any sort of confrontation, they'll be there to back me up.\n\nNot sure if this detail counts, but P is also from my country but also came abroad to study. So that's not a reason as to why my parents are unaccepting of P. They just want me to marry X.",

Anyways, after the announcement and in the middle of the celebration my husband wanted to give a toast. He opened a bottle and poured a drink and wished that our daughter be \"healthy, happy, but look nothing like me\". Everyone at the table laughed. I sat there staring in shock while he kept laughing with them. I felt so much rage and my anxiety got out of hand ngl. I got up, took my purse and made my way out. His mom followed me asking if I was okay,  I told her I just wanted tk go home. He came to the door asking what was wrong that's when we started arguing. He said this was a \"joke toast\" and that my reaction was over the top, but the thing is eversince i got pregnant he kept hinting he doesn't want our daughter to look like me. He even once got up in the morning and first thing he told me was how much he wished our daughter look nothing like me. It hurt me while I'm already dealing with low self esteem and anxiety. I wanted to go home but he said I was being a baby and that I should learn to take a \"fucking\" joke. I said he made everyone laugh at me buy he defensively said it didn't warrant me to walk out of dinner and be so disrespectful to the re,ative who came to celebrate and share our joy.\n\nI went home and he called many times telling me to get my \"insecurities\" in check before j pass them up to our daughter, he urged me to get therapy and stop acting so dramatically like how I did infront of his family.\n\nI think leaving dinner wasn't thf best solution but I just got overwhelmed.",

I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.\n\nAm I wrong here?",

        "text": "My boyfriend's mom makes theses amazing cookie bars. She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was \"hers\" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.\n\nI started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).\n\nI then decided to make it \"my own\" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.\n\nHe was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said \"One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better.\" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making \"her\" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.\n\nShe started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.\n\nWhile I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I \"made it even better\" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?\n\n\\*\\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:\n\nI used the recipe below for the \"base\" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.\n\n[https://luluthebaker.com/the-tale-of-the-carmelitas/](https://luluthebaker.com/the-tale-of-the-carmelitas/)",

We decided to get married sooner than we planned because the situation was good where we live and we didn't want to risk having to cancel if numbers spike.\n\nBefore, I took your advice and called my friend. I explained how severe my allergies are once again and told her how I really want to be able to enjoy my wedding day. I apologized for making suggestions and not simply asking her and said she is welcome to bring up any ideas that would help her being able to attend (she told me she still wanted to) that do not include her dog. She was adamant that it was her dog or nothing. While disappointed I was prepared for that and told her that would not be possible and that she will be missed at the wedding. \n\nWe sent out the new invitations with the new date and simply didn't invite her so technically she wasn't uninvited.\n\nSome of our mutual friends that are in the wedding told me that she'd asked them not to attend in solidarity but luckily they all thought that was ridiculous.\n\nWe had a beautiful wedding and spent our honeymoon in the Flinders Ranges which I can only recommend. \n\nAs for my friend, I'm open to reconciliation but she will have to make the first step.\n\nSo that's it. While it didn't go as I hoped it would I'm still in a happy place now enjoying my life as a married woman.",

It is by prescription and it is expensive. it also comes in packaging that is meant to be stored upright. \n\nNot on its side and definitely not upside down. \n\nMy daughter has her hair products in the shower and I do not touch them.

They have already wasted an entire bottle of my shampoo by storing it upside down after they touched it for some reason. It all dripped out the spout which is not engineered for that. \n\nI talked to both of them and I explained that they should not touch my stuff and that if they accidentally tip over my shampoo it was meant to be stored with the lid at the top. \n\nI came home last week to find my shampoo leaking out of the bottle again.

        "text": "I (26F) am getting married in about two months. I sent out my wedding invitations recently and at the bottom it says \u201cADULTS ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS.\u201d First let me say that I love kids. But my fianc\u00e9 and I made the decision to not allow kids/babies to our ceremony because they get bored, cry, won\u2019t sit still, have tantrums... and I just don\u2019t want that to happen during our wedding. We\u2019re also going to have an open bar, and I don\u2019t particularly want a bunch of drunk adults around my little cousins or my friend\u2019s children. \n\nI have a cousin, we\u2019ll call her Sam, that text me last night saying \u201cso you\u2019re dead honest seriously telling me I cannot bring (her son) to your wedding\u201d- to which I said yes. Sam responds \u201cthen I can\u2019t come and that f****** kills me. I just want you to know how badly I want to be there and I have dreamt my entire life of standing next to you at your wedding. But I just can\u2019t want to be somewhere with someone who doesn\u2019t want the other half of my heart there.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s trying guilt trip me into letting her bring her son. Saying \u201cand I\u2019ve confided in my best friends and they say it\u2019s your wedding it\u2019s your right to have it the way you want, but yeah. I just want you to know it\u2019s not vengeance when I don\u2019t come. I\u2019ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.\u201d I suggested that she take her son (he\u2019s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says \u201cI can\u2019t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I\u2019m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn\u2019t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He\u2019s too smart to manipulate.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not asking her to manipulate her son. I\u2019m asking that she be an adult, and tell him he can\u2019t come and that children aren\u2019t allowed to attend, so she\u2019ll take him to his friends while she\u2019s gone.\n\nNot to mention, that she\u2019s angry that I didn\u2019t choose her to be my Maid of Honor. I chose my step-sister. While on the phone, Sam said \u201cI don\u2019t mean any offense by this, but FUCK HER.\u201d She\u2019s literally only mad because my dad cheated on my mom 10 years ago and married the woman he cheated with. She hates my sister, because she hates my step mom. \n\nI ended up being on the phone with her for half an hour talking to her about this. With her constantly telling me \u201cI\u2019m trying to get sober, so I just wanted to talk to you and tell you how I feel.\u201d Which to me, sounds like she\u2019s going to blame me if I still tell her no, and she decides to drink/so drugs again. \n\nWe ended the phone call with her saying \u201cwill you just promise me one thing, even if it\u2019s a lie? Will you just promise me that you\u2019ll consider it, and that you\u2019ll talk to your fianc\u00e9 about it?\u201d So I told her yes, that I promised I\u2019d consider it/talk to him about it. And I did, I considered it, I talked (angry cried) to him, and I\u2019m not changing my mind. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n***************************************\n\nUPDATE: I texted her two days ago, and used the wording suggested by u/sunny_sally. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more than for you to be at my wedding. I love (her son), but after speaking to (fianc\u00e9), we came to the conclusion that we still do not feel comfortable having kids at our wedding. This is a decision we made before we started the planning, knowing that some people might disagree with it. If you aren\u2019t able to get a baby sitter, I would completely understand why you wouldn\u2019t come. And I also spoke with (her step dad), he said he will be attending.\u201d\n\nShe responded in less than a minute and said \u201cok.\u201d\n\nSo I guess we\u2019ll see how this goes.",

        "text": "\nMy daughter recieved a bike from her uncle (my brother) on her 11th birthday, she was over the moon and excited to use it because it was on her wishlist for so long.\n\n\nDays ago, I discovered that my husband reached out to my brother to ask for the recipient for the bike and returned it to the store and kept the money for himself while my daughter was at school (the bike was at home). My daughter and I got home and she started crying after noticing the bike was gone. My husband was home at the time, he told me he returned the bike and got money in return to spend on something useful for us since the bike was just there as a \"distraction\" and there was no need for it now since we're the dead of winter. I was aggravated and lost it on him saying it wasn't his, didn't come from him, and he didn't pay for it so he had no right to touch it ESPECIALLY knowing our daughter's been wanting it for a long time and my brother was decent enough to buy it for her despite barely having money to get him by. I told him what he did was theft and insisted he hand over the money to me so I could re-purchase it but he said he spent it on stuff for the house and doesn't have any money left now but I knew about the money he was stashing away in the bedroom that he forbade me from toucing and I took some of it and went out to re-purchase the bike while he was out the next day.\n\nHe found out and verbally lashed out at me saying I should've never touched the money he was saving for himself which isn't much but I lashed right back that I had to so I could re-purchase the bike he took from under our daughter. He explained that he didn't keep the money for himself and instead spent it for necessities for our home but he was at fault for taking the bike in the first place and he was responsible for getting it back. He yelled at me for almost 10 minutes then stormed outside and started smoking.\n\nMy daughter asked why her dad was upset and that she no longer wants the bike if dad doesn't want her to have it, but I assured her that's not the case and told her she shouldn't feel guilty and to just focus on enjoying her bike.\n\nMy husband hasn't stopped grilling me about how I disrespected and undermined him and managed to make our daughter hate him after making him look like the bad guy, I again said he shouldn't have touched the bike, end of the story/// He's called me theif and juvenile for taking money from his savings and being sneaky about it.\n\nAITA for the way I got the bike back?",

        "text": "So I\u2019m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I\u2019m straight, I\u2019m very feminine, and I just don\u2019t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I\u2019m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I\u2019m dating a new guy in my life and I\u2019ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. \n\nSo I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. \n\nWhen I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn\u2019t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn\u2019t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. \n\nI told him I didn\u2019t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I\u2019d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn\u2019t need to discuss it any further. \n\nLater today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I\u2019m freaking out and it\u2019s making me so anxious.\nAITA for not shaving my legs for my job?\n\nEDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I\u2019m not mad at him and don\u2019t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn\u2019t even force dress code and stuff. But also I really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since I\u2019ve worked there 8 months with no incident.",

        "text": "I have a home daycare. I like to think I\u2019m pretty lenient but I do have one big rule: Don\u2019t make me the bad guy. I understand we might have different rules but don\u2019t make your child resent me by not backing me up.\n\nAnyway, another rule is I don\u2019t allow outside toys or electronics. Kids can bring a stuffed animals for nap if they\u2019re sleeping on rest mats but I don\u2019t want to be responsible if something gets broken. Years ago, I used to let kids bring whatever. Then a cheap McDonalds toy broke by accident, kid was upset and mom got mad at me. So now it\u2019s a hard rule.\n\nMost are okay with it. But I have a new kid (3) who\u2019s mom wanted him to bring his tablet because \u201che needs it\u201d. I said sorry but no. I\u2019m not going to be responsible for it. We went back and forth but finally she just says fine. But every morning, he\u2019s crying because she took his tablet from him in the car. She always gives me this look and says \u201cMiss Lucy says no tablet.\u201d I always try to say we have plenty of toys, but the kids spends the whole morning sulking. I\u2019ve talked to mom, asked her to leave it at home and not even put it in the car but she says he \u201cneeds it\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s been a month and yesterday was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Kid came in crying as usual. I tried my usual redirection which didn\u2019t work. Mom was giving me a look of \u201csee what you did\u201d. Then she had the nerve to say to him \u201cI know you need your tablet, we\u2019ve talked about this before, Miss Lucy is strict\u201d. That pissed me off. I ended up telling her to take him home right then and there. She was shocked and tried to stammer. He was my first kid of the day so there was no scene. I just handed back his backpack, said he was no longer a student of mine and began to pack his extra clothes and the sippy cup he kept. Mom was in tears as she left.\n\nMy husband thinks she was right. I\u2019m too strict and should\u2019ve broken policy instead of causing drama. AITA?\n\nEdit: There was no medical need for the tablet. It was all just that he wanted it.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not making a waiver for electronics. That won\u2019t stop other issues with the tablets, such as jealousy and drama.\n\nEdit 3: Who reported to Reddit Care that you think I\u2019m suicidal?? Where did you get that?\n\nEdit 4: So my \u201cdon\u2019t make me the bad guy rule\u201d has been misunderstood, partly as I worded it poorly. I don\u2019t expect blind obedience. No one has to agree with my rules. They can challenge them, to me. But to their kid, I\u2019d rather them explain everyone has different rules and that while they\u2019re with me, things will be different.\n\nI do the same with parents who have different rules than mine. I never say they\u2019re wrong or strict, I say that we have different rules at school and to listen to mom and dad.\n\nThis is also a policy for pacifiers, bottles and potty training. I\u2019ll approach any of these milestones when you ask, but you have to be working on it at home too. The kid won\u2019t progress if they only go pee on the potty at home.\n\nAnd the child was not autistic or non verbal. If he was, an exception would be made.\n\nI accept I\u2019m TA for terminating with no notice. That wasn\u2019t right.\n\nFinal update/edit: I returned her money for the last few days of January and texted an apology for terminating without notice and said I hope she was able to find care. She said she left him at her mom\u2019s. She also asked if there was anyway I\u2019d reconsider and I said no. We had a long phone call and no minds were changed, but it was the ending we SHOULD have had.",

        "text": "Throwaway because I am a lurker and don\u2019t have an actual Reddit account.\n\nSo, I work for an international company with many different nationalities, recently I have been assigned to a mainly American team (which means I have to work weird hours due to time zones but I\u2019m a single guy with no kids so I can work around that). I live/work in Germany and prior to this team I only used English in writing and spoke German with everyone.\n\nWe had a couple of virtual meetings and I noticed some of the Americans mispronouncing my name - they called me Mr. Birch. So I corrected them, my surname is Bi\u010d (Czech noun meaning \u201ca whip\u201d, happens to be pronounced just like \u201cbitch\u201d). My name is not English and doesn\u2019t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don\u2019t see a problem with my name (and I don\u2019t feel insulted by being called \u201cMr Bitch\u201d), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like \u201ccunt\u201d in Czech, it\u2019s just how it is.\n\nWell apparently the American group I\u2019m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying \u201ccurse words\u201d(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to answer to a different name?\n\nEdit due to common question: using first names is not our company policy due to different cultural customs, for many (me included) using first names with very distant coworkers is not comfortable and the management ruled that using surnames and titles is much more suitable for professional environment. I am aware that using first names is common in the USA, please mind that while the company is international, the US office is just one of the branches.\n\nEdit 2: many people are telling me to suck it up and change my name or the pronunciation, because many American immigrants did that. So I just want to remind you: I am not an immigrant. I do not live in the US nor do I intend to. I deal with 10ish Americans in video calls and a few dozen in email communication. Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.\n\nEdit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bi\u010d, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it\u2019s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn\u2019t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office\u2019s official language. Nobody has issues with Bi\u010d when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)\n\nEdit4: last edit. Dear Americans, I know you use first names in business/work environment. Please please please understand that the rest of the world is not America. Simply using English for convenience sake does not mean we have to follow specific American customs.",

        "text": "I'm still angry over this and I may not write very well, and also I probably don't judge the situation very well being this angry so I came to you.\n\nI'm a student. I have a student bank account, where my college gives me money for transport (when we had physical classes) or scholarship. These kind of bank accounts have no fees, but are age restricted (can't have one if you're over 25) and need an overseer. When I asked the bank about it, they told me it's just a security thing so I chosen mom because she's more tech savvy than dad.\n\nWell through some incredible luck I managed to get only top grades last year so I was awarded a study scholarship. Great! I've been saving it up, looking forward to word wide Black Friday, eyeing an amazing drawing tablet. I do digital art on very old intros, the tablet I was eyeing is as big as my monitor, is a display one and all around amazing.\n\nBlack Friday rolls in, and Amazon Germany (closest to me) has it in stock at an amazing price! A price I could afford! I was so damn happy, I ordered it. \n\nThen I got a notice that the bank refused the card. I emailed Amazon (their customer service is so fast) and we went over the card details and such making sure it was alright. It was and they advised me to call my bank. \n\nIt was odd, I had bought things online in the past with this card and it went through. I had enough money for it (even extra) so I thought maybe they had technical difficulties. But it was too late in the day to call and they don't work weekends, so I left an email.\n\nOnly to find out today that for \"big transactions\" they ask for agreement from the overseer and that mine cancelled the transfer. I was like wtf and confronted mom about it (who throughout the weekend acted oblivious) and she told me that of course she couldn't let me \"throw money on something I don't need\" and that \"I wouldn't have money for Christmas presents if I bought that\". Then she had the audacity to ask me what I was planning to get my family this year.\n\nI told her that they won't get anything more than a bread shadow* from me and I went to my room and cried on the carpet. I missed out on the offer, I can't afford the tablet anymore and it's all because mom wanted Christmas gifts. And no, I won't get her anything. Last year she got me a blouse too small for me that she later took for herself. She can gift herself this year too.\n\n*Bread shadow= expression for nothing in my language\n\nEdit: there are so many comments and I thank you all, I'm trying to reply to all of you but it'll take a while\n\nEdit 2: thank you so so much for people offering me money in comments and dm but I can't accept that. I'm really grateful for you trying to help but I really can't take that. I'm really thankful for the offers and advice\n\n#Edit 3: all hail u/Epic-Hamster!\n\nSo many people offered me advice, money, their tablets or other means of helping and I'm really thankful to you all! Also, lots of you told me to check the sale that's going on right now but the tablet I ordered wasn't on sale, yet u/Epic-Hamster found it (same specs different seller) at sale at an even better price than the Black Friday sale! I ordered it, it went through this time, and I'm so happy and excited!\n\nThank you, from all of my heart to everyone. I'm still going to reply to all of you, even if it's going to take me all night. Happy holidays for all of you!\n\nEdit: it seems like I can't reply to you guys anymore sadly but if you want to you can send me a pm, I don't think I'll sleep this night anyway\n\n#FAQ\n\n(Now I really get why these are called frequently asked questions)\n\n\u2022 This account I have to have because of my Uni, but I'm going to make dad the overseer and also open an account at another bank (a normal one) and transfer the money in small amounts to that one so I don't bother dad with it\n\n\u2022 Also considering asking him just to be for form and the app to be on my phone so I'll be my own overseer\n\n\u2022 I am an adult in my country, I'm 20, going to be 21 in April. The law asks my parents to support me until I finish my studies or at least until I'm 26, but I plan on moving out sooner\n\n\u2022 I'll do gift my sister and dad, they have nothing to do with the incident and I love them lots\n\n\u2022 I love mom too but can't put up with her attitude any longer\n\n\u2022 Regarding what I'll give her, not sure yet but there are some amazing ideas in the comments\n\n\u2022 She didn't react like that because she got me the tablet already, it's not her character to get me something she can't use. \n\n\u2022 Regarding the gift dad's planning on and which she'll claim is from both of them, dad is going to build a bigger enclosure for my lizard. \n\n\u2022 I may wrap my lizard's old branches nice and gift those to mom, as per Christmas traditions regarding naughty kids. And she doesn't like my scaly boy at all so double points I guess\n\n\u2022 People saying that a drawing tablet is useless, thanks for your input but the question was if I was an A for the way I reacted and my decision to not give her a gift anymore. As it's my money I literary can do whatever I wish with it and a display drawing tablet is incredible useful for an aspiring digital artist as myself.\n\nThank you all who commented, I'll really try to reply to you all but you're so many! Thank you lots!\n\nEdit number I lost count: Glad so many people like the bread shadow! It's a regional Romanian idiom! Would you eat some beans for us on 1st Dec? It's our national day, traditionally celebrated by eating beans with meat but if you're not okay with the meat that's okay too. I love you all!",

        "text": "\nI married my wife Elise 12 years ago. She has a 16 year old daughter (Ana) from her previous relationship and we have a 7 year old son as well. \n\nFrom pretty much the beginning of our relationship, Ana and I have never gotten along. I don\u2019t know how to emphasize that it is NOT because of a lack of trying. She just does not like me. When she was young she was just scared of me and \u201cafraid I\u2019d tear their family apart\u201d. Nowadays it\u2019s more of a neutral dislike rather than strong antipathy so I suppose that\u2019s progress\n\nElise is a stay at home mother, so she relies on me for income. As a result, I pay for everything for Ana. Food. Clothes. Volleyball fees. Field trips. I take an interest in her hobbies. I go to her games. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect but I try my damn hardest to be the step-father I can. \n\nBut it\u2019s so... hard. Always giving me curt 1-word responses. Always having to have an attitude. She does things to get a rise out of me. Staying out late reeking of booze. Always trying to sneak boys in. Typical rebellious stuff. But I always let her know I love her and I\u2019m there for her in hopes of her \u201cshithead teenager\u201d phase pasts. \n\nThe opposite is true for her biological father. She adores him. Can\u2019t tell you why. He never goes to her games, always makes excuses for why he doesn\u2019t want to see her. He forgot her birthday last month and she cried herself to sleep. \n\nWell anyways, Friday, I came to her room to check her phone and read her messages (not a permanent thing, but she\u2019s been caught sneaking out twice in the last month so this is her punishment). I ask for the phone, she says \u201cno, I\u2019m tired of you checking my shit, leave me alone\u201d. I tell her I\u2019m not asking again and she goes \u201cjust fuck off already. You\u2019re not my real dad. You never have been. Stop acting like you can tell me what to do\u201d before getting up and slamming the door. \n\nLike I said guys. I\u2019m tired. Tired of the blantant disrespect. Of being the verbal punching bag while still providing more for her than anyone else in her family. \n\nWe haven\u2019t really talked since until this morning during breakfast. She asked if I could pay for her plane tickets so she could see her boyfriend cross-state. Like I said, her mom doesn\u2019t work and her dad is a POS so I normally would be the one to cough up the money. Not this time. I responded \u201cgo ask your real dad\u201d. I could tell she was hurt. Tears swelled up from her face and she excused herself from the table. \n\nMy wife took me aside later and said my comment was extremely disrespectful. I said if anything\u2019s disrespectful, it\u2019s her treating me like a doormat and a credit card, and I will no longer tolerate this treatment in my house. I told her we don\u2019t have to be friends, but if she can\u2019t at least be cordial to me or respect my position as an authority figure, she can find someone else to pay for her non-essentials. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Just adding a TLDR at the request of a comment. My step-daughter continuously disrepects me and my authority. She told me that \u201cI\u2019m not her real dad\u201d. Later on, she asked me to buy her tickets and I told her to \u201cgo ask her real dad\u201d. AITA?\n\nAnd to add more context, my wife is a saint. She DOES stick up for me when Ana says something rude or snarky. She just said \u201cstooping to her level\u201d was inappropriate. But she\u2019s a wonderful mom and tries her best.",

She is super into essential oils which is very eyeroll inducing for me but I didn\u2019t say anything about it or show that I found it annoying at first. I bit my tongue while she went on about putting them in her water (you should not be ingesting essential oils) and rubbing them on pressure points and trying to convince my mom to buy some. \n\nBut then she brought up that they can be super good for yeast infections!!? I looked at her super horrified and asked \u201cyou mean you\u2019re putting them *down there*??\u201d And she said yes you just insert a few drops and it clears up right away! I told her this was very dangerous and could cause chemical burns as well as throwing off your vaginal ph and potentially causing other infections. She said \u201coh no you don\u2019t have to worry about that they\u2019re all natural!!\u201d To which I replied \u201cso is poison ivy but I wouldn\u2019t suggest shoving it up your vagina.\u201d She just looked kind of shocked. My sister laughed and my aunt said \u201cwell she has a point,\u201d but other family members said that it was rude and crass. Which I didn\u2019t think so because she\u2019s the one who started talking about yeast infections at a family dinner certainly saying the word vagina is less crass than that.",

        "text": "Due to job opportunities, we recently moved into a new neighborhood. While most things were going fairly smoothly, we'd at around 4pm hear a couple of knocks on our door, when we went to see who it was, to our surprise there wasn't anybody there. It was only until a couple weeks later that we thought there could be the possibility of someone doing ding dong ditch. We just never thought of it as everyone here seemed really relaxed, so ding dong ditch never crossed our minds.\n\n\nAs to not resort to any extreme measures, we put up a sign near the door saying to \"please not trouble the peope inside by doing these silly pranks\", which didn't work. Since it didn't work, we resorted to asking people about it, but all i got was that it was some sort of tradition for kids in the neighborhood to do this to the new people in the area.\n\nThis kind of irked me as ding dong ditch is really annoying so i set up a camera inside our house to capture who was outside our door. \n\n\nAfter reviewing the footage multiple times i was able to confirm it was some brat who was a couple metres away. I went to speak to his parents but they laughed it off saying kids will be kids, so i decided that I'd myself do something about it. After 3 days the kid came back, but i was hiding behind an unlocked door with a large water bucket. As soon as he knocked and turned i opened the door and splashed him with water.\n\n I thought that was that but, the kids parents came not even 10 mins later, demanding as to why i soaked their kid in water, i tried to justify my reasoning but to no avail.\n\nIm conflicted/feel like an AH as i myself used a petty way of getting that kid to stop annoying us. I would love to hear your opinions on this as well.",

No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. \n\nI had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. \n\nI have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I\u2019m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I\u2019ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. \n\nWe had two children- two sons. We\u2019d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it\u2019s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. \nHe has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. \n\nMy mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was \u2018time for them to know\u2019. She didn\u2019t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn\u2019t do it in our presence. \n\nSince then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they\u2019ve been prodding their dad asking why we\u2019d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they\u2019re acting like we\u2019ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. \n\nMy 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I\u2019d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. \n\nHe told me that it made \u2018so much sense\u2019 why we were abnormal, why we don\u2019t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. \n\nthe two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children\u2019s lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don\u2019t know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",

A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named \"James\" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break.\n\n\nWe talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).\nJames said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.\n\nFor some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.\nI told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.\n\n\nAITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?\n\nThis was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",

I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. \n\nI was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, \"aww that's sweet of her.\" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. \n\nOne of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. \n\nSo I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, \"That's not okay.\" \n\nNow I feel like absolute shit.

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nHis sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. \n\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\nI told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nSammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nHe accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it\u2019s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you\u2019re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine. But in the real world, people who can\u2019t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don\u2019t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don\u2019t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people\u2019s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub\u2019s judgement of who\u2019s the asshole in a given situation. I don\u2019t know if the disparity is just because of reddit\u2019s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don\u2019t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you\u2019re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you\u2019re an asshole, well\u2026 there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they\u2019re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never seen this movie, but it\u2019s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole\u201d",

        "text": "I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",

        "text": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

She stays with us instead of a hotel, and always wants to go to expensive restaurants. She always conveniently forgets her wallet, or domes up with some excuses as to why she can\u2019t pay her share. She has implied that since I make much more money than her, I should be the one to pay (no, not my husband should pay, but me *specifically*). I do make a fair amount of money, but not so much that I can treat someone every time they come into town. Nonetheless, in the past, I have just paid the bill and asked her to pay me back. She never has. \n\nShe had made a reservation at an extremely expensive restaurant last night, and before we left, I made it clear that I wouldn\u2019t be paying her bill. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole, and I\u2019ll admit I got this move straight from and episode of Two and a Half men. As we were leaving, her and my husband went to the car. I pretended I forgot something and went back inside. I found her wallet sitting right on top of her suitcase. I put it in my purse and we went to the restaurant.\n\nWhen we were done eating, I asked for separate bills. She said no, we need one bill, because she \u201cforgot\u201d her wallet again. I reached in my purse and said, \u201cthis wallet?\u201d \n\nShe was extremely furious. She said that I should not have touched or grabbed her wallet. \n\nSo AITA for taking her wallet and bringing it to the restaurant?\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Jeez lol! So many comments that I can\u2019t keep up, but thank you to everyone who had something to say.\n\nEdit 2: Amy just called me, she saw this post and she yelled at me for \"badmouthing\" her on the internet. Honestly I don't care. Amy, hopefully reading all these comments is a wake up call for you.",

And I\u2019m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \n\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI\u2019m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven\u2019t reached out to any of Marcy\u2019s family and I don\u2019t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. \n\nThat\u2019s it. Take care everyone.",

        "text": "I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: \n\nJames - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n\nAITA for this joke?",

I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. \n\nMy fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  \n\nIt is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  \n\nSo we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  \n\nAt dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  \n\nI have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  \n\nSo I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  \n\nMy mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  \n\nSo I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  \n\nI already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23\" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. \n\nThe subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.\n\nMy parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.  \n\nAITA?",

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n\n\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit. Love you, all!\"",

Madeline\u2019s father died before she was born. \n \nMadeline is currently 15, and she\u2019s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad. I don\u2019t have to follow you\u201d. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn\u2019t mean it, and that she\u2019d probably change. I just replied \u201cI\u2019m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.\u201d \n \nThat happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I need food.\u201d I decide to be extremely cheeky and say \u201cHi Hungry, I\u2019m not your dad.\u201d My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me \u201cNot to stoop down to her level.\u201d \n \nI honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?\n \nEdit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.\n\n \nMini Update: I\u2019ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter\u2019s room after dinner and begin talking with her. \u201cHey. I\u2019m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I\u2019m legally your dad, so we\u2019re stuck together. But seriously, I\u2019m going to love you like my daughter even if you don\u2019t think I\u2019m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that\u2019s good.",

I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \n\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he\u2019s a virgin and she didn\u2019t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn\u2019t need to be made fun of like this.\n\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it\u2019s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn\u2019t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\n\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems.

While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. \n\nWhen we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. \n\nEncouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our \u201cthrow-away\u201d consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don\u2019t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. \n\nPlease think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts.

        "text": "About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, \u201cMake sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!\u201d as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. \n\nI told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. \n\nThat night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the \u201cpunishment didn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it\u2019s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",

        "text": "Hello!.\n\n\nI don't know where to begin...it's been an absolute nightmare recently. And I feel like I was losing my sanity.\n\nSo for more details about my situation. I have to admit that my husband's mom favors him over all his siblings. this affected his relationship with them and me as well. He's never seen an issue with how differently his mom treats him, it bothered me and made me feel uncomfortable. The whole dynamic made me feel uncomfortable. Going Low contact has never even been an option. Like he has to see her or call her everyday.\n\nMost of his siblings don't talk to him and I 100% believe it's because of his mom's favoritism like I said. He does bare some blame for not seeing how wrong this is til this day.\n\nIn many instances I found myself making excuses for his behavior. Even in my post. I did it spontaniously and I don't know why. But I guess it's because of how much I love him and because I really really wanted to be able to work things this type of things out without letting them affect our marriage.\n\n\nregarding what happened with the trip, He tried to have a talk with me and most of what he said came from place of blame,  Blame towards me. I just couldn't continue with this argument. I told him I needed space and that I would be going to stay with my sister for a while. He didn't take it well, he literally got up from the couch and opened the door telling me to go right then. In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time. His mom can do no wrong. I'm always the aggressive, crazy, jealous, pathetic, overreactor.\n\nAll these people's opinions, advice and concerns were like a spark...like the wake up call I really needed. Though I wish that it didn't get this far but what's done is done.\n\n\nRight now I'm staying with my sister (I brought my dog with me as well) He sent me his last message telling I'm the one choosing to end what we had together but I believe it's the other way around, especially with how he keeps making his mom the victim in this situation. It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm not mad at him and don't expect him to change but...at least I'm given options to decide what's best for me and my future even if it's seperation and divorce.\n\nA big thank you to those who reached out with resources that I feel very very lucky to have come across. Just wanted to give you an update since many of you asked for it.",

This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan. \n\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. \n\nfrankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

        "text": "I was asked for an update on /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g31n1q/wibta_for_planting_prickly_bushes_in_my_front/\n\nAbout a week after my post I planted a 'wall' of blackberries and raspberries at the 2 sides of my garden facing the driveway, about 30 cm from the edge so no overhanging branches! On the other side of the berry wall I planted lots stuff like strawberries and tomatoes. To reach the tomatoes and strawberries from the driveway you have either go through the fruitbushes or walk up to my house, walk about 2m along the side of the house and my windows and then walk into my actual garden. Not something you do by mistake.\n\nFor about 2 weeks it was somewhat quiet but I still found the kids on my driveway every single days. As far as I know they did not enter the garden and I hadn't noticed them walking around my house anymore, so I figured the bushes were working.\n\nAbout 1 week ago berry season started and my bushes are now full of raspberries and there's lots of strawberries as well. The neighbours noticed. First I caught the boys picking and eating raspberries so I told them off and dropped them off at home, told their mom I caught them stealing (that's how I see it even though it's fruit) and that I'd call the cops next time. She huffed and told me to grow up, but took the boys inside anyway.\n\nAfter that it was quiet up until yesterday afternoon, when I went out for a while and found the dad and his 2 sons right in the middle of my garden when I returned, clearing my bushes and plants. I didn't even confront them, just called the cops from a distance as they hadn't noticed me yet and started filming them after making the call. Luckily 2 cops showed up after 10 minutes or so and they confronted the neighbour as they were still picking berries. They told them they were trespassing and that the berry picking was in fact considered stealing and that I could press charges. For the first time I noticed a bit of fear in my neighbour, he was having trouble finding his words and kept looking back at his house (I guess hoping his wife would show to yell at the cops). They all went inside with the cops, so I just went home as well.\n\nAfter a while the cops came by and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked them if they felt like they scared the neighbour enough to stay away. I got a small smile and yes about him, but the wife had just kept shouting at them and her husband about the 'little bitch' living next door. I told them no for now, asked them if I'd be allowed to get an extra camera set up on the wall between my garden and the road to cover the entire front garden + driveway, they said that's allowed as long as it's on my side of the wall.\n\nSo, now I'm getting an extra camera installed, one neighbour knows I'm done messing around but his wife isn't there yet and if I ever catch any of them again, the cops will be called and possible charges will follow.",

        "text": "I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes \"what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH\" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. \n\nI was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like \"Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls\"\n\nHe was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said \"you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it\"\n\nI just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying \"what's for dinner tonight b*tch\" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. \n\nI thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the \"joke\", it was still disrespectful. \n\nBut it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. \n\nThe next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.\n\n\"Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night\"\n\nHe called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. \n\nI told him \"yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch\" \n\nHe told me he didn't and it was just a \"trend\" and I got pissed off he was playing that \"TikTok trend\" BS excuse again and I told him \"Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!\" \n\nHe got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us\n\nAITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me \"what's for dinner tonight, b*tch\"\n\nEdit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:\n\n> \"But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?\"\n\nHonestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. \n\nThis isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like \"Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)\"\n\nAnd if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT \"UNDERSTAND\"",

Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her house\nI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet).\n\n\nMy sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.\nonly because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.\nI've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future.\n\n\nI refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.\nMy aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now. \n\nShe's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.\n\n\n\nSo, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say \"FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her\".\n\nThings got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there \"anyway\" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.\n\nI went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.\n\nDid I really overreact?",

He never says any hurtful words but I find his \"observations\" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say \"oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though...\" or when he looks at my waist and says \"Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!\". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.\n\n\n\nWe went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said \"I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!\". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!\". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an \"observation\" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.\n\n\n\nNow I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity.

For the no call/no show, and also for her reaction to my response. She admitted that she knows I'm not sexist, or \"ableist\" (IDK if I spelled that right, there's a red line under it), and explained that she was lashing out due to her mental state.\n\nI accepted her apology, and offered one of my own. Both for giving her too much responsibility too quickly, and also for reacting out of emotion.\n\nShe explained to me that she had a major issue on Monday, and without getting into too much detail, I'll just say that it was the anniversary of a bad thing.\n\nShe's taking all of her accumulated PTO (~9 weeks), and we've agreed that going forward, I'm not going to put her on the schedule on that day ever again.\n\nShe's admitted that she's not up to the role of manager. When she returns, she will be in the role of lead cashier, a role I created specifically for her. This way she can keep her raise, and not feel like she got a \"demotion\", but rather a lateral transfer. I've also let her know that if she ever feels like she's up to more responsibility, she can let me know, and I'll put her right back on track for the manager spot.\n\nI've also let her know that if she's ever in a position where she's not able to call out, she can simply text me a thumbs down emoji, and I will accept that as notice that she will be missing her next shift. She's agreed that that will be ok, even when she's \"out of spoons\".\n\nI appreciate all of the ~6000 comments my post got, even the ones calling me TA. Thank you all very much. I want to specifically address the folks who explained \"spoon theory\" to me, as well as those who commented about \"peter principle\", those two types of comments very heavily influenced my actions. I was able to better understand both her issue, and my own failures as a leader because of those comments.\n\nHopefully we can both move forward from this unfortunate incident and end up better for it.",

I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.\n\n\nI noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.\n\n\nFor NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my \" inheritance pocket\" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.\n\n\nHe got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.\n\n\nHe is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.\n\n\nAITA?",

I had a few folks message me over the last couple of months, the latest tonight. I touches me that so many of you still message me to see if things are going well, so I wanted to update people en masse.\n\nLife is going phenomenally. I axed the friend group, and have since been kicking butt. I realized that if my close friend group was consistently putting me down or taking advantage of me, who else could be. The biggest answer was myself. I stopped doing things I enjoyed to invest in people that took joy in hurting me (Turns out it went so much deeper than gas lighting).\n\nI got two new hobbies, wood working and brewing. I absolutely love them both, and have made friends in those communities. I started cooking instead of take out and I met the woman who is now my girlfriend at the local market and we do most things together now. I realized my job had been taking a huge advantage over me. I worked significantly harder and longer hours for less pay than the employees under me.\n\nAfter I transitioned to taking better care of myself I successfully created a resume that outlined my successes (Recognizing those successes took quite a bit of effort!) and got a new job in higher management for significantly more pay. I'm also going to buy a house this December with a yard for my dog and I. Nothing big, just a nice one bedroom with a large yard for my buddy and I to play fetch in.\n\nSo thanks Reddit. Owe you one. Never would have made life improvement if it weren't for an external force.",

        "text": "So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn\u2019t lift a finger to go visit her. \n\nI tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. \n\nHe said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. \n\nLast week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we\u2019re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she\u2019s upset it didn\u2019t work out but these things happen, so we\u2019re on good terms) and looks like she\u2019s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. \n\nI confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. \n\nWife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible. \n\nAITA? I stand by what I said.",

        "text": "**TL;DR at bottom**\n\nFor context: I've been married to my wife for ~10 years and we're a mixed-race couple (I'm Asian and she's Caucasian). I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me.\n\nI'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain.\n\nWhenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like \"Umm, I think you should actually do X like this...\". I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like \"Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it.\"\n\nThings came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like \"Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things\". It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said \"making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count\". The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled \"SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU\". I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her \"a racist piece of shit\", apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife.\n\nApparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying \"it was a joke but kind of true\" and that I was \"being too sensitive\". The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism.\n\nAITA?\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it \"making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant\". Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do?\n\n**EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me)\n\n**EDIT2/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going \"This is you right?...\". Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like \"If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed\". I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear\n\n**EDIT3/UPDATE2:** Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that \"[my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point\" and threatened a \"world of hurt\" if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks\n\n**EDIT4/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down*\n\n1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of \"[her] {Asian slur} husband\". Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...\n2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.\n3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in.\n\nSuffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear\n\n[Me right now](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv)\n\nI think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks\n\n**EDIT5/UPDATE4:**\n\nTurns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:\n> No, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this.\n\n*I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)*\n\nSuffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it \"Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much\"). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs.\n\nWe didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything.\n\n\n**FIL (aka Doug)**\n\nApparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the \"Kung Pao Incident\" and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town).\n\n\n**Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)**\n\nYou may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though.\n\n\n**Sarah / SIL**\n\nAccording to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She\u2019s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her).\n\n\nIt sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading. \n\n[Still me right now.](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv)",

I\u2019m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn\u2019t allowed to apply for college.\n\nI did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn\u2019t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought \u201cthem\u201d for college.

They wouldn\u2019t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn\u2019t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn\u2019t being serious and I just left. Since then, I\u2019ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I\u2019m being immature and hurtful.

Up until last week, things were perfect between us. \n\nHowever, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says \"but I didn't\". \n\nWhen she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd \"threatened\" to do it before (I literally just said \"okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything\" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way.

        "text": "The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \"expect\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \"grounded\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her \"slave\" for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/Update kinda:\n\nWow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. ",

        "text": "Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don\u2019t split costs on is groceries. Everyone\u2019s in charge of buying their own food and we don\u2019t touch whatever doesn\u2019t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. \n\nThis issue has been going on almost a year and I\u2019m sick of it. \n\nOne of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I\u2019ve only drank once or twice. \n\nI confronted R about this lots of times and that\u2019s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I\u2019m crazy even though it\u2019s so obvious. \n\nMy other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s always after we get back home and R\u2019s already left for work that I notice my food\u2019s gone. My roommate\u2019s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I\u2019m guessing cause R doesn\u2019t like what he buys.\n\nThe funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what\u2019s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.\n\nLast week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he\u2019s lactose intolerant. \n\nThe nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with \u201cSo then you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been stealing?\u201d \n\nHe freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was \u201csometimes\u201d drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn\u2019t have done that if he\u2019d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.\n\nMy roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It\u2019s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we\u2019re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  \n\nI told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I\u2019m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",

Hard to explain but I\u2019m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won\u2019t necessarily trust my parents with. \n\nAnyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it\u2019s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said \u2018maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky\u2019 \n\nI saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call.

        "text": "My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move.\n\nIn the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH\"s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. \n\nI have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.\n\nShe said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more \"girly\". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH\"s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. \n\nI paid for all the dresses. \n\nFast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.\n\nSo fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. \n\nI confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. \n\nThe wedding went on and it was truly amazing.\n\nEver since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",

It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n",

It\u2019s been a good 2 weeks since I\u2019ve posted and I figured you guys would like an update. A lot has happened since the last time I posted\n\nSo that night, I did what many of the comments suggested I do, which was to apologize. I told her that I\u2019m sorry that implying that I\u2019m not her real father, but like it or not that I consider her MY daughter. That I loved her and will always be there for her. She started to cry and sob uncontrollably and said \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he [her biological father] love me?\u201d I held her and told her she didn\u2019t need to fight for his approval. I also apologized for looking through her phone; that I\u2019ve come to accept that it\u2019s not an appropriate punishment for a teenage girl, and I was going to find other alternatives. Lastly I brought up therapy and while she was hesitant at first I let her know it was nothing to be ashamed of, that everything she said at therapy would be entirely confidential, and that it could help to have a confidant to help her sort through her feelings. She sat on this for the day, but the next day let me know that she was ready so I set up the soonest appointment (which was last Friday and her second appointment this afternoon)\n\nIt\u2019s only been a week so I don\u2019t want to get too optimistic but honestly I feel like I\u2019m noticing an improvement already. She\u2019s actually been engaging back in small talk when normally she wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day. She\u2019s been following all of the rules, coming home at a reasonable hour, she\u2019s been less withdrawn and more social even to the point where her brother commented on the change today! But the most exciting news of them all is when getting out the car on her way home from therapy, she said and I quote \u201cthanks dad\u201d. She\u2019s never called me dad before so honestly I\u2019ve been riding off that high for the last two hours \n\nI\u2019m not delusional enough to think everything\u2019s peachy but honestly the behavior change in the last week was the most progress we\u2019ve had since, well, ever. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic going forward. \n\nThanks again everyone for your comments, especially the ones who gave me the kick in the ass I needed.",

        "text": "My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n\n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n\n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n\n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n\n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",

        "text": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.\n\nThis year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.\n\nMy parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.\n\nNow my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.\n\nEdit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.\n\nUpdate: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.\n\nSmol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying \"Nope!\" to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work. \n\nThank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

I never EVER should have called her lazy because that isn't what she is. I lashed out and I shouldn't have.\n\nShe stayed at her mothers for a few days, and we eventually met up to talk. I told her how it just got too much for me, but it was no excuse for lashing out and I apologised. She apologised also, not that she needed to, and we talked for a long while about how we can make our relationship work.\n\nI expressed my concerns over her therapist who is very against anything other than talking therapy. She agreed that he didn't seem to really have her best interests at heart and she is currently looking for someone new.\n\nFor now, I suggested she stops looking for work. She got a lot of rejections and I could see it was upsetting her more. I just felt we should take a step back from that and I want her to focus a little more on herself. She was unsure as she felt bad that I would be working for both of us, but I assured her it is fine. (I make enough to support us both quite comfortably). I also suggested maybe she could volunteer at some point just to get her out and get some more stuff on her resume. I'm no therapist so these were just suggestions, but it has seemed to have taken some of the pressure off her which is all I wanted. \n\nWe agreed that being in the apartment all day alone and in bed is not good for her. So, we came up with a plan that she do an exercise video 3 times a week (it's only a 10 minute one), just so she is doing something. She has found she likes doing them, they make her feel a bit better after, and has started something called Yin Yoga now too.\n\nTo help me, she has ONE chore a day to do. I don't care what it is. It could be dishes or it could just be putting the laundry in the hamper. This rule has at least gotten her out of bed for part of the day and she's found that once she starts she sometimes ends up doing more than one thing. I make sure to show my appreciation for whatever she has done, no matter how small it was. \n\nWe have set out that every sunday we will have a deep cleaning day where we get everything done for the week. This has been surprisingly successful. We make it fun and just mess around while still getting things done. It makes the week a lot more manageable when we only have light chores to keep on top of.\n\nShe is trying more, and I am also working on being more supportive about her depression. I'm researching it more, and learning ways I can help her because it is a part of her. We are both putting more effort in and communicating a lot better.\n\nI hope we keep making progress because I do love her very much and want us to work.",

I was scared I'd lose him but also felt I would be deceiving him by not telling him, thus making the investment in our relationship unfair. The comments were pretty much unanimous in that I'm an asshole, and I needed to tell him, and this validated my decision to go forth and be honest, as nervous as I was.\n\nI explained my situation about taking 2 yrs to come to this decision, how my fertility clinic had shut due to Covid which was why I had gone back onto dating apps. I explained how my clinic had reopened after meeting him, and how important it was to me to continue in my journey to become a mother. I knew this was 'baggage' he hadn't expected and that there was every chance he would step away from the situation. Well, he didn't.\n\nWe're now in a committed relationship and he's been supporting me in my journey. I've had 2 unsuccessful artificial inseminations with donor sperm (my original plan), and we've spoken about having a child together. As early on as it may seem, he told me my honesty made him consider his own future and how he really wants a family some day, and how he has admiration for me being honest about my situation and how he wants to help my fulfil my desires to be a mother, whether with him or with donor sperm - either way he wants to be a part of my life.\n\nI wanted to provide this update as a positive outcome has come out of being labelled an asshole and it pushed me to do the right thing, which has in turn meant I have the most understanding and accepting bf. Had I kept this info from him it would have played on my conscience, as well as most likely have caused him to not trust me. So thank you : )  \n\n\nEDIT - Gosh, I didn't think this post would blow up in this way. Thanks for the lovely words of support, and also those of you taking the time to provide food for thought of co-parenting and step-parenting. This is new territory for me, and I don't know anyone else in my day to day life who has been in this situation, so it's so valuable for me to hear your views and gain new perspectives. Thank you, kind Reddit community.",

It\u2019s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they\u2019ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it\u2019s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cRick\u201d were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on & off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are.\n\nNow my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn\u2019t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it\u2019s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don\u2019t have actual confirmation if that\u2019s exactly what he was told. All Carla\u2019s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he\u2019s angry at her for never saying anything. \n\nIt became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they\u2019re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place. \n\nRick said so to and in my mind I\u2019m going \u201che doesn\u2019t want the guy who dated his fianc\u00e9e  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.\u201d My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They\u2019re going to have to find some place else since we\u2019re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Rick doesn\u2019t want me around because he\u2019s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I\u2019ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I\u2019m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don\u2019t think that I am, it just doesn\u2019t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we\u2019re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it\u2019s the least I can do after everything. AITA?",

He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.\n\nHowever, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.\n\nI've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.\n\nVictoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'\n\nShe looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?\n\nEdit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

        "text": "Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fianc\u00e9 Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. \n\n\nThe problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn\u2019t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have \u201cblamed\u201d me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. \n\n\nI\u2019ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I\u2019ve explained that there\u2019s no chance we will ever get back together. \n\n\nSo tonight I go over to my mom\u2019s place because she\u2019s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I\u2019m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it\u2019s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. \n\n\nI\u2019m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. \n\n\nMy mom called a short while ago saying she\u2019s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she\u2019s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn\u2019t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",

He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always \"I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?\".\n\n\nLast week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.\n\n\n\nHe texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.\n\n\nHe's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.\n\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.",

No hate towards children just to keep it more organized and contained.\n\n\nMy brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls \"miracle\" or \"rainbow\" baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years. \n\nWhen they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring \"blessings\" for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop.\n\n\nMy brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase \"the wedding is childfree, period\" and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order: \n\n- The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom). \n\n- Is Child (with a sticker of a baby). \n\n- FREEE (with a sticker of a \ud83d\udeab sign). \n\n- PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker). \n\nThey both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure. They're telling everyone about the amount of disrespect and mockery I had displayed towards them and I'm being told to \"fix it\" now.",

        "text": "Ok this is the worst. I\u2019m losing sleep over this.\n\nI\u2019m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.\n\nMy brother is gay, but my family doesn\u2019t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century\u2019s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.\n\nSo my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I\u2019m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it\u2019s kind of a secret, as he hasn\u2019t told my family he is gay.\n\nI\u2019ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.\n\nBut he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won\u2019t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn\u2019t accept my brother being gay.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s his decision not mine, so for now he won\u2019t say anything.\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.\n\nIf it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don\u2019t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don\u2019t want to get the attention away from my fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good reason\n\nI asked him why my wedding day, he said it\u2019s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can\u2019t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. \n\nI didn\u2019t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse\n\nWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.\n\nNext day I got a text and he said \u201c dont worry, going alone\u201d. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s happening because they didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nHe eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us\n\nThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?\n\nPS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\n\nPS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!\n\nUpdate: spoke to fianc\u00e9e, couldn\u2019t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.\n\nClarification: I know it won\u2019t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn\u2019t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don\u2019t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother\u2019s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.",

C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She\u2019s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.\n\nI have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.\n\nE and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she\u2019s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time. When C went to grab her third helping of mashed potatoes, A said \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve eaten enough, you fat pig?\u201d C started sobbing immediately and ran off into the bedroom. I felt my face turn red and told A to get out. \n\nAbout half an hour after A left I texted her stating that I would no longer pay her tuition unless 1. She apologized to C and 2. C accepts her apology. A must have assumed that I was bluffing because she instead doubled down on her behavior during Thanksgiving dinner. I then logged into her university\u2019s tuition payment website, canceled next semester\u2019s tuition, and sent A the screenshots. She called me crying and begging me to reconsider but I told her my mind was made up.",

I wanted to give an update on the situation since a lot of people were really concerned for me.\n\nAfter the whole debacle, I did purchase a wedge for under my door from Walmart . It worked, and I didn\u2019t have anymore issues with waking up to people in my face. I used the excuse that it was to keep our cat from opening my door at night and my mom seemed fine with that.\n\nWhile E was here and even after he was gone my mom seemed detached and sort of out of it. I asked if everything was okay and she said she needed to sort out some feelings first but she promised we\u2019d talk when she was better. I said okay and left it at that. \n\nCouple days later, E came back for another weekend stay. The day after he came they had an at home date night with drinks and fancy takeout, and that night I woke up to my door being messed with. I call out to see if it\u2019s my mom, and got no response. I pulled on a t-shirt n shorts and pull the door wedge out to check, and E is standing at my door. He was drunk, and I was a bit panicked because I thought something had happened to my mom and he needed help, but he just stood there for a few seconds without saying anything. He didn\u2019t seem to be sleepwalking or in peril so I said \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable, I\u2019m closing my door.\u201d\n\nBefore I could close the door all the way, my mom flew out her room, saw him, and started cussing and screaming and telling him he needed to leave. They argued back and forth for a while but eventually she got him out the door. After calming her down I took her to her room and we had a talk. \n\nIt turns out, the day she had came into my room, she had been on his phone and saw he was talking to his brother in law about me in very disgusting ways, talking about how I was growing up to be very shapely and mature, and that he couldn\u2019t wait until I moved out so he could dump my mother for me. He said far more explicit things that were all extremely worrying, especially since we\u2019ve known him since I was 11. My mom had came to tell me to be careful around him while she thought of a way to break it off safely, but when she saw my state she had some misplaced anger. He\u2019s out of our lives now, thankfully. \n\nTL;DR: boyfriend was actually a creep, mom had misplaced anger.\n\nI wanna say thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and recommendations, and even those who suggested my mom could be abusive (I plan to talk to her about her other ideals/behaviors soon). Sarcastic thanks and genuinely big \u201cfuck you\u201ds to those who sent me crude messages. I\u2019m just glad the situation is over.",

Before me he was together with his HS sweetheart. They fell out of love and broke up. A year later we started dating. His mom however was still heartbroken about it. I was very understanding and thought she needed time to get to know me. The ex basically grew up with them and they saw her as a part of the family. \n\nFor the first year of my relationship his mom would call me ex\u2019s name, until bf got angry once and told her to be nice. She laughed it off and said it was just a habit. After that she started calling me the wrong name. (Janet instead of Jenny; fictional names just for the story). I corrected her a couple of times but she seemed to like hurting me so I ignored it later.\n\nMy bf has two sisters and a couple of weeks before thanksgiving we were invited to bbq at the older sister\u2019s house. I was in the kitchen with my bf\u2019s mom, the sisters and one of their husbands. The older sister then talked about how my BF praised my cooking to her husband and the mom was listening. She then said iut loud \u201cSURE! Why don\u2019t we let Janet make the turkey this year?\u201d. The sisters giggled and looked at each other and I said \u201cthats a great idea!\u201d I didn\u2019t tell my bf what happened.\n\nOn thanksgiving we went to his mom\u2019s house with the usual wine and dessert. She was shocked l, everybody was shocked. I said \u201cwhat? I thought Janet is bringing the turkey!\u201d. There was yelling, crying and then we got kicked out. My bf is so angry with me he hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I think it\u2019s over tbh. But I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong! Did I?",

        "text": "I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.\n\nThe pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week. \n\nWhen I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. \nI started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it \"wasn't that bad\". My reply was \"fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up.\" Completly exhausted\nI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.\n\nThe following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  \n\nWhen my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.\n\nThat lead to a fight where I told him. \"I am too sick to have company and they need to leave\".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.\n\nMy mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. \"Since your family can stay so can we.\" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.\n\nI got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.\n\nEdited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.\nMy house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.\n\nMy BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.\n\nSIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. \nLast little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight. \n\nMy mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.\nBoth moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.\n\nTalk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.\nBil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.\nSince then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. \nHe admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. \nHe begged me for another chance. \nThe next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita.\n We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.\n\nUpdate on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).\n\n\nWhile I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.\n\n\nETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.\n\nAlso. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.\n\n\n\nETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.\n\nAnd also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

        "text": "So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.\n\nI'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to \"Bob\" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.\n\nNow after I moved out, she started complaining how \"She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!\" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.\n\nAnyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: \"I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.\"\n\nI was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.\n\nMy sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.\n\nSo AITA here?\n\nEdit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",

In our culture education for women is not really valued and she thought that was bullshit. \n\nShe lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could. \n\nWhen she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could. \n\nMy parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. \n\nWhen I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. \n\nI asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks. \n\nI am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest. \n\nMy brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.  \n\nI am somewhat ashamed to be doing this but I don't want to have this debt I should not have.",

        "text": "\n\nI (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.\n\nAs mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept \"attitude\" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.\n\nI ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",

She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say.\n\n\nMy husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her.\n\n\nDays gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily \"called me out\" on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her \"didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!\" She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family.\n\nAITA?\n\nEta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

        "text": "**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** \n\nMy dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she\u2019s started seeing. I\u2019m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone\u2019s favourite uncle. And while i\u2019m glad everyone else is comfortable, i\u2019m not. \n\nHe isn\u2019t a bad guy, I\u2019m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he\u2019s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn\u2019t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it\u2019s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it\u2019s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren\u2019t lacking for anything but he thinks it\u2019s only fair because ~family~. \n\nI live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there\u2019s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it\u2019s pretty separate. \n\nSo last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren\u2019t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. \n\nTonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and \u201cpossible loss of car privileges.\u201d\n\nI snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i\u2019m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i\u2019m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won\u2019t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won\u2019t want to have a relationship with him. \n\nHe told my family and they think i\u2019m the asshole.

He\u2019s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it\u2019ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of \u201cauditioning\u201d to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she\u2019s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she\u2019s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nI was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could\u2019ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn\u2019t bought her a single gift since they\u2019ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. \n\n\nHe confronted her and said he thinks she\u2019s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He\u2019s upset about the \u201cgold digging bitch\u201d and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what\u2019s it\u2019s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he\u2019s delusional as hell. If he doesn\u2019t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he\u2019s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his \u201ctest\u201d.",

        "text": "**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \"mistakes can happen.\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

        "text": "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\nEditing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

        "text": "My wife and I bought a four bedroom house in PA that my son lives in.  Our son went to College in PA and wanted to stay in the area.  So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together. \n\nWe pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.  \n\nNow for the problem: The wedding !!! \n\nWe hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fianc\u00e9 and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fianc\u00e9 go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fianc\u00e9 along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told \"We're not their kind of people\".  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.  \n\nI let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fianc\u00e9.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale. \n\nThey call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted. \n\nAm I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",

        "text": "# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. \n\n**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!\n\n**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**\n\n> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. \n\n> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)\n\n> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)\n\n> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. \n\n**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**\n\n> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?\n\n> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). \n\n\n**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**\n\n\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n------\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n\n# Original Thread Info\n\nHey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). \n\nWe think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered \"top\" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub. \n\n---\n\n# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode\n\nFor the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be \"Best\" instead. \n\n**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",

I gave my mother a few days to calm herself down before speaking to her again, she eventually came around. She recognises that it's not optimal for my son to stay with her and that he would be better with my aunt. She knows that my brother is a slob and is giving him a good kick up the arse to get his life together and shit. I have spoken with a lawyer who has helped me with a lot of things including getting my son legally adopted by my aunt and her husband. He will still be staying with me until i... pass\nAs a lot of you suggested I made recordings and videos of myself giving him advice for his milestones. For example: when he looses his first tooth, turning the ages 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, his first girlfriend(or boyfriend if he likes, I've made a video in case he is in any way lgbt+) leaving secondary school, going uni, getting married or if he has any kids. There are also things I've put into writing, like how his mother died and that he was supposed to grow up with a twin brother that also sadly passed. I've also had my lawyer help me set up a little trust to will him \u00a340,000(from my girlfriends father when he died, she put the money in a joint bank account that I got when she passed) in case he needs help with university or decides to go travelling. All I have to do now is to enjoy the time I have left with him, I've moved my younger brother into my flat so that there will be someone to find me everyday for when I go.\n\nWhen I'm gone I can at least be comforted by the fact that the son I love so much is being taken care of and that I will see the girl I love again and our other angel I never got to meet.\n\nThank you all again\n\nEdit: this is op's brother writing this edit, he has since died",

On phone format is bad.\n\nI was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.\n\nWe end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\n\nGirl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong. \n\nSo Reddit, ATIA?",

I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\n\r\nWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents.

My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.\n\nA few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). \n\nAfter we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.\n\nThe other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.\n\nMy ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed \"fuck you\", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying \"Look what you did\"\n\nWhen I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",

A cut and a photo with every appointment. I very seldom shoot things other than dogs even if I have a nice set up.\n\nA friend got married a few days ago and wanting to save money, asked if I'd shoot it for them. I told him it's not really my forte but he convinced me by saying he didn't care if they were perfect: they were on a shoestring budget and I agreed to shoot it for $250, which is nothing for a 10 hour event. \n\nOn the day of, I'm driving around following the bride as she goes from appointment to appointment before the ceremony, taking photos along the way. I shoot the ceremony itself, and during the reception I'm shooting speeches and people mingling.\n\nI started around 11am and was due to finish around 7:30pm. Around 5pm, food is being served and I was told I cannot stop to eat because I need to be photographer; in fact, they didn't save me a spot at any table. I'm getting tired and at this point kinda regretting doing this for next to nothing. It's also unbelievably hot: the venue is in an old veteran's legion and it's like 110F and there's no AC.\n\nI told the groom I need to take off for 20min to get something to eat and drink. There's no open bar or anything, I can't even get water and my two water bottles are long empty. He tells me I need to either be photographer, or leave without pay. With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if he was sure, and he said yes, so I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I'm not his photographer anymore. If I was to be paid $250, honestly at that point I would have paid $250 just for a glass of cold water and somewhere to sit for 5min.\n\nWas I the asshole? They went right on their honeymoon and they've all been off of social media, but a lot of people have been posting on their wall asking about photos with zero responses.",

I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.\n\nMy freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. \n\nAnyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.\n\nI'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything\n\nThen my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.\n\nI said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.\n\nSo I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. \n\nAnd she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.\n\nI said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. \n\nHer husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.\n\nI was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.\n\nMy mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.\n\nAITA for giving that number?",

Well that post really blew up, people on Twitter also chimed in.\n\nWell the night I made the post, I was still in serious denial. I replied to some comments and my denial was perfectly clear for everyone to see. \n\nThe day after I read some more comments and messages I received from everyone. I resorted to the guest room and cried for hours. I read some people tell me that their moms were similar to me and they no longer have relationships with them. That was truly my worst fear, I seriously love my kids more than anything on this planet even if my actions don\u2019t always show it.\n\nI booked a virtual appointment with a phycologist, who diagnosed me with OCD and let me know she would help me. I have since had about 8 sessions with her and she has been a big help. Of course I still have a long way to go but I have been noticing some improvements already.\n\nAs for my daughter, she stayed at my sister\u2019s house and came home a few days later after I told her that there would be major improvements made in my behavior. I sat all the kids down and told them that I have the resources to not be such an overbearing asshole to them anymore.\n\nOne thing I do want to address is the fact that I was usually controlling with my kids, but the incident I wrote about was the one that sent both me and my daughter over the edge. \n\nMe and her are on much better terms. I want to thank Reddit for waking me the hell up to become a better mom and wife. I also want to apologize to anyone who I brought back bad memories to. I want to have relationships with my children until we all grow old and I know so many of you guys don't have that, which breaks my heart but also hearing your stories gave me a big change of heart and are helping me fix my relationships and become a better person.",

        "text": "Quick recap on [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ibbwws/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_the_place_i_bought_with/). I spent several years working as a stripper, at the end of which I was able to buy my own flat. I'd been with my boyfriend for about 18 months, and I'm currently around 3 months pregnant. With the news of the baby incoming, my boyfriend said he wanted me to sell my place so we could use the money to get a new place together, and when I refused he called me irrational. I thought I was TA because of that, plus my sister sided with him.\n\nNow for the update, because a lot of people asked for one. First off, I dumped him. He initially said that he doesn't want to be a parent if we're not a couple, but earlier this week he told me he wants majority custody so not only does he not have to pay child support, but if he gets majority then *I* end up paying *him* (he actually said that was his reasoning). He also runs his own startup, and admitted the startup is basically done for, and he was hoping that when I sold my place I could also put a cash injection into his business with the money, so basically this was all about money for him (and I have extensive documentation of all of this). There's going to be a legal case, but I've gotten legal advice, and it looks like I'll be able to get sole custody, which is what I intend to go for. In the last couple weeks, my sister has doubled down and is trying to get me to fix things with my ex because \"a baby should have a complete family\", so I've not been involving her in my pregnancy, which she is *furious* about. She also told our parents, which *I* am furious about, so we're not speaking right now.\n\nI also want to say thank you to everyone who commented on my first post. When I first posted, between my boyfriend and my sister, I was genuinely convinced I was in the wrong, so to have such an overwhelmingly supportive response really helped me realise that I shouldn't doubt myself so much, and with that realisation, plus everything going on right now, I've decided to go to therapy, which I will be starting next week.\n\nAll in all, the outcome of this is probably going to be me being a single mother in the flat I own. And honestly? Pretty decent outcome.",

I rushed over there just to find her husband locked in his game room playing video games. I asked her why she called me over if he was home and she said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbabysit\u201d because it was his only day off. \n\nSister left, and I started hanging with the kids. I was changing the baby\u2019s diaper and the other kids wanted a snack, I told them to go ask their dad to make them a snack since the baby had a blow out and it was going to take my awhile to clean him up. \n\nWell their dad sent them back upstairs and told them to ask me again. After cleaning the baby up I made the kids a snack and their dad came out to eat and told me not to let the kids interrupt him on his day off. (By the way, he works part time from home, 6 days a week).\n\nI kind of snapped at him and told him it was MY day off too and that he\u2019s a useless f*cking father and husband if his wife has to rely on her teenage sister rather than her own husband. He started telling me I was disrespectful and didn\u2019t understand how hard parenting is, and I told him he clearly doesn\u2019t understand how hard it is either since he considers parenting his own children \u201cbabysitting\u201d. He ended up kicking me out and apparently my sister was forced to come home because he told her she needed to figure it out since I\u2019m her sister. \n\nI feel like I may be the asshole because my sister is mad at me, her husband is mad at me, my mom is mad at me for causing drama, but my dad thinks it\u2019s funny and agrees with me. I definitely didn\u2019t need to call him names but I just hate this guy so much. We have argued about things in the past as well so we already don\u2019t have a great relationship. My sister is saying I need to apologize to him and he is threatening to never let me into the kids lives if I keep disrespecting him.\n\nEdit: wow I was not expecting this response at all. Thank you guys for all your comments, and to the people who messaged me dick pics or to kill myself... what? Why? Lol y\u2019all are crazy. \n\nFor anyone who has asked, no, he does not take care of the kids normally. My sister takes them to daycare during the day and then picks them up on her way home. She is the breadwinner and the primary caretaker. \n\nAlso, I got a few questions of \u201cdoes she pay you?\u201d Not exactly, but she will randomly take me on expensive shopping sprees and will regularly buy things from my Amazon wishlist instead, and I have no problem with this arrangement. I really love those kids and don\u2019t have an issue babysitting them, I love hanging out with them. \n\nI also don\u2019t blame my mother for her being mad at me, just because of the fact that my sisters dumbass husband texted her and apparently told her a much different version of what happened, lol. He told her I was sitting on my phone the whole time being lazy and the kids kept begging me for a snack. \n\nAlso, I did not yell at him in front of his kids. It was a private conversation. \n\nI might post an update but nothing has really happened in the past day so I don\u2019t really have much to say. No one has apologized to anyone yet.",

        "text": "**ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny\n\nBackstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into \"testing\" the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying \"hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!\" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied \"then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language.\" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way. So AITA?",

He convinced her to be a stay at home mom and sell her business by telling her how good of a childhood he had and how happy my marriage was without telling her (which I today found out) that our arrangement was everything everything before 9am and\nAfter 5pm was split 50/50, Sunday was my day off and I was brought out twice a week. \n\n\nOn to the story- on my last visit I noticed my daughter in law was  struggling mentally so I,my sister(55f) and her girlfriend (53) pulled our money together and paid for a spa weekend for them while we\u2019d babysit the kids for her birthday last weekend. \n\nI was preparing on Thursday evening  for the kids to arrive when my dil rang me holding back tears saying they\u2019d won\u2019t be going because my sons friend came to town and he said he wanted to spend the weekend with his friends catching up. I pressed her a little and I\u2019m talking a little about her situation , she came clean about him doing no chores,no date nights and her basically doing all of the child care because \u201cthat\u2019s what stay at home moms do\u201d I was honestly disgusted. I convinced her to drop me off the kids and bring a friend to the spa I even dipped into my savings to give her \u20ac500 to buy herself something nice. When she dropped me off the kids I begged her to tell me were son was after 5 minutes she told me the bar. She left for the spa while I left for the bar (she knew I was going there and knew my sister/my sister in law were taking care of the kids) \n\nHere\u2019s were I might be the asshole I when to the bar were he and his friends were, I sat down next to the Group and asked my son \u201cdid i fail you as a mother or was it your father because we both thought your partner comes before your silly drunk friends\u201d the post is getting long enough but long story short I humiliated him and got myself banned from a bar \n\nMy dil said she will taking the kids to her parents when she gets back tomorrow and my son is calling me an asshole for humiliating him/ sticking my nose in his marriage \nMaybe I should have stayed out i don\u2019t know\n\n\nEdit I just wanted to say I\u2019m heartbroken not by any judgement towards me or my parenting skills but the fact a lot of people are shocked I\u2019m care about my daughter in laws mental health and stood up for her against my sons bad  behaviour I just want to say as a mother my advice is \nTreat your daughter/son/non-binary in laws how you\u2019d want YOUR children to treated.

Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She\u2019s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, \u201cWho\u2019s AJ?\u201d \n\nI ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I\u2019m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it\u2019s no big deal if I hadn\u2019t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated. They told me the style of art I got is called traditional and it\u2019s \u201cpretty trad\u201d for all artists who do that style to do it. I demanded a partial refund and they refused, so I complained to the owner who made the artist give me a full refund. \n\nNow the artist is running a full smear campaign, talking about moving shops, and all kinds of crap. My sister says I\u2019m an asshole for pushing the issue, but I feel like, at the end of the day, I told you exactly what I wanted and you didn\u2019t do that. AITA?",

He said that he will take care of it.\n\nNow, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.\n\nMy husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).\n\nThen he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. \n\nMy BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. \n\nApparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.\n\nSo they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.\n\nI am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.",

I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn\u2019t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn\u2019t reacting. \n\nMy school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I\u2019m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, \u201cAre you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?\u201d \n\nOther people around me fucking laughed, and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn\u2019t going to go to bat for me. \n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I\u2019m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, \u201cI\u2019d be less concerned with what I\u2019m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you\u2019re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can\u2019t afford healthcare.\u201d \n\nOther students nearby told me I went too far because \u201cit wasn\u2019t her fault she was poor\u201d LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?!

After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. \n\nSince having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. \n\nAnyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.\n\nNow my fianc\u00e9 (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. \n\nSo I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.\n\nShe then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.\n\nShe then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should \"honor her\" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. \n\nNow I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said \n\n\"Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?\"\n\nShe started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm \"letting her down\". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. \n\nWell now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.\n\nI'm firm in my decision though, and my fianc\u00e9 is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",

        "text": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.\n\nA week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.\n\nHe asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding.\n\nI trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.\n\nI assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended.\n\nI got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.\n\nThat only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.\n\nI\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.\n\nSo, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?\n\nEdit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy. Everyone was dressed up in funny costumes\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/user/DanWantsDeath/comments/11l42nb/update_aita_for_wearing_a_wedding_dress_to_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

        "text": "This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. \n\nOn Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.\n\nI thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said \"thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!\"\n\n7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. \n\nI got back in the car and said \"let's party,\" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.\n\nShe stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said \"thanks!\" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.\n\nNow I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?",

        "text": "Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.\n\nThis is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.\n\nMe: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?\n\nMy Mom: Nothing.\n\nA long ass pause.\n\nMe: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?\n\nMy Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!\n\nMy dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.\n\nSo later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.\n\nThe conversation ended with this:\n\nSister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)\n\nSo my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.\n\nSo I say my part before leaving.\n\nMe: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.\n\nMy mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-\n\nMe: No.\n\nMy mom: But [me], we really need the money...\n\nMe: That's too bad.\n\nI get up and go off to my room.\n\nSo this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, \"what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!\"\n\nMy mom, who's listening in.\n\n\"You've seen her! She won't listen to us!\"\n\nMe: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.\n\nMy mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.\n\nThat was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.\n\nAs I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents.

        "text": "I [29F] dated a guy Joe (30M) for 3 months before he left me to go back to his ex Kim (30F). Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I\u2019m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he\u2019s still with his girlfriend. \n\nJoe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children\u2019s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. \n\nKim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn\u2019t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn\u2019t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins \u201cthe non-traditional way\u201d and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn\u2019t even invited. She also announced that she\u2019s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren\u2019t hers, and that Joe didn\u2019t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I\u2019m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m definitely getting a lawyer ASAP. Y\u2019all have scared the shit out of me but I\u2019m happy you did.\n\nUPDATE: I never considered that this could\u2019ve happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn\u2019t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn\u2019t my babies home state and I can\u2019t be charged with anything. \nHowever, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don\u2019t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.\n\nUpdate: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there\u2019s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.",

        "text": "This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. \n\nHe and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. \n\nYesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. \n\nBrenda messages the group saying \"maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts\" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. \n\nMe: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol\n\nBrenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband\n\nMe: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important\n\nBrenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. \n\nMe: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single\n\nNow apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I \"mocked her for being single in her 40s\". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. \n\nAITA reddit?\n\nEdit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.\n\nEdit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying \"sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol.\" \n\nHe's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said \"oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.\"",

        "text": "Since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time I ranted about voting on this sub. So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.\n\nYou may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:\n\n* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!\n* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!\n* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.\n\nAs you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)\n\nAlso important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. If you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and GTFO. You have come to the wrong place.\n\nP.S. If you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. Maybe you're not an asshole after all.  \n\n\nEdit:  I see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  I suggest you read the full rule book and the FAQ if you think you've got a new idea.  \n\n\n* **Rule Book**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index)\n* **FAQ:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)",

Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak](https://imgur.com/H4b2Cak)\n\n[https://imgur.com/QySEGOS](https://imgur.com/QySEGOS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/w074cpg](https://imgur.com/w074cpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.\n\nSince my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).\n\nInspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!\n\nThank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Holiday's y'all.",

        "text": "I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're \"crunchy parents\" to a 8 month old.\n\nBasically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea.\n\nOn Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing. \n\nWhen I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and \"threw out anything I don't need\". This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us.\n\nI was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items.\n\nMy brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",

        "text": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n\nAt first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n\nThe problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. \n\nThere are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. \n\nShe called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. \n\nI don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nfirst I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much. \n\nI talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because \"she is family\". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit. \n\nAt no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it. \n\nAnd for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me. \n\nAnd for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that. \n\nIf anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home.\n\n\nSo he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him.\n\n\nHe's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did.\n\n\n[Edit] few things to mention:\n\n(1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help.\n\n(2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's.\n\n(3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",

I'm looking forward to going over to everyone's houses for dinner and I'll be sure to bring all the things you said you liked :-) many flower lovers out there! I'm now also apparently the DIL to a lot of hopeful parents that replied as well so I hope I can deliver on expectations!\n\n\\---\n\nAfter my last update I told my bf I was sick and tired of him dancing around the issue with his parents and I was going to go over to their house whether he liked it or not. At this point I think he realized that whatever he was doing had backfired so he sat down all angry and told me he'd explain. I sat and he told me that he'd done something very spur of the moment and that he'd texted me from his dad's phone then blocked the number but begged me to listen. That he just needed to get his parents off me for a while and to not leave.\n\nApparently his parents had started hinting at him about marriage since my bf and I talked a lot about it. I fully expected to marry him as I said in another comment, and was honestly expecting a proposal in late spring since that's when we met. Four years dating didn't bother me but I was getting excited to settle down. However, my bf apparently realized that he absolutely didn't want to commit to anything and wanted to experiment and have fun since I \"wasn't being fun anymore\". Honestly that just made me cry since we were each other's firsts for everything and usually very good at communicating our needs.\n\nHis grand plan was to get him mad at me so I would beg for forgiveness and then he'd only accept an open relationship as an answer. Absolutely brilliant plan I know. He'd made up his parents getting mad but didn't expect me to blow off dinner completely and it's like \"hitting a jackpot\", his words not mine. He went over for dinner, hid the flowers and said we'd gotten into a huge fight but he was \"going to fix it\" but I needed space. After he confessed all this he said he was very sorry but really didn't want to miss out on new experiences when he was still young and would I consider an open relationship but pretend ours was strained with his parents so they wouldn't get suspicious?\n\nAnd.....I laughed. I laughed his ass right out the door and told him absolutely not and to leave me alone while I packed because I wanted to have some new experiences too!!! He never stopped begging me to stay but I left to sleep at a friend's. After calming down for a few days I cemented the breakup and finally, actually went over to his parent's. My ex-bf's dad never even noticed the phone missing but still apologized and his mom was a mess. I did and still love them and will eat dinner there without *him* as often as I can. I won't lie that I'm sad about four years down the drain, but that's life. And if that was my ex's best possible plan then I dodged the bullet by a mile.",

Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.\n\nThen the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.\n\nWe put our foot down and said:\n\n>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   \n>  \n>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  \n>  \n>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.\n\nThis has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. \n\nWe are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want. \n\nAITA?

He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.\n\n\nI visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might \"produce\" defective babies due to age.\n\n\nI told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his \"honest opinion\" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: \"trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!\". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.\n\nI think AITA but I'm not sure.",

Yesterday since it had already been days of us not talking. I listened to ur comments and decided to ask how would she feel if I told her only one of her parents could go cause *my* moms are uncomfortable around heterosexual couples. \n\nShe basically laughed and said it\u2019s not the same thing because that\u2019s a \u201cnormal couple\u201d. That kinda got me and I asked what\u2019s not normal about my moms. Think that\u2019s when she saw she fucked up with what she said. She said she didn\u2019t mean it like that and just knows it would be awkward and weird because her parents don\u2019t like that.\n\nThen I asked her if *she* would feel like that too. And she didn\u2019t say anything. We talked for a while and she still wasn\u2019t getting how this would hurt my moms asking them to hide who they are. Then it got to where she admitted it would also be embarrassing for her parents would know I have two moms.\n\nAnd yeah I wasn\u2019t gonna take that and told her we\u2019re done. Not gonna be w someone who\u2019s embarrassed about my moms or doesn\u2019t want others to know. That was it. \n\nMy friends haven\u2019t said anything to me yet but think I\u2019m just gonna block them out cause I don\u2019t wanna deal with their shit rn.\n\n\nI know I said in my comments I was thinking abut  asking my moms for advice but since we\u2019re broke up I\u2019m not gonna tell them why. I only told my moms it wasn\u2019t working out with her so we\u2019re done. \n\nThey dont need to why cause I don\u2019t want them to feel is their fault and they really liked my girlfriend. This would hurt their feelings knowing she was feeling that way. \n\nIts not my first break up but it still really sucks and I\u2019m feeling sad. It is what it is though. Thanks for everyone\u2019s help and for telling me ur own experiences.",

So many people wanted me to update on my previous post and wanted me to seek professional advice first before I take matters into my own hands. Apologies if it is long. I'll try to make it as detailed as possible while making this short.\n\nI went to my local therapist and told him about my situation and asked what to do. To keep it short, he said he's heard similar recounts from before and said it is best if I tell him as soon as possible for multiple reasons and to **make sure that my bio-children are present** (multiple reasons). I asked a few of my closest friends and the majority said more or less the same thing.\n\nMy wife and I decided to sit the kids down and burst the big bubble. I asked my brother Josh to come closer and I made sure I held him close and make him feel comfortable. He asked \"What's going on?\" but I started by telling us how much we cared and loved for him, then told him everything about my parents (I put them in a bright light in hopes of a reunion) and who I am to him, then quickly hugged him and my other two kids together and told him that I love all my children the same and NOTHING is going to change my love for him. He was shocked and asked if I was joking, but I was starting to cry a little at this point, so he knew I was serious. My bio-children were very surprised too. He was in tears and asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. I didn't know what to say and said \"I was just trying to protect you, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me\", but unfortunately and understandably, he left.\n\nHe didn't talk to me as much, again, understandably so. I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said \"I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before.\" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up. There's no longer anything to hide anymore and it feels like we are born again.\n\nJosh is a tough kid, and he handled this far better than I believed he would. I'll be looking into therapy for him to help him recover just incase it doesn't go well in the long run. I'll strive and continue to be a great dad to my kids, and a great dad to my brother/son. Thank you Reddit for pushing me towards this happy ending. Thank you for all the advice and judgements I got (excluding the rude ones about my uncles and aunts -- eeek!) I love you all. Good night.",

I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she\u2019s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn\u2019t understand stuff. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to put it. She\u2019s just a human body with nothing inside. \n\nShe\u2019s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don\u2019t know my stepmom very well and I don\u2019t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I\u2019m basically living with strangers because she\u2019s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I\u2019m used to it now.\n\nEver since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That\u2019s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don\u2019t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they\u2019re disappointed that I don\u2019t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. \n\nMy own mom passed away when I was small so I can\u2019t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I\u2019m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don\u2019t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don\u2019t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn\u2019t ask for this. \n\nAnyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don\u2019t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don\u2019t want to go and visit someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m there. \n\nMy stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven\u2019t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don\u2019t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don\u2019t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I\u2019m assuming my dad has told her I\u2019m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I\u2019m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. \n\nI just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I\u2019m justified in saying no.",

He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. \n\nHe gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.\n\nLeaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. \n\nI go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. \n\nAt 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. \n\nIt's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. \n\nAs far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). \n\nHe is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. \n\nAITA\n\nAdding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. \n\nAlso the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. \n\nAlso thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",

        "text": "My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning. \n\nI usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. \n\nShe has joked that I\u2019m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it\u2019s ok so I didn\u2019t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. \n\nHowever last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn\u2019t hear. She was bragging that I\u2019m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like \u2018good, put him in his place\u2019 and she was agreeing. \n\nShe specifically said \u2018yeah I\u2019m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I\u2019m up and he\u2019ll probably have breakfast ready for me too\u2019 \n\nI went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn\u2019t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. \n\nWhen she woke up she was yelling at me saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019ve cost her her exam and I\u2019m a piece of shit for what I did.\n\nEDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can\u2019t have my phone, work with food) I wasn\u2019t expecting this many replies so fast. \n\nI think we\u2019re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a \u2018bitch\u2019 for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she\u2019s not done with me. \n\nI\u2019m just trying to get through today\u2019s shift and then deal with stuff later. I\u2019ll try and get back as I can. We\u2019ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I\u2019m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small.",
