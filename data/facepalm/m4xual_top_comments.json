The most paranoid person I met was also always out to get people. He made a great salary but enjoyed small-scale theft, like he took pride in it. He proudly showed me how he'd bootlegged some software to use for work, that our workplace had purchased for me to be able to do the same work (and that I'd offered to do that work for him or let him have time on my computer). The building next to ours was under construction, and he kept asking about how likely he'd be to get caught if he took a bunch of bricks from that site to use for somethign at his apartment. We were all like....bricks are cheap, just go buy some bricks. I still wonder if he ever stole them. He was constantly looking to take advantage of people, and also constantly suspicious that everyone was trying to take advantage of him. What a sad way to live. He got fired for that behavior and the rest of us were relieved",
