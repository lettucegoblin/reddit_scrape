        "body": "Oh it's so much worse than that!\n\nSee, you know that massive deductible that you can barely afford? **Your employer (assuming you have insurance through your job, we can deal with individual policies separately) CHOSE that amount**. That's right: some executive in your company saw $1000 or even $0 deductibles and was like \"...nah.\"\n\nOh, and you know how your insurance barely sends flowers if you're pregnant and get some complications? **Your employer CHOSE that too!** There's  a bare minimum set of programs/benefits that insurance has to cover (serious: thanks ACA, before 2014 there was almost NOTHING that insurance policies HAD to cover...), but beyond those absolute basics...it's all a choice. **Some executive in your company thought long and hard about what kind of benefits they want to provide and were like \"...nah.\"**\n\nOoh! Don't forget those massive invoices that doctors send, which eventually go down to a few thousand dollars. Do you know WHY those amounts are so high? **It's because your doctor sees dollar signs when they know you're covered by employer based insurance!** Employer insurance generally reimburses doctors at far greater levels than Medicare and Medicaid, so the doctor is making his money off of you. That's right: the PRICE of your procedure differs based on what insurance you have.\n\n**[Side note: this is why, when you ask the doctor's office how much a procedure is going to cost, they stare at you blankly for a second and then start asking about your insurance coverage.]**\n\nAnd hey, about those massive invoices from the doctor's office: in a lot of cases, those are kinda illegal. **They're hoping you pay without asking questions,** not figuring out that a $100,000 surgery will eventually be reduced to, at most, your insurance coverage's Maximum Out of Pocket amount. **Is the MOOP too expensive as well? Well, guess what! Your employer CHOSE that amount too!**\n\n\"But why on earth does a tiny procedure run $100k?\", you ask. Remember how we talked about doctors setting prices based on your insurance? Well, **insurance companies are trying like hell to get doctors to LOWER their prices.** That's why, when a doctor joins an insurance network, they agree to reduce their billed claims by a certain percentage. But how does that work in practice?\n\n**Let's say a doctor WANTS to make $100k on your procedure.** The insurance company comes back to him and says, \"uh, no dude, you agreed to a network discount of 25%.\" And then the doctor goes, \"oh yeah...well in that case, I'm going to bill $133,333.\" And the insurance company goes \"sigh...I guess I can't stop you, but this isn't cool.\" And the doctor goes, \"you need me for network adequacy purposes, sorry not sorry.\"\n\n[Side note: **insurance companies make the most money when you're as healthy as can possibly be, and prescriptions and procedures are as affordable as they can possibly be.**]\n\nBut! Quick history lesson on why insurance companies started denying claims in the first place, because they didn't used to: **at some point, doctors began abusing the system.** Way back in the day, if you went to a doctor, they'd do what they thought was necessary to get you healthy, and they were reimbursed by insurance, and you paid your bill, and everyone operated in good faith. But somewhere along the line, **health care providers figured out that if they just tacked an MRI or a behavioral exam or an opioid prescription onto every case, they could make bank. So they did.** So insurance companies had to start making judgement calls, like \"hey, there's a whole bunch of options which might solve this issue before you go nuclear.\" **It wasn't too long ago that doctors were EXCORIATING insurance companies...because insurance companies were dissuading doctors from prescribing opioids in massive quantities.**\n\nThis history of abuse does two things. First, it absolutely FUCKS with a well-meaning doctor who is just trying to get you healthy by prescribing a procedure which he thinks has the best chance of getting you healthy. Second, it underscores the philosophical problem we have in this country: **sick people should not be a fucking profit center.**\n\nLast bit: you know how your medical insurance is separate from dental insurance and vision insurance? Well, **insurance companies have been trying for DECADES to get them integrated.** Guess who has moved heaven and earth to keep that from happening? Employers (actually, advocacy groups on behalf of employers, but still...). Why? **Because they're still not so sure about providing those benefits in the first place, and want the option to carve them out.** Same with prescription drug insurance (the Rx world is its own special nightmare which is even more complicated than medical insurance). Employers want, and fight for, the ability to carve prescription drugs out of their insurance offerings to some extent or another. **An integrated medical/dental/vision/pharmacy plan would be the most efficient and affordable insurance policy ever...and has almost 0% chance of happening at a large scale.**\n\nInsurance is a fucking hassle to deal with at every step. But when you get word that the insurance company has denied a claim, there's a whole perverse system behind that denial.\n\n**We need healthcare reform in the worst fucking way.**",

That&#39;s right: some executive in your company saw $1000 or even $0 deductibles and was like &quot;...nah.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and you know how your insurance barely sends flowers if you&#39;re pregnant and get some complications? <strong>Your employer CHOSE that too!</strong> There&#39;s  a bare minimum set of programs/benefits that insurance has to cover (serious: thanks ACA, before 2014 there was almost NOTHING that insurance policies HAD to cover...), but beyond those absolute basics...it&#39;s all a choice. <strong>Some executive in your company thought long and hard about what kind of benefits they want to provide and were like &quot;...nah.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ooh! Don&#39;t forget those massive invoices that doctors send, which eventually go down to a few thousand dollars. Do you know WHY those amounts are so high? <strong>It&#39;s because your doctor sees dollar signs when they know you&#39;re covered by employer based insurance!</strong> Employer insurance generally reimburses doctors at far greater levels than Medicare and Medicaid, so the doctor is making his money off of you. That&#39;s right: the PRICE of your procedure differs based on what insurance you have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[Side note: this is why, when you ask the doctor&#39;s office how much a procedure is going to cost, they stare at you blankly for a second and then start asking about your insurance coverage.]</strong></p>\n\n<p>And hey, about those massive invoices from the doctor&#39;s office: in a lot of cases, those are kinda illegal. <strong>They&#39;re hoping you pay without asking questions,</strong> not figuring out that a $100,000 surgery will eventually be reduced to, at most, your insurance coverage&#39;s Maximum Out of Pocket amount. <strong>Is the MOOP too expensive as well? Well, guess what! Your employer CHOSE that amount too!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;But why on earth does a tiny procedure run $100k?&quot;, you ask. Remember how we talked about doctors setting prices based on your insurance? Well, <strong>insurance companies are trying like hell to get doctors to LOWER their prices.</strong> That&#39;s why, when a doctor joins an insurance network, they agree to reduce their billed claims by a certain percentage. But how does that work in practice?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s say a doctor WANTS to make $100k on your procedure.</strong> The insurance company comes back to him and says, &quot;uh, no dude, you agreed to a network discount of 25%.&quot; And then the doctor goes, &quot;oh yeah...well in that case, I&#39;m going to bill $133,333.&quot; And the insurance company goes &quot;sigh...I guess I can&#39;t stop you, but this isn&#39;t cool.&quot; And the doctor goes, &quot;you need me for network adequacy purposes, sorry not sorry.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>[Side note: <strong>insurance companies make the most money when you&#39;re as healthy as can possibly be, and prescriptions and procedures are as affordable as they can possibly be.</strong>]</p>\n\n<p>But! Quick history lesson on why insurance companies started denying claims in the first place, because they didn&#39;t used to: <strong>at some point, doctors began abusing the system.</strong> Way back in the day, if you went to a doctor, they&#39;d do what they thought was necessary to get you healthy, and they were reimbursed by insurance, and you paid your bill, and everyone operated in good faith. But somewhere along the line, <strong>health care providers figured out that if they just tacked an MRI or a behavioral exam or an opioid prescription onto every case, they could make bank. So they did.</strong> So insurance companies had to start making judgement calls, like &quot;hey, there&#39;s a whole bunch of options which might solve this issue before you go nuclear.&quot; <strong>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that doctors were EXCORIATING insurance companies...because insurance companies were dissuading doctors from prescribing opioids in massive quantities.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This history of abuse does two things. First, it absolutely FUCKS with a well-meaning doctor who is just trying to get you healthy by prescribing a procedure which he thinks has the best chance of getting you healthy. Second, it underscores the philosophical problem we have in this country: <strong>sick people should not be a fucking profit center.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last bit: you know how your medical insurance is separate from dental insurance and vision insurance? Well, <strong>insurance companies have been trying for DECADES to get them integrated.</strong> Guess who has moved heaven and earth to keep that from happening? Employers (actually, advocacy groups on behalf of employers, but still...). Why? <strong>Because they&#39;re still not so sure about providing those benefits in the first place, and want the option to carve them out.</strong> Same with prescription drug insurance (the Rx world is its own special nightmare which is even more complicated than medical insurance). Employers want, and fight for, the ability to carve prescription drugs out of their insurance offerings to some extent or another. <strong>An integrated medical/dental/vision/pharmacy plan would be the most efficient and affordable insurance policy ever...and has almost 0% chance of happening at a large scale.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Insurance is a fucking hassle to deal with at every step. But when you get word that the insurance company has denied a claim, there&#39;s a whole perverse system behind that denial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We need healthcare reform in the worst fucking way.</strong></p>\n</div>",

Pretty bad tibia and fibula are in 20 or so pieces my entire legs compressed into the knee causing fracturing on the lower patella. \n\nDue to the injury my leg is now a inch or so shorter than my other. I will require multiple surgeries, lots of PT and still no guarantee im ever going to be 100% again. \n\nFirst surgery yesterday was to straighten my leg and stretch it out to decompress the muscles and swelling in the knee, or i run risk of blood-flow being cut off to the leg and losing it completely. \n\nNext surgery will be to reconstruct the broken bones in the knee (approximately 3 hr surgery all goes well) if its found during surgery i need a cadaver or something there will be another surgery scheduled. \n\nOnly then will i begin my 6 months of full bed ridden non movement and slow recovery. Being a welding pipe inspector too, this is going to be detrimental to my career.\n\n\n*All of this with 0 insurance* , the entire system is going to literally fuck me so bad i will spiral deeper into my depression and my bipolar disorder will annihilate me. \n\nStay safe man and pay the extra even if it does seem like stupid shit we all just need to keep voting universal healthcare is a goddamn right and it will be put into law\n\n\nEdit: i also forgot to mention i was given two ambulance rides during this all. 1 was the intial 911, and the other was a transfer to the other hospital with an ortho surgeon",
