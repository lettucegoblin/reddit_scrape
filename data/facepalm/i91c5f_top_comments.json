        "body": "Apparently people don't understand how stamps work. \n\nI know this is gonna be downvoted like crazy but the United States Postal Service actually \"receives\u00a0NO tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.\"\n\nThis is partly why FedEx, UPS, and Amazon use the USPS to deliver local parcels, despite having the resources to deliver it themselves. \n\nThe USPS is dying. They are severely underfunded, understaffed, and receive no government assistance to continue operating. Sure they have an annual revenue of 70 billion dollars, but their annual expenses exceed their revenue by nearly 4 billion dollars annually. This is why you receive so many junk ads in your mailbox, is bc that postage keeps the mail carrier service barely treading water. People sending flat mail such as letters has dropped by 31% in the last decade, which is a massive revenue loss. And due to lack of funding they've even closed 4% (1,300+) post offices and have had to let go of 11% of their total workforce (~80,000 employees) while trying to expand more delivery points, which shot up by over 8 million locations.\n\nThe USPS had requested a relief bailout (like many other dying capitalistic businesses) and was frankly told \"No.\" They were told they \"could open a loan or have nothing at all\", and Trump said he would veto any relief effort to bailout the postal service.

They are severely underfunded, understaffed, and receive no government assistance to continue operating. Sure they have an annual revenue of 70 billion dollars, but their annual expenses exceed their revenue by nearly 4 billion dollars annually. This is why you receive so many junk ads in your mailbox, is bc that postage keeps the mail carrier service barely treading water.
