After WOTLK ended, Blizzard got absorbed by cancer Call of Duty developers. \n\nWorld of Warcraft today is a rotting corpse propped up with RNG, micro-transactions and timegating mechanics. Ever seen how they behaved when players protested? \n\nBack in Warlords of Draenor, 5.5 million players unsubbed to protest their \"no flying\" expansion. They reluctantly added it back in but not without punishing the players out of spite first. They made it a 5 month long grind just to be able to fly.\n\nThey've ignored feedback, boldly and outright made fun of players in their livestreams and forced their own vision of the game onto players. They told us how they want us to play. How they want us to think. You see, we think we wanted Vanilla but we really didn't. What we wanted was their steaming pile of RNG coinslot shit. \n\nThey wanted to release a MMO on a fucking phone and when players didn't like that, did you see the amount of surprise and resentment the developers had? I bet that was the last time they ever allowed people to show them up again. I think you could pinpoint the moment where their egos shattered in the video. You see, they'd been so used to being able to ignore any feedback that this was literally the first time they'd ever seen feedback before.\n\nI'm not surprised about this and neither should anyone else. This is nothing but classic Blizzard. The only reason they released Classic WoW is because their sub count for retail is under 1.5 million worldwide and dropping. I definitely felt satisfaction when they made the guy who said it, announce the release. Goddamn, play that at my funeral.\n\nThis attempt to get China to like them may actually be their final gasps for air as they slowly die. I know I'll be there when they do and I'll celebrate the end of a repulsive company that ruined World of Warcraft.\n\nWhat I am surprised about is how they're charging right at death itself. Do they think China will protect them after they've made it clear that they're willing to fuck us over? And I mean really clear, to the point where even your typical casual who will suck Blizzard's cock will notice that they're willing to fuck him over as well.\n\nLol, never put it past Blizzard to do anything assholish. It's corporate pride. I quit WoW a year ago, never looked back.",

        "body": "Under new EU laws you can also demand they send you the data they have on you, and if they fail to respond in (i believe 30?) days, they're subject to massive fines. \n\nThis is a much better strategy than people in the EU deleting their accounts.  If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines.  And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you.\n\n[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee) has some info about the regulation. \n\n**EDIT:**  [A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35dslz/) people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.  \n\n**EDIT**:  [Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow \"get it taken away](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35o74c/)\n\nA lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.\n\n**EDIT:**  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I've heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that's fine.  They can't just *not* fulfill the request.  \n\nKeep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.\n\n**EDIT**:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately \"malicious\".  For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's \"hard\" for companies to comply.\n\n**EDIT**:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is \"abusing\" it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime. \n\nThat's why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will \"take it away\" *if you use it* is absurd.  \n\nAnd if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data. \n\nThat's a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It's your data, not their property.  \n\n**We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are \"hard\", then we know the laws need to be strengthened.**\n\n**EDIT:**  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected. \n\nIt's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data. \n\nThere is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: *stop compiling and reselling user data*. \n\nBlizzard doesn't *have* to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nThey could just, I dunno, make good games?",

And you&#39;ll get your data, which is great, because if they&#39;re owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they&#39;ve accumulated on you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee\">This article</a> has some info about the regulation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35dslz/\">A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter</a> people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35o74c/\">Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow &quot;get it taken away</a></p>\n\n<p>A lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I&#39;ve heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that&#39;s fine.  They can&#39;t just <em>not</em> fulfill the request.  </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard&#39;s stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately &quot;malicious&quot;.  For two, laws aren&#39;t usually chucked out the window because it&#39;s &quot;hard&quot; for companies to comply.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is &quot;abusing&quot; it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will &quot;take it away&quot; <em>if you use it</em> is absurd.  </p>\n\n<p>And if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It&#39;s your data, not their property.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are &quot;hard&quot;, then we know the laws need to be strengthened.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They&#39;re very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data. </p>\n\n<p>There is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: <em>stop compiling and reselling user data</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Blizzard doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn&#39;t need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.</p>\n\n<p>They could just, I dunno, make good games?</p>\n</div>",

The entire EU's strategy is to set itself up as the guardian of your digital rights, and export this regulation. This is not only done for scoring domestic points, it exemplifies our best means to assert control over non-domestic industry. This is [a geopolitical strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect), not some random law.\n\n3. The new Commission for the next five years is being put through parliamentary inquiries right now. Vestager, the same woman who took on the digital giants as competition commissioner, will be the minister equivalent (= here, vice president) for the digital single market & competition. As stated earlier, GDPR is not only one of her main weapons but a weapon she helped craft. A high-profile case such as HK is a godsend for the EU, which generally has a hard time doing PR.\n\nIn conclusion: if Europeans decide to use GDPR - which we should! - then the EU Commission will unequivocally stand behind a law it itself wants and needs.
