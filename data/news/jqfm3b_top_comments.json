We read a [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/alex-trebek-stylist-phil-wayne) on it and apparently he wanted to work it into the show. We weren't expecting him to wear it on the show, we just wanted to share how much joy it gave my mom and I each night.\n\nI'm really saddened by his passing. I applaud him for continuing the show even when he wasn't in good health. He was a really good man, made a ton of people so happy and did a lot for the trivia community. RIP Alex <3\n\nEdit: For anyone curious, [here's him in the tie](https://imgur.com/a/LELie9F). This was January 2016.  \nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold! I'm glad the story is enjoyed!",

But I know Dad was there at the pearly gates with an extra guitar in hand to welcome EVH.</p>\n\n<p>Hugs to you. Losing a loved one is awful. Alex Trebek was a staple in my home growing up, Dad and I watched every night together. I\u2019m sure he was there to greet Alex as well as many other fans like your grandma.</p>\n\n<p>ETA: thank you so much for the wholesome award <a href=\"/u/unlikely--hero\">u/unlikely--hero</a>. Hugs to you!</p>\n\n<p>ETA 2: An anonymous friendo gifted me a hug award. So kind! I expected wholesomeness on this thread since Alex\nTrebek was an incredible person who touched the lives of many. What I never expected was to receive awards for sharing some of my story with you all. Hugs for everyone!!!</p>\n</div>",

You\u2019re right that celebrities can become like extended family members to us.\n\nWhen Eddie died an ex of mine from 15 years ago texted me out of the blue (it was a cordial breakup but we haven\u2019t spoken in years) sending condolences to my dad. I explained that he had passed away which made my ex even sadder... until I said that my family was actually *overjoyed* for my Dad.\n\nHis entire life Dad wanted to meet Eddie and tell him how much he meant to him. How his dream was to jam together and make their guitars sing. My family voted to forego Christmas and birthday presents several years in a row to afford front row seats to Van Halen concerts when they toured around 10-15 years ago with Sammy Hagar. That was the closest we came and as luck would have it our seats were directly in front of Eddie. I\u2019ve never seen my Dad so happy and now I\u2019m crying remembering that concert and looking at his expression of pure amazement. \n\nI never in my wildest dreams imagined that they would actually get to meet, and fairly soon, much less on the other side. When I hear rumbles in the sky for no reason I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s them playing together. Makes me so happy, just the way imagining Alex Trebek was greeted by an endless walkway of fans clapping and cheering for him on makes me smile. \n\nMy heart is heavy for our losses but I\u2019m genuinely happy for our loved ones. Who doesn\u2019t want to shake the hand of someone who meant so much to them? They\u2019re the lucky ones! Thank you for sharing your story and for reading mine.
