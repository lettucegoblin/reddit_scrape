Some critics have argued that legalization would lead to an increase in crime, while others have suggested that it could actually make police more effective at fighting crime.\nNew data suggests that the latter may be true. According to recent FBI statistics, crime clearance rates - the percentage of reported crimes that are solved by police - have increased significantly faster in Washington and Colorado than the rest of the country since legalization.\nIn 2018, Washington's crime clearance rate was 53%, up from 46% in 2012. Meanwhile, Colorado's clearance rate rose from 50% to 59%. By comparison, the national clearance rate only increased from 47% to 48%.\nThis suggests that legalization may be freeing up police",

        "text": "Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  \n\n\nStart-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.\n\n\nThis is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. \n\n\nThis is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).\n\nIn comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).\n\n\nWhat can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.\n\nEdit: There is an official White House petition you can sign to express your opposition: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/opposition-taxation-graduate-student-tuition-waivers-and-remissions\n\nAslo: https://medium.com/@avandervort/an-open-letter-to-the-senate-concerning-h-r-1-and-the-graduate-student-tax-provision-5ff7ace9262d\n\n ",

However, when classes were held online during the pandemic, this gender gap completely disappeared.\nThe researchers believe that this could be due to several factors, including changes in teaching methods, increased accessibility for students with children or other responsibilities, and reduced distractions in virtual environments.\n\"We suspect that the gender gap in education is partially driven",

The researchers analyzed data from the General Social Survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, which included responses from more than 26,000 people aged 18 to 34. They found that the percentage of young adults who had casual sex in the previous year decreased from 51% in 2008 to 35% in 2018.\nOne potential explanation for this decline is a decrease in drinking among young adults. The researchers found that those who reported drinking alcohol before sex were less likely to engage in casual sex.
