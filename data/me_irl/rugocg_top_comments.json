The really scary thing that I\u2019m seeing in the real estate market right now is that foreign investors and foreign countries themselves are coming to the USA and buying up whole large swaths of land and homes, not flipping them, just jacking up the prices and renting them. With no real management company the renters can\u2019t get things fixed and there really isn\u2019t much of a legal recourse bc it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. People are paying in rent 2-4 times what they would in a mortgage but are forced to rent bc either rentals are all there that\u2019s out there or bc they can\u2019t buy a house since they constantly get out bid by cash buying investment corps/governments. This is also helping to up home prices. Now if that\u2019s not scary enough for you, about man I wanna say it was 5 years ago now, China said they didn\u2019t plan to start wars anymore to take over they would just buy up land and property to fuel money pots until they get it all. Once they own all the land and property it doesn\u2019t really matter what the country calls itself, it\u2019s economically theirs now and they can control the country without actually calling it their territory. Now they have been doing this for a long time, longer than 5 years when they actually came out and said they were, but now it is easier than ever and they are doing it on a massive scale now. The US gov isnt trying to do anything about it either. If they don\u2019t pass laws soon and enforce them, it will be too late soon. \n\nThis same thing has already happened in Canada. Anyone in real estate from there can tell you about the house prices and players there. Also you aren\u2019t in the clear even if you already own a house AND don\u2019t have a mortgage bc once they own everything around you they will be able to force you out and take your house for cheap by buying your mortgage and then calling it in.

That is a worst case apocalyptic scenario. \n\nAnd before any collapse happens, you invest a good chunk of that $100k in the S&P 500 and take home a nice and safe 8%-9% yearly return and let it compound. \n\n------------\n\nLets work out the math on this.\n\nLets assume a collapse happens in 5 years and you buy a $750k home.\n\n Keep $25k as an emergency fund, and rest the remaining $75k.

As a result, the share of smaller homes (again under 1,800 square feet) built each year fell from 50 percent in 1988 to 36 percent in\n2000 to 22 percent in 2017.\n * In 2015, there were 81.5 million singe family homes and 37.3 million were under 1,800 square feet. 65 percent of those under 1,800 sq ft were built before 1980\n\n\nThere were 112,000 new homes sold in 2017 over $500,000 representing 18% of all homes sold.  30% of New Homes in 2017 had 3,000 or more Sq Ft.\n\n\n* In the NE there 18,000 homes over $500,000 sold or 47% of all homes sold in the region \n * 35% of New Homes in 2017 had 3,000 or more Sq Ft.\n* In the South there 43,000 homes over $500,000 sold or 13% of all homes sold in the region\n * 32% of New Homes in 2017 had 3,000 or more Sq Ft.\n* In the Midwest there 7,000 homes over $500,000 sold or 11% of all homes sold in the region\n * 27% of New Homes in 2017 had 3,000 or more Sq Ft.\n* In the West there 42,000 homes over $500,000 sold or 26% of all homes sold in the region\n * 23% of New Homes in 2017 had 3,000 or more Sq Ft.\n\n_______\n\nbut also consider High demand due to population growth and limited new supplies.

But this time around, according to local city councillor Gord Perks, those behind the project are already planning to go to the province to seek approval.\n\n**Aubrey Friesner has lived in the neighborhood for 15-years and was a vocal opponent of the first proposal.**\n\n> His biggest concern is increased traffic in the area since the proposed development will have 100 parking spaces \u2014 80 residential spots for 327 residential units and 20 for commercial tenants and visitors.\n\n> * \"You can't turn left on Bloor, so cars will have to drive up and circle through the adjacent neighbourhoods,\" said Friesner, who lives in a house on a nearby street.\n\n-----\nAt the corner of 16th and S streets NW in Dupont Circle in Washington DC is the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry Temple. The Masons want to redevelop the patch of grass and parking lot behind the building, and turn into revenue generating apartments for the Freemasons future renovation of their temple.\n\nThe masons hired an architect who designed a 150 unit Apartment Building with parking\n\n * Four stories high above ground, plus two stories of apartments below ground atop 109 below-grade parking spaces. That\u2019s less dense than most of the new buildings in Duponte Circle..\n\nAffordable Apartments in DC\n\n* With a rooftop pool and sumptuous garden, the apartments would consist mainly of market-rate rentals. As required by the District for new construction, there would also be about a dozen \u201caffordable\u201d units, evenly distributed throughout the complex.\n* About 20 of the units would be atleast partially underground.  All rents have not been set for the building, but underground units would priced at 20 percent below market rates\n * Thats 35 - 40 affordable units\n\nStyle\n\n * The crux of residents\u2019 objections is that the building\u2019s modern brick-and-glass design clashes with the neighborhood\u2019s historic aesthetic.\n * Penthouse residential units will have terraces, while a penthouse clubroom will open out to an outdoor pool deck.\n\n**Neighbors Reactionary comments (NIMBY)\u2014the project is too big, the parcel is too historic, the views are too incredible, and the green space is too precious to possibly accommodate the construction of apartments in which people will live**\n\n * redevelop a patch of grass and parking lot behind the building\n\n-----\nIn 2013 a developer proposed 75-unit housing project that was on the site of a \u201chistoric\u201d laundromat at 2918 Mission St. in San Francisco \n\n>The project site consists of three lots on the west side of Mission Street between 25~ Street and 26th Street;\nthe southernmost lot extends from Mission Street to Osage Alley.

Two retail spaces, totaling about 6,700 sf, would front Mission Street on either side of the\nbuilding lobby. A 44-foot-long white loading zone would be provided in front of the lobby and the\nexisting parking lot curb cut would be replaced with sidewalk. A bicycle storage room with 76 class 1\nbicycle spaces would be accessed through the lobby area \n\nIt was approved  in October 2018 \u2014 without appeals from its fierce opposition after 5 years of delays.\n\nThe project, which had been juggled between \n\n * the Planning Commission and \n* A major issue of discussion in the Eastern Neighborhoods rezoning process was the degree to which\nexisting industrially-zoned land would be rezoned to primarily residential and mixed-use districts, thus\nreducing the availability of land traditionally used for PDR employment and businesses.\n * the Board of Supervisors \n * the historical studies,\n * the shadow studies,\n * lawsuit filed by Project Owner to force the completion of the new housing",

As required by the District for new construction, there would also be about a dozen \u201caffordable\u201d units, evenly distributed throughout the complex.</li>\n<li>About 20 of the units would be atleast partially underground.  All rents have not been set for the building, but underground units would priced at 20 percent below market rates\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thats 35 - 40 affordable units</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Style</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The crux of residents\u2019 objections is that the building\u2019s modern brick-and-glass design clashes with the neighborhood\u2019s historic aesthetic.</li>\n<li>Penthouse residential units will have terraces, while a penthouse clubroom will open out to an outdoor pool deck.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Neighbors Reactionary comments (NIMBY)\u2014the project is too big, the parcel is too historic, the views are too incredible, and the green space is too precious to possibly accommodate the construction of apartments in which people will live</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>redevelop a patch of grass and parking lot behind the building</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>In 2013 a developer proposed 75-unit housing project that was on the site of a \u201chistoric\u201d laundromat at 2918 Mission St. in San Francisco </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project site consists of three lots on the west side of Mission Street between 25~ Street and 26th Street;\nthe southernmost lot extends from Mission Street to Osage Alley.

It starts with the foundations and the ground. Seen numerous times where the foundation wasn't done right, so either the house settles really quick and cracks start, nail pops, floor buckles or the foundation isn't waterproof right and then you get water knocking out the ground and moving the foundation. Once the foundation is fucked, they build the house, again this is the best part. The walls are usually built offsite in a condition area, brought out on a flat bed truck and sat up, why it seems homes go up so fast. But again these walls where built true and square offsite and placed on a foundation that isn't squared and level, which the cracks and squeaks come from. \n\nThen the trades come in, plumbers that don't know hot is on the left and cold is on the right, yes serious this is a big warranty item. HVAC guys that do these homes are hacks, they still put in high static duct work systems nicknamed \"spider systems\". This design destroys HVAC equipment with the quickness. Then the electricians come in, these guys can't wire a 3 way switch. I can go on and on and on about these 3 trades and the horrible shit they do. Will save that for another time\n\nSo after all this you got sheetrock and paint. Then trim and cabinets. Then the trades come back to do the final, find the sheet rock guys cut up their shit, or covered up something. Then they find that the customer had all these extras that didn't get installed in the rough in, so out comes the hammers and Sawzalls to fix it quickly. Then the floor guys come in they clean everything and you move in.\n\nThese homes are built way too fast and way too cheap that the only labor they can afford is very inexperienced. The guys the builder hires to oversee these homes being built are also young guys who might know what they are doing but they too are held to these ridiculous time lines. Everything in the house is moving real fast that a lot of stuff gets looked over. For one thing is, they will start a home while the customer and builder are still in talks, so the guys don't even get the list of extras till after paint is done. And they don't have time to fix it right, they just fix it. Think about how they fix shit with little to no time or money left.\n\nWith so many homes being built inspectors can't look at everything and they get paid peanuts that no one wants to be an inspector. It's a perfect storm and no one is trying to fix it. I feel very bad for people buying these homes, they have no idea how bad they are being screwed.\n\nDamn I typed all this.... sorry",
