If game sells well, company can make hundreds of millions of profits just by selling the game. GTA V, Witcher 3, Most Wanted, etc. are many examples. Microtransactions was always part of EA games as they make billions from them. However, there's a business strategy here. If the customer complaints are not enough and company still makes millions of dollars of profit, they will continue doing this, and later, exploit the customers even further.

In SSBM, Mewtwo required 20 hours of matches or 700 matches, whichever you hit first.  G&W required you to beat multiple modes and the target tests with all of the other characters in the game OR 1000 matches.  This sort of thing is fine if you enjoy playing the game.

Big thing is gone is the performance tuning options, for what credits you earn, you're better off spending on your current ride to keep getting faster then bring better cars.
