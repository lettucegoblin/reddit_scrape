We gradually got free maps and modes and even a brand new Titan. I was happy buying scotch prime because it didn't feel like something that was stripped from the game and I didn't feel pressured into buying it. I feel like I got more than my money's worth out of that game and I didn't feel cheated or used when I bought prime scorch. It didn't affect gameplay and I knew what I would be getting when I bought it. I think dlc in that case is okay, but the moment I get a bare husk of a game with an extra $50 season pass (like battlefront or destiny) or a scummy loot crate system (like gears of war 4) is the moment I stop buying games from that franchise or developer.",

        "body": "EA has a strategy here, and it isn't to \"trick\" people into buying the game so that they can reactivate transactions later in a Palpatine-esque \"gotcha\" moment. Understanding their reasoning is the key to achieving any real change in the system.\n\nWhat they *are* doing is scoping out the reaction. Right now, they don't know whether or not this backlash actually represents a major loss in sales. That's what they are trying to determine. Three things could happen for EA:\n\n1. The game still sells extremely well showing that the backlash wasn't something most consumers cared about. EA makes a lot of money and only adds very minor changes to the progression system, knowing that most of the players don't mind it in its current state. This is obviously the best case for EA.\n\n2. The game sells well, but another backlash occurs when they reintroduce lootcrates with only minor changes. In this case, they might roll with the punches and accept a less-than-stellar sales rate on the game and its lootboxes, or they'll introduce slightly more radical (but disappointing and insufficient) changes to progression while keeping the same basic system. For example, they might make pay-to-win crates cheaper while adding optional cosmetic crates to make up for the losses. In my opinion, everybody loses if this happens - EA won't get the sales they wanted, Battlefront 2 won't be the long-term cash cow they were expecting, a huge proportion of consumers will be unhappy, and the game's playerbase will fizzle away quickly.\n\n3. The game significantly underperforms compared to their projections. This means that the progression system will undergo serious changes since it will be clear that most consumers hate the current scheme. This could mean EA will change lootcrates to have nothing to do with progression, and replace star card drops with cosmetics. Now, this would be the best case scenario for us, and a pretty good scenario for EA (barring the 1st case) simply because overhauling the progression system is the key to keeping the game alive for a long time. EA is well aware of the value of a long lifespan. After all, that's why they aren't selling maps. A unified playerbase not split by map DLC means that players will find it easier to keep coming back, meaning more people will buy crates crates over a long period of time. Pay-to-win crates simply don't have the same staying power as cosmetic crates, and EA will realize this if they are forced to change the system.\n\nDisabling crystal purchases won't be long term change, probably a week or two at most while they determine how strongly they have to respond to criticisms of the progression system. This means the next few days are crucial for getting rid of pay-to-win crates. IMO, there's not much any individual can do other than avoid buying the game until they give a concrete answer. You won't have to wait long, because as soon as EA sees the launch sale numbers, they'll reveal what the \"changes\" will be. For now, we just have to hope the backlash hurt the game's image enough to dissuade a big enough proportion of potential consumers from buying the game at launch.",

Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\"\n\n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online?\n\n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\"\n\n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\"\n\n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the box, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"GoG?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet. The long list of third party services had come with service charges that ballooned his rate to twice what he expected to pay. \"My last service provider didn't charge me extra to use Netflix or Spotify or Steam. This seems like a racket!\"\n\n\n\"Well, sir, you're welcome to use a competitor, then. LARGENET services the other side of town.

This isn't unusual as it's also what 13 other cities within Orange County do instead of starting their own police department's. As part of this contract, Orange County operates their substations like it does anywhere else. there are administrative personnel, traffic cars, bike patrol, traffic cars, detectives, etc. who all work on Reedy Creek and Disney properties. It's not unusual for a Sheriff's Office, or any large law enforcement agency, to have marksmen \"snipers\" on their emergency response teams, backup generators \"power grids\" for substations, animal control and/or contracted vets \"animal hospital\" for injured doggos. The so called \"tunnels\" that lead everywhere are more specific to Disney properties and their operations for staff movement which is out of public view; and to expand on this, there are some tunnels but mostly they are for connecting facilities and the walkways are otherwise open air. As far as Orange County Deputies, we're talking about a single hallway which connects a sallyport to a substation booking room at best.   \n  \nIn addition, after the Pulse incident, Disney allocated an additional $13.5 million annually to offer deputies off-duty contract hours specifically on Disney properties. While the Reedy Creek District does provide law enforcement with its contracted policing model arranged with Orange County (again, not uncommon in the United States), Disney simply wanted extra uniforms (with guns). As such, they went straight to the Orange County Sheriff for this service, built a nice on-property substation, and now Orange County deputies have a handful of shifts they can sign up to work specifically at Disney on their days off. This also isn't uncommon. Let's say you host a wedding at /u/GarciaJones 's house and you want guests to feel safe while keeping wedding crashers out. Just contact your local law enforcement agency, draw up a contract and they'll bill you probably $50-$75 per hour to have a cop and squad car dedicated to work your event. For you, when you call 911, they dispatch the contracted /u/GarciaJones cop instead of a beat car. This is a win-win-win situation for everyone involved. It keeps beat cars free for matters outside your event, makes your guests feel good, gives a public perception that more cops are working, saves public tax dollars, offers overtime to cops which aren't paid that well anyways for a career position, and is way better than hiring a security guard.  \n   \nAs a caveat...yes, Disney also has their own \"Public Safety Department\" which is staffed by civilian EMT's and Security Officers. It's plausible to get transferred to their dispatch, or the on-site Orange County substation in the event a kid wandered off or you lost a wallet.     \n   \nIt's probably this combination of seeing Disney Security working hand in hand with contracted deputies, along with Orange County deputies who work out of Reedy Creek / Disney substations, which give off the public and employee perception that Reedy Creek has their own police department. But they don't. It's Orange County Sheriff's Office.",
