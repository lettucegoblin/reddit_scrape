That's over twice the amount of working a full time, 40 hour-a-week job for a year, and very few people will play even a quarter of that. What are your plans to retain a playerbase with such a slow progression system?\n\nEdit: I think we may have crashed the site for the second article, [here's](https://gamerant.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-hours-cost-unlock-all-content/) another\n\nEdit 2: Since we crashed the original time estimate article, I wanted to point out something the replacement article does not cover (credit to /u/Iambecomelumens):\n>This estimate ignores the time required to get all cards to level 3, the time required to unlock all heroes, and daily crates.\n\nEdit 3: It's been pointed out that the 4528 number may be speculation. If so, can we get some more concrete numbers? The math behind that estimate appears pretty sound, and even if it's off by a wide margin that's still an absurdly high timesink, especially for a game series that expects to see annual or bi-annual releases.\n\nEdit 3.5 (A Star Wars Story):\nWell guys, it's been well over 2 hours now and I've held my tongue for as long as possible. It seems DICE is not going to respond to the (currently) **top rated** question in this AMA. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt, but we've been doing that for much too long. At this point, I can only conclude one reason we haven't got a response. **They don't have an answer.** It seems it's as we knew all along, these choices were primarily made based on greed (whether that be on the behest of EA or DICE, we may never know). It also appears they cannot give a concrete number on how much time/money unlocks require, likely because they are too close to the aforementioned 4528 number than they care to admit. I imagine this AMA is wrapping up soon, but perhaps DICE would like to take one last chance to prove me wrong?\n\nEdit 4: It looks like this AMA is over. Of course DICE refused to answer this question, likely because EA's PR team couldn't come up with a good answer or wouldn't approve theirs. There were a few decent answers that made things clearer, but it was mostly stonewalling. It's a shame, because I genuinely enjoyed what I played during the beta, but I can't support these types of practices nor do I enjoy being walled off by microtransactions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember people, **vote with your wallets**. There's nothing wrong with waiting a few months to see the state of things, and you might get lucky and catch a sale!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(ninja word edits also thanks for the golds)",

        "body": "EA and DICE,\n\nFirst of all, we as a community would like to thank you for putting so much effort into Star Wars Battlefront II. We want you to know that we are so passionately critical of the game because we genuinely want it to be good, and are excited to play it. However, we don\u2019t want the gameplay to be ruined by a slow progression system that gives advantages to players who buy micro-transactions. While Battlefront II isn\u2019t technically pay-to-win, it IS pay-to-save-a-large-amount-of-time.\n\nWe don\u2019t want you to fall to the darkside.\n\nThese are our biggest requests:\n\n1. Lootboxes should be removed. These ruin the feeling of accomplishment, are a form of gambling, and are obviously an incentive for players to buy credits using micro-transactions. Currently, Battlefront feels like a free mobile game, not a $60-$80 AAA title. There should be absolutely no micro-transactions that affect progression. While we recognize that you need money to continue creating free DLC, it should not come at the expense of fair gameplay. A compromise can be limiting lootboxes to cosmetic items only, so you can still make money.\n\n2. Players should receive enough credits to purchase Star Cards after every hour of playtime. That\u2019s about  2-3 rounds of Galactic Assault. Either decrease the cost of lootboxes (or Star Cards if you remove lootboxes), or increase the credit reward at the end of matches. Additionally, Crafting parts need to be easier to acquire and more plentiful, so that we  can choose which Star Cards that we want to upgrade, rather than having to submit to lootcrate RNG.  We want to feel like we\u2019re making progress in the game, and it currently takes way too long to unlock Star Cards and Upgrades. \n\n3. The credit reward at the end of matches should be proportional to the player\u2019s score. The better the player does in the game, the greater the credit reward should be. The current system encourages players to draw out every match for as long as possible, and rewards AFK players. (Note: We want the credit reward to be a SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE of the score, similarly to Battlefront 2015. Rewarding the top players on the leaderboard with a small bonus amount is not a solution to the problem.)\n\nSo here\u2019s our question, and we don\u2019t want a vague answer (I think 700,000 downvotes made that clear): **What are your SPECIFIC responses to these three complaints, and what will you do about them? **\n\nThanks,\nr/starwarsbattlefront and the gaming community of Reddit\n\nEDIT: Shortened length \n\nResponse to #3: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv8vi8?st=JA1DI6F1&sh=0b9c3c74https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv8vi8?st=JA1DI6F1&sh=0b9c3c74\n\nResponse to #2: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv9rbq?st=JA1ELUG1&sh=6ea14123https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv9rbq?st=JA1ELUG1&sh=6ea14123\n\nResponse to #1: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv9cio?st=JA1DR8DW&sh=e10d7076https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/comment/dpv9cio?st=JA1DR8DW&sh=e10d7076",

I think that alone speaks volumes about what you guys as a company (DICE and not EA) are trying to do.  \n\nI am a full time employee and have other responsibilities outside of work that take up a lot of my time. Gaming for me and I assume many others is a hobby for me. Hobbies require money and time to make them enjoyable.  My questions relate to my lifestyle and I'm sure many others that don't call themselves professional gamers. \n\n1. Is it incorrect for me to assume that EA and DICE set the credit requirements before all the backlash knowing that it would be unpopular? Knowing full well you could reduce the credit requirements and make EA out to be the \"hero.\"\n\n2. I have loved DICE as a developer since the Bad Company 1 days. And I've always bought every madden and have largely been okay with EA until they started their current business practices with lootboxes and microtransactions. My question is do you as a company have the ability to take the loot crates and microtransactions out of the game entirely? As stated before I have other responsibilities in life both that require my time and money. So I don't have unlimited amounts of either to spend on your game after I've already spent $60. \n\n3. My last question is if DICE as a company can't stand up to EA and tell them that you will not include loot crates and microtransactions in your games then where does it stop for you? I can't imagine Lucasfilm and Disney would be okay with the negative publicity this game has gotten with regards to how EA has made this game into a money centered game that takes advantage of me as a gamer/consumer. My only hope, if these things aren't taken out of the game entirely is that Disney pulls the Star Wars property from EA once and for all. ",

The gameplay of this battlefront is awesome, the 4 classes adding a lot of depth into tactical gameplay, but there is no way to fully enjoy it by playing with partner or team. \nIn more than 20h I NEVER saw a random squad playing together and it's quite obvious this will never work. \nPLEASE reconsider that system. \nThe maps are large and spawn randomly on the battlefield and really far from the front and your teammates/partners don't give any possibility to play with them (They die before you can join them for example). This is something you really should improve. => Is it something you will do in the future ?\n\n- The lack of Conquest/Supremacy mode is so much disappointing. I can't understand WHY this is not in the game. Galactic assault is great but unbalanced. You defend OR you attack that's all. It always feels the same, because it finishes quickly on the first or second step of the main objectives. It doesn't take much time and we can't enjoy the full map. \nIf I played so much hours in Battlefront 2015, it's because Supremacy was great. The mode was always intense, gave freedom to every player to play the way he likes (attack, defense, vehicules, etc) and also provided each camp with a symetric start ! \n=> So my question about this is:  do you consider adding a symetric mode like Conquest or Supremacy (other than HvV) soon in the game ?\n\nI can't wait to fully explore the maps, capture posts, and play with my team.

While I\u2019m sure a lot of us would love to see things like Bespin or Extraction on Jabba\u2019s Palace make a return, we\u2019d feel a bit cheated if they were to take the place of a brand new map or planet. So I suppose what I\u2019m really asking is if we do see content from the first game added, will it be instead of new content or will it have no effect on your plans for new content drops?\n\n\n2: Can you speak more specifically about how credits are earned in matches? After playing for a while I\u2019m still unable to really gauge how they\u2019re allocated, in fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say they\u2019re inconsistent. I\u2019ve had scores ranging from ~1000 to 18000 and the widest range of credits I\u2019ve earned is only 100-400.  Is that proportional to my performance, is it an average of my team\u2019s performance? If possible, it\u2019d be nice to get an in-depth breakdown on how credits are earned with respects to those factors.\n\n3: \nWhat kind of long term support will we get for this game, long after the servers have been deactivated and live support has ended? The lack of a full fledged skirmish mode in both this game and the last doesn\u2019t bode well for being able to fully experience this game offline in the future. The arcade mode right now, for what it is, is fine but it doesn\u2019t offer us modes or chained objectives and feels more like a blast match with some tweakable values. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re limited as what you can say specifically but I feel like we all need reassurance that a decade down the line we\u2019ll be able to partake in an experience that is if not 1:1, an accurate simulacrum of the online multiplayer experience. \n\nThank you for your time. \n",

        "body": "Hey guys, thanks for the ama. I'm sure there will be lots of people asking questions regarding hero prices, lootboxes and credit gain, so I will try to focus on topics less people are talking about.\n\nYou talked multiple times about the fact that Battlefront II will be a continous effort with years of additional development and I think frequent communication is very important in order to ensure success. This leads me to my first question.\n\n1) Will you increase communication with the community and regularly discuss and answer questions on reddit?\n\nI realize that it can be dangerous for developers to openly talk about controversial topics, however we see more and more companies adapting a more \"open\" style. When I played League of Legends years ago, I was impressed by how active employees of Riot Games were talking about the game in their subreddit. Epic Games and Psyonix are really active in the Fortnite and Rocket League subreddits, too. Developers are stepping in daily to discuss things. While I appreciate you hosting this ama, I want to ensure that you keep talking to us on a regular basis. I realize that this sub is in a kinda toxic state right now with the huge influx of people who primarily visit this sub because of the recent media attention but I'm sure it will get better. Even though there are lots of people sharing their rather unconstructive opinions, I hope you realize that most people still greatly appreciate your development efforts and that everyone just wants to have a great game. Sometimes all it takes is a simple \"feedback noted\", most of us really appreciate communication. Incidentally I wanted to give a huge shoutout to /u/petervesti and /u/ShadowXJ who frequently step in to discuss the game with us and update us on all kinds of topics!\n\nNext, I want to talk about something regarding progression few people seem to talk about: The star card upgrading requirements. Personally I really dislike the fact that players are forced to get other star cards before being able to upgrade to higher rarities. \n\n2) Are there any changes planned regarding the class star card level requirement when upgrading cards to higher rarities? Maybe you could elaborate on the design goals.\n\nThe credit costs for trooper crates seem unreasonably high, it seems to be more economically viable to buy other crates and simply use the contained crafting parts to buy / upgrade the cards you want. However, instead of simply upgrading three star cards that fit my playstyle, I have to get other cards first in order to increase my card level. I understand the non class / card based global level requirement which prevents new players who spend money on crates from directly upgrading everything but I don't understand why my card level needs to be 15 before I'm able to upgrade a card I want to use from uncommon to rare. Trooper classes share most of the boost cards, so if I want to use the card which makes you earn more battlepoints with more than one class it feels really bad to grind out card level 15 multiple times with different classes just to upgrade the same card to rare again. So many resources wasted. The intention seems to be to at least partially slow down the player from progressing too fast. This design seems counterproductive, on the one side people who spend money on lootcrates are restricted from progressing too fast by the global level requirement, on the other site people who spend money will have a higher card level which leads to them being able to upgrade cards faster. You might argue that getting the player to try other cards might be one of the design goals but I'm sure there would be more elegant solutions for that.\n\nThanks again for the ama and thanks again for developing the game. Altough there are some problems, the core gameplay is fun. I hope you continue to improve and adress the problems people are having with the game.",

For example, arcade mode gives credits away to players but after a couple of matches players are given a timer for when credits can be earned again. There's also the campaign that gives out 5,000 credits when completed. Another example is players who win MVP in a match will only get around 300 credits vs a player who struggles in a match will get around 300 credits or more than the MVP.\n\n2) Do you stand by the decision to have had Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker behind a 60,000 credit paywall when the progression/currency system gave out little credits? \n\n3) Many players are worried about lootcrates being used for a P2W (pay 2 win) system because lootcrates give out rare star cards and credits that can be used for unlocking heroes. Will the game see some changes to lootcrates such as giving away comestics, collectibles, unlocking challenges, and/or huut contracts instead of rare star cards/credits? \n\nOptional 4) Will the community ever see something similar to Galactic Conquest from the original Battlefront games?\n\nThank you for your time and I hope you have a great day! The blacklash from the last couple of days isn't about players wantinh everything for feee or being entitled. It's just that the community is worried about this game being P2W instead of fun.

Dynamic AI. Simulation of not just physics, but other real-world concepts. Where. Are. These. Things. At?!????!!?!\n\nAs a thought experiment, imagine Skyrim -- a game a lot of people have played. Picture Skyrim but with a survival mod that introduces hunger, thirst, and sleep requirements.\n\nNow imagine a version of Skyrim where every NPC needed to adhere to those needs as well as you do, and so they would need to go hunting or get some income source to acquire items that satiate those survival needs -- the method they choose to do that could maybe depend on a degree of RNG, but also take into account their own stats, progression in skills, moral standing/outlook, etc.\n\nSome NPCs may choose to work for someone else, some may become bandits, some may climb the social ladder in their city to try and establish themselves as noble families or gain important positions in the Jarl's court. Maybe certain high-level characters would try and form new cities and become new Jarls.\n\nSome may choose to form their own shops; for instance, an NPC with high Smithing skill and high Speech skill might want to form a weapon & armor shop.\n\nHowever, that NPC would first need to have enough gold to buy or commission the construction of their physical shop.\n\nThen, they would need some money to buy ore from a company of NPCs that actually go and mine the game's various metals (dwemer, moonstone, steel, ebony, etc) from mines littered throughout the world.\n\nAfter that, they would need to hire a mage NPC with enchanting skill, smelt the ore into ingots, get their hands on the leather somehow, and basically craft all the gear they want to sell (including enchantments) from scratch.\n\nAnd of course, the player would be able to follow any of these paths as well.\n\nThere wouldn't even need to be traditional \"main quest\"-type linear stories in a game like this, because the interplay of these systems would *create* stories. The story would come and *find you* -- something sorely needed in an open world game -- because its dynamic nature means everything you do would really have an impact and can potentially get you swept up in other people's drama.\n\nMaybe there wouldn't be as much voice-acting due to how many different possible situations there could be, but the narrative in Elder Scrolls games has always kind of sucked anyway and the writing and dialog are usually godawful too.\n\nBasically, it would be like an RPG that's set inside a dynamic world where cities basically function like AI players in an RTS. They would get bigger and more advanced as laws impact the citizenry, who in turn impact the economy. And the citzenry itself would grow and become more advanced, as the individual NPCs therein would try to pair off with each other and reproduce once they reach a certain threshold of comfort ahead of their survival needs...kind of like in real life.\n\nMonsters and beasts would have similar dynamics, where they would reproduce, form communities, choose places to nest, require food and water for survival, etc.\n\nWhen monster populations get out of control due to these mechanics (or similarly, when bandit populations get out of control due to a failing economy), they would start attacking people and/or ruining their farms/shops/houses/whatever. You could go to those NPCs who were affected and if your speech skill and/or combat-oriented skill is high enough, you can get a quest from them to stop the attacks -- for a reward that that NPC will determine dynamically based on his or her own survival needs.\n\nAnd lastly...there would be no load times to go anywhere in this game.\n\nNow imagine if accommodating all of this functionality required a downgrade to Gamecube-level graphical presentation, or maybe even worse. Imagine if it looked like Final Fantasy Tactics on PSX, which had 2D sprites in a 3D environment. \n\nWould you still buy it? Because THIS is the type of stuff 2007 me thought we would be seeing in games 10 years in the future. THIS is the direction I thought the next generation of games would head in back then. \n\nEven when Skyrim came out back in 2011 and Bethesda started talking about their \"Radiant Story\" system, I thought that system would look something like what I'm describing here -- yet it never came even close to being as dynamic as it could have been.\n\nAnd now in 2017, AAA games are *still* basically prettier and more aggressively monetized versions of the same exact types of straightforward gaming experiences we had 10+ years in the past. Where the hell is all the innovation going? *I* have good ideas. I'm sure plenty of *other* people have good ideas.

I feel that's where the issue is with our game right now and that's where we'll look to solve as quickly as we can. We're looking to add additional ways to progress your favorite character or class, while allowing crates to be a fun thing for those who want to engage with them.\n\n- 2: from /u/d_FireWall : Yes, always. We are always going to be looking at the system from the back end, making changes depending on how we see people progressing. If it looks as though the crafting parts aren't being given out quickly enough, we'll look into changes to fix that. We know our players are looking for more direct paths in getting the thing they really want, so we'll look to provide that as quickly as we can.\n\n- 2: from /u/WazDICE : Regarding the second part of this question: We're constantly looking at the rate that players are unlocking Crates and Star Cards and will continue adjusting values to make sure that players are able to progress towards their goals without it feeling like a grind. We're also going to be adjusting end of match rewards as we revisit the system to reward people differently based on the way they play.\n\n- 3: from u/TheVestalViking : Right now Credits you earn in-match DO take into account your performance. It also takes into account the time you've spent in-match. Currently it's skewed more towards your time spent in-game and we have some work to do to make it more clear that your performance does impact your Credit earn. This change was done prior to Launch - something that happened just before I was interviewed by Angry Joe and I missed the update since I was travelling - sorry for the confusion! Regardless, this is something that we're looking to continue to improve on both in presentation and via more ways to reward you for different styles of play.\n\n---\n\n# Personally, I am very underwhelmed by these answers.\n\nAlso, as a *massive* Star Wars fan, it hurts my heart that my most upvoted comment is about how dissapointed I am with a new Star Wars game.

        "body": "First of all, we as a community would like to thank you for putting so much effort into Star Wars Battlefront II. We want you to know that we are so passionately critical of the game because we genuinely want it to be good, and are exited to play it. However, we don\u2019t want the gameplay to be ruined by a slow progression system that gives advantages to players who buy micro-transactions. While Battlefront II isn\u2019t technically pay-to-win, it IS pay-to-save-a-large-amount-of-time.\n\nWe don\u2019t want you to fall to the darkside.\n\nThese are our biggest requests:\n\n1. Lootboxes should be removed. These ruin the feeling of accomplishment, are a form of gambling, and are obviously an incentive for players to buy credits using micro-transactions. Currently, Battlefront feels like a free mobile game, not a $60-$80 AAA title. There should be absolutely no micro-transactions that affect progression. While we recognize that you need money to continue creating free DLC, it should not come at the expense of fair gameplay. A compromise can be limiting lootboxes to cosmetic items only, so you can still make money.\n\n2. Players should receive enough credits to purchase Star Cards after every hour of playtime. That\u2019s about 2-3 rounds of Galactic Assault. Either decrease the cost of lootboxes (or Star Cards if you remove lootboxes), or increase the credit reward at the end of matches. Additionally, Crafting parts need to be easier to acquire and more plentiful, so that we can choose which Star Cards that we want to upgrade, rather than having to submit to lootcrate RNG. We want to feel like we\u2019re making progress in the game, and it currently takes way too long to unlock Star Cards and Upgrades.\n\n3. The credit reward at the end of matches should be proportional to the player\u2019s score. The better the player does in the game, the greater the credit reward should be. The current system encourages players to draw out every match for as long as possible, and rewards AFK players. (Note: We want the credit reward to be a SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE of the score, similarly to Battlefront 2015. Rewarding the top players on the leaderboard with a small bonus amount is not a solution to the problem.)\n\nSo here\u2019s our question, and we don\u2019t want a vague answer (I think 700,000 downvotes made that clear): What are your SPECIFIC responses to these three complaints, and what will you do about them?",
