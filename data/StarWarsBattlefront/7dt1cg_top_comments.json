We would have to wait a solid 10 minutes before we could start a match, and even then, we would get consistently kicked back to the main menu.  And for whatever reason, when this would happen, our party would become glitched, so now we wouldn't be able to rejoin each other, or just try to start a new match.  So we would try disbanding the group and rejoining each, but apparently that didn't work either, just the same result.  The only solution we found that worked was QUITTING THE GAME AND STARTING OVER AGAIN.  And this didn't happen just once or twice!  This was a constant problem we faced, during the 10 hours we spent playing the game.\n\nAlong with the pain of joining a game, heroes are simply ridiculous in galactic assault.  I feel like heroes were handled pretty well by pandemic, and even in the first ea battlefront, because they had a limited health bar.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but in this one, it seems that their health regenerates, which drains the match of all fun.  Hero players all of a sudden rack up insane scores/eliminations, and are exceptionally survivable.  This is before you get a 4 stack of heroes fighting you!  Once heroes start teaming up on objectives, there is absolutely no hope of possibly winning.  If DICE has any intention of balancing the game, they need to take a hard look at the state of heroes, possibly reduce the amount you can have in match at once as well.",

People don't like getting shit on by kids who have more time to unlock shit that make them OP.

It got pretty damn well received since it was an excellent game.\n\nIn 2005 a sequel was released. \"Star Wars Battlefront II\". Might not seem like long but development times have gotten longer as the years went on, but it was mostly the same game at it's core, but with a lot more polish, maps, tweaked and improved gameplay and of course, space battles! It's a classic and has one -hell- of a fanbase.\n\nIn 2015 EA announced \"Star Wars Battlefront\". People had been clambering for a HD remake of Battlefront II for quite a while and it seemed EA had finally listened! Well the Beta happened and while some were pleased with it, a lot were left dissapointed. Even if we discount the people who dislike the game, it launched in a questionable state and was severely lacking on content, including completely lacking a campaign or single player so was charging full price for the multiplayer only.\n\nIn 2017 \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" got announced, with EA and Dice promising it as the apology for 2015's offering, and that they would make good on their promises and make it up to those who were dissapointed. I assume you know what happens next since you're here :P\n\n2004 - Star Wars Battlefront\n\n2005 - Star Wars Battlefront II\n\n2015 - Star Wars Battlefront\n\n2017 - Star Wars Battlefront II\n\nAll of them different games.\n\nSo technically you could argue that the new one is Battlefront 4, except there were a couple of PSP exclusive ones after Pandemic left so maybe more like 6 or 7. Except they're just called Battlefront and Battlefront II in order to make money off the brand name. It's like when Syndicate got remade into a first person shooter, also called Syndicate. Or when DOOM got remade as DOOM (Admitedly that one was -fucking- excellent) Reboots of series but giving the reboot the same name as the original aren't new and they -still- mess up peoples filing systems :<",
