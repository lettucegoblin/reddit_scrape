' Uh... im not sure about ps4/pc and/or other country but here in canada and on xbox thing such as microsoft point card exist to bypass the need for a credit card AND purchasing limited fund credit card is a thing aswell which does not require you to be 18 or over to purchase.\n\nMy little cousin can literaly go to the nearby 7/11 style store (we call them Depanneur here since they are mainly shop on the go to help you and refuel your car) and purchase a 40$ prepaid credit card to buy stuff in his facebook or xbox game.\n\n'A player\u2019s ability to succeed in the game is not dependent on purchasing crates.' While true this is a double edge blade, You do not require to purchase crate/boxes to succeed and evne can earn them so by playing but the game is made as such you are pressed to purchase them to drasticly reduce the time needed to achieve want you want.  There was calculation done pretty much showing that to unlock i think everything you would require roughly 4000 or more hours OR 2000 or more dollar. Im not a smart man but doing some quick math that doesn't even come close to a dollar an hour so you can easly see the design made to use real money to realy reduce the time you need to spend to work toward your objective for your stuff to enjoy the game as you want it.\n\n' We think of it as a similar principle to collectible card games' It cute that they want absolutely nothing to do with gambling but they want to be looked at like tcg... except they are absolutely different to tcg except in the concept of opening a package for random outcome. TCG is a physical good which you can trade and sell back for value greater,equal or lesser to which you purchased it for, be it from another person or from a store owner or have acquired from said random outcome package. In this case most boxes/crates provide ingame good which you often cannot sell or trade to other player and trading to the owner (in this case the game) will result most time in another currency used to craft other goods but often at quite the reduced rate, you can usualy never get back the premium currency and that premium currency can never be turned back into money.\n\nFrom recent knowledge the only game where that was remotely possible was CSGO and see how that turned out, the moment it was possible to do trade for possibly real currency it was shutdown. Hell on another note blizzard tried that real auction house stuff which lived for a bit before being closed due to most likely multiple hassle and problem and etc.\n\nSo pretty much they wanna be looked at like TCG but when it start looking a bit too much like TCG (mostly when money return to player get involved)it crosses a line and trouble start coming in. The only different thing here is that player will most likely never get possible money return unless they involve a third party and has to do with the selling of the whole account. The predatory measure, the feeling of up and down associated to gambling and the dependency it cause are all real and all there.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Like the headline and great read but couple of stuff annoy me.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;EA points out that Battlefront II has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, and any purchases would require a valid credit card. &#39; Uh... im not sure about ps4/pc and/or other country but here in canada and on xbox thing such as microsoft point card exist to bypass the need for a credit card AND purchasing limited fund credit card is a thing aswell which does not require you to be 18 or over to purchase.</p>\n\n<p>My little cousin can literaly go to the nearby 7/11 style store (we call them Depanneur here since they are mainly shop on the go to help you and refuel your car) and purchase a 40$ prepaid credit card to buy stuff in his facebook or xbox game.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;A player\u2019s ability to succeed in the game is not dependent on purchasing crates.&#39; While true this is a double edge blade, You do not require to purchase crate/boxes to succeed and evne can earn them so by playing but the game is made as such you are pressed to purchase them to drasticly reduce the time needed to achieve want you want.  There was calculation done pretty much showing that to unlock i think everything you would require roughly 4000 or more hours OR 2000 or more dollar. Im not a smart man but doing some quick math that doesn&#39;t even come close to a dollar an hour so you can easly see the design made to use real money to realy reduce the time you need to spend to work toward your objective for your stuff to enjoy the game as you want it.</p>\n\n<p>&#39; We think of it as a similar principle to collectible card games&#39; It cute that they want absolutely nothing to do with gambling but they want to be looked at like tcg... except they are absolutely different to tcg except in the concept of opening a package for random outcome. TCG is a physical good which you can trade and sell back for value greater,equal or lesser to which you purchased it for, be it from another person or from a store owner or have acquired from said random outcome package. In this case most boxes/crates provide ingame good which you often cannot sell or trade to other player and trading to the owner (in this case the game) will result most time in another currency used to craft other goods but often at quite the reduced rate, you can usualy never get back the premium currency and that premium currency can never be turned back into money.</p>\n\n<p>From recent knowledge the only game where that was remotely possible was CSGO and see how that turned out, the moment it was possible to do trade for possibly real currency it was shutdown. Hell on another note blizzard tried that real auction house stuff which lived for a bit before being closed due to most likely multiple hassle and problem and etc.</p>\n\n<p>So pretty much they wanna be looked at like TCG but when it start looking a bit too much like TCG (mostly when money return to player get involved)it crosses a line and trouble start coming in. The only different thing here is that player will most likely never get possible money return unless they involve a third party and has to do with the selling of the whole account. The predatory measure, the feeling of up and down associated to gambling and the dependency it cause are all real and all there.</p>\n</div>",

Of course your chances of winning is greater with an unlocked Darth Vader than as a Stormtrooper. So I wish people would stop even debating that. The Star Card upgrades even provide several _tiers_ of improving your chances. Because EA wants to have it so that even if you bought a few Star Cards, a person who bought several will still be even better.\n\n**Claim 2:** _\"Spent time reap the rewards for free.\"_\n\nEA's main safety valve here seems to be that you can spend time and reap the same rewards as if purchased. That is true. However, it is also true that the system is set up, for example by showing which Star Cards people have used in the match when you die, so that you will urgently want to spend money rather than play.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt may not be gambling in the traditional sense, but then again, a computer game is not a slot machine. Maybe it is the regulations that need to be updated? It would be about time in a day and age when it's everyday news where children have been abusing credit cards for pay-to-win games. Until then, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is simply a game supported by a dirty business model and should absolutely be treated as such in reviews and by would-be customers.\n\nA final, personal tip: GOG just released a [cheap DRM-free Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005 version)](https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_battlefront_ii) where you can play ~30 ground and space vehicles, several heroes and character classes, in a ton of environments for $10. :-) (ultrawide displays and large 20+ multiplayer battles poorly supported -- the Skirmishes though!) I shall keep an eye on this game for changes, but I think this game is honestly not a big deal to miss out on in its current state. I know it would just make me upset if I let it consume me, and that introspection makes this decision much easier. There are many great games out there.",

But other times you\u2019ll end up with a pack of cards you already have.\"\n\nIt seems pretty similar to collecting baseball cards growing up.  Sometimes I'd get  great one and way more often it would be \"oh, another obscure player that I've never even heard of\".  \n\nIs the issue that the items you might get in the loot boxes - and can't get any other way - are *required* to complete the game rather than some very rare skin or other similar item? (sorry for some game mechanics ignorance here.  While I'm in IT, I don't game at all).\n\n",
