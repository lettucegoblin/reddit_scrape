        "body": "Belgian redditor here, here's a [link](http://www.gamingcommission.fgov.be/opencms/opencms/jhksweb_en/law/law/index.html) to the Belgian Gaming Commission's Gaming Act of 7 May 1999.\n\nFrom what I understand, of importance here is article 2 of said law, namely the definition of a \"game of chance\":\n\n> Article 2. For the purposes of the application of this Act and its implementing decrees, the following terms shall apply:\n\n> 1. games of chance: any game by which a stake of any kind is committed, the consequence of which is either loss of the stake by at least one of the players or a gain of any kind in favour of at least one of the players, or organisers of the game and in which chance is a factor, albeit ancillary, for the conduct of the game, determination of the winner or fixing of the gain;\n\nIf they rule that this definition applies, then by extension so does the law. Which means EA will have to apply for a permit or face fines. Needless to say they do NOT want this to happen, not because they couldn't afford it, but because of what it would imply.\n\nEDIT:\n\n[Link](https://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/onderzoek-naar-nieuw-star-wars-spel) to the actual news report (Dutch) as well. Major concern is the peer pressure effect among younger audiences. Children and teens see what other people have and are more inclined to spend money because they want the same items. The fact that the items are not merely cosmetic but have a strong impact on gameplay is also brought up (better weapons, more energy...) which adds to the peer pressure.\n\nThis is also the reason why, even though Overwatch is also being investigated, they're very likely to be cleared because as I understand it (I don't play Overwatch myself) their boxes contain only cosmetic goodies.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nSince I'm noticing repeated mention of Pokemon and card games in general, article 3 of the Belgian Gaming Act covers these specifically as not being games of chance:\n\n> Article 3. The following are not games of chance within the meaning of this Act:\n\n> 3. card games or board or parlour games played outside class I and II gaming establishments and games operated in attraction parks or by industrial fairgrounds in connection with carnivals or trade or other fairs and on analogous occasions, including games that are organised occasionally and maximum 4 times a year by a local association for a special event or by an association with a social objective or for charity , or a non-profit organisation with a social objective or for charity, and that only requires a very limited stake and that can procure for the player or better only a low-value material advantage.\n\nIt's important to note that collectibles like Pokemon cards fall under the broad term of card games (\"kaartspelen\") in Belgium, alongside playing Poker at home with your friends for instance.\n\nKeep in mind that these are Belgian laws. I strongly suggest all of you, if you truly care about this issue, look up your own countries' and governments' gambling laws.",

I'm talking the 7 year old who got the game bought by their single mom because she knows he LOVES Star Wars and she works a shitty near minimum wage job like $12/hr(i live in California), so she had to work like 6+ hours to buy the game. \n\nOnly to have that little kid, struggle in the game and not enjoy it because he wants to play a character like Vader and he's faced up against people who've already thrown down hundreds of dollars to get Vader and other skills that make it easier for them.

I've played with a lot of whales (some of them in their 40s, some still teenagers) and hearing them rationalize 'needing' this crap and hearing them egg eachother on over teamspeak was really unsettling.\n\nTheir guild mates all have the fancy mount or the costume or class skin  so they need to have it too (game called trove).\n\nWith gameplay affecting things it's more of the same , just to a more extreme levels. I watched a clanmate in archeage blow almost  thousand dollars on upgrade materials to upgrade his weapon and he ended up destroying it with a failed upgrade. He spent 5 grand that month (I remember it was 5 grand because a patch added reward points based on how much you spent in the cash shop, and he got 5000 dollars worth of spending) . Another clanmate sheepishly admitted on teamspeak that they were spending money that was \"kind of supposed to be for bills hahaha\". I asked them why and they said it's because it makes them feel good.\n\nThat conversation really changed my view on whales, I no longer deride them or see them as completely empty headed consumer sheep-bots who mindlessly buy the shiny thing without a thought.

I&#39;ve played with a lot of whales (some of them in their 40s, some still teenagers) and hearing them rationalize &#39;needing&#39; this crap and hearing them egg eachother on over teamspeak was really unsettling.</p>\n\n<p>Their guild mates all have the fancy mount or the costume or class skin  so they need to have it too (game called trove).</p>\n\n<p>With gameplay affecting things it&#39;s more of the same , just to a more extreme levels. I watched a clanmate in archeage blow almost  thousand dollars on upgrade materials to upgrade his weapon and he ended up destroying it with a failed upgrade. He spent 5 grand that month (I remember it was 5 grand because a patch added reward points based on how much you spent in the cash shop, and he got 5000 dollars worth of spending) . Another clanmate sheepishly admitted on teamspeak that they were spending money that was &quot;kind of supposed to be for bills hahaha&quot;. I asked them why and they said it&#39;s because it makes them feel good.</p>\n\n<p>That conversation really changed my view on whales, I no longer deride them or see them as completely empty headed consumer sheep-bots who mindlessly buy the shiny thing without a thought.

        "body": "Unfortunately the gaming community often tends to be poor in articulating the real insidious nature of these microtransaction schemes, which has lead to the media not understanding what the actual issue is. People outside the community see this as gamers being upset at EA (once again for the 500th time) over specific heroes or guns or how long you must play to become Darth Vader in a game....but that's not what the core issue is.\n\nThe actual issue we have to communicate is that the entire game is created to be just a lure to get you into a virtual gambling Skinner Box.\n\nThe science of addiction and compulsive behavior was well studied since the 1950s, in what is known as an \"Operant conditioning chamber\", now frequently referred to as a \"Skinner Box\" in honor of its creator. It has an \"operandum\" (also called \"response lever\" in rat based experiments) that when activated feeds some reward for performing the action, conditioning the organism to continually activate the operandum. In various ways you can teach subjects to nearly automatically react in a desired way by offering them strategic hits of dopamine.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber\n\nJust like in the famous Skinner Box experiments, you can be manipulated into doing the digital equivalent of hitting a response lever by feeding money into the microtransaction store, exploiting human psychological quirks with positive and negative reinforcement tricks that are built into the progression system. \n\nAnd the entire game was designed around this concept:\n\n1.) **Battlefront II exploits an automatic addiction response by using randomized rewards with its loot boxes.**\n\nIts well known within the field of psychology that the most effective form of positive feedback is unpredictable positive feedback. Back in the 1950s the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner discovered the addictive effectiveness of the [\"variable schedule of rewards\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement) phenomenon. Skinner observed that lab mice trained to press a lever responded most voraciously to random rewards, and in the most compulsive manner. Casinos and other gambling establishments have known this for a while, and have created random reward schemes to exploit this.\n\nThis is exactly what Battlefront II does, turning it into a gambling proposition by putting the gameplay features people want behind a randomized reward lootbox scheme.\n\n2) **The game was designed to be tedious and to make progression not tied to skill, but how many lootboxes you get**\n\nIt was worked out that a player would need to grind for 4,528 hours in order to unlock everything. The progression system is purposefully set to push people towards buying lootboxes as its not skill based: It doesn't truly matter if you get 1 kill or 50 kills, you're getting roughly the same low amount of credits. The scrap that you can collect is designed to be an impractical way to progress, as I would need to grind for hours just to get 600 scrap gun. With each match earning only about 200-300 credits, it would take many hours to get one single Trooper Crate to roll the dice with the hopes of getting something worthwhile. Even worse there are limits in terms of how many credits one can get in Arcade mode per day. In other EA games like Battlefield, more experienced players can unlock a variety of weapons, items, and perks, but generally, they add gameplay styles, not mathematical advantages. But every single Star Card and every bump in a Star Card's tier only adds boosts to each class' default loadout, with only a few of these fairer \"mathematically equivalent\" unlockables. As if that wasn't enough, your ability to unlock two extra card slots in the game is based around reaching a certain card level, only achievable by obtaining more cards. Battlefront II seems adamant to disregard the value of players\u2019 time, demanding a huge amount of commitment for rewards that feel wholly insignificant for the investment required to earn them.\n\n3) **The game was designed to highlight the benefits of gambling on the loot box rewards.**\n\nWith each death on the battlefield, players see which cards their opponent is using - a design choice that is meant to plant the idea within the gamer of how \u201cI need to get those cards.\u201d The high level cards change the game so much that playing against them makes it hard to to level up, earn crates, and craft better gear. I was continually dominated by better geared players. The game goes out of its way to show you that players who bought better gear are the successful ones.\n\n4)  **The game places arbitrary limits and complexity on progression in order to incentivize lootbox purchases**\n\nRather than narrow all of this down to a single currency or unlock model, EA has already created this complex schism of multiple currencies and progressions and what each can and cannot do. For example you also have a card level, which is meant to limit your ability to craft high powered cards. But the card level is determined by the number of cards you have. I can't imagine any reason this was done but to confuse the casual player, and further steer them towards the easy solution of buying lootboxes.\n\nThis game is like a slot machine, except you don't win money.\n\nAnd a massive amount of parents will rush out to buy it for their children without realizing what they are buying.\n\n",

Heroes is f2p, so not a perfect translation, but you unlock a loot box every level up, and depending on a few factors, they modify the\"winning\" percentage in the player's favor: every 5 boxes, you get a 'rare' box, guaranteed to have a rare drop; every 25, it's a legendary plus 150 gems (the premium in game currency).  Additionally, every 10 levels with specific heroes, you get a box guaranteed to drop something for that hero.  It's also worth mentioning that ALL unlocks are cosmetic, and that is fairly easy to grind almost anything in the store.  Destiny 2 just scales everything to your level, so the loot is, at worst, basically the same as you already have, usually a slight improvement.  The drop rates are high, and almost any in game activity meaningfully progresses you towards loot, including random chest just sprinkled throughout the game world.  You don't really grind so much as just keep playing the game, whether that's story missions, raids, PvP or just roaming around - whatever your cup of tea is, the game rewards you pretty handsomely for doing it.\n\nLoot boxes aren't inherently evil, the same way gambling isn't inherently evil - they can both be a fun addition to an experience.  But they have to be done in a way that fair, doesn't break the game play, and always secondary to the the experience of the game.  Battlefront violates all of those rules though, and has earned every bit of the back lash they're receiving.",

A video game doesn&#39;t suddenly create a killer.</p>\n\n<p>A video game with RNG rewards like lootboxes, however, does psychologically hook players into doing it more. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d70fg/belgiums_gambling_regulators_are_investigating/dpvlod2/\">/u/arsonbunny describes this in-depth here.</a></p>\n\n<p>While no, this isn&#39;t suddenly going to predispose someone to travelling to Vegas... it <em>will</em> hook them into spending more and more on lootboxes. Just like nickle-and-diming, small microtransactions, things people don&#39;t mind... &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a small purchase, no big deal.&quot; Then they get another one... and sometime in the future, one more won&#39;t hurt. Or maybe they <em>really</em> want X and the lootboxes haven&#39;t given it to them yet, but surely it&#39;ll happen soon, so they buy a bunch to open at once. And still maybe get nothing worthwhile at all.</p>\n\n<p>And whether a child or not, an addiction to forking over money hoping for a nice reward is not good for anyone. I&#39;m fine with basic marketing, but companies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take advantage of people to that degree.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mean christ, as a kid I bought hundreds of booster packs for Magic and Pokemon</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just because a similar marketing tactic was successfully used on you (and your poor parents) during your childhood doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an okay thing.</p>\n</div>",
