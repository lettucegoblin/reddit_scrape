Get ready to grind  for hours every time you obtain something.\"\n\nThis right here is why the people who say 'well just don't buy the microtransactions then but still buy the game' about lootbox games are wrong. If you still buy this game but not a single lootbox it tells EA that you are willing to put up with the arbitrary grind they implemented in a 60 dollar game.\n\nThat means that for EA putting in the lootboxes is a no risk, pure win situation, as they are not losing the part of their customer base that aren't whales and dolphins (those people accepted the shitty grind) AND get to farm all the whales and dolphins. They get to have their greed cake and eat it too, and they get to ruin game design in the process without any consequences.\n\nThe only way to stop this shit is if the gaming community rejects these games completely, until the whales and dolphins have no one to play with anymore.\n\nUntil lootboxes start to carry a real risk of backfiring for these publishers they will only become more and more common. For now it's 'just' EA, Ubisoft, WB, Take 2, and Activision but what do you think is going to happen to that (in your experience) more 'benign' publisher that releases those games you love so much? If they see that this carries no risk and no consequence they will follow too.\n\nEither gamers do something now or within 3-4 years from now the entire game industry is the same as the mobile and browser game one.\n\nAnd if you think your refusal to support this shit is futile then I have a few things to say:\n\n1: Why do you vote? why do you pay taxes? why do you recycle? It's all a drop of water on a hot plate after all, right?\n\n2 : By rejecting the lootbox industry you are creating a separate gaming niche for traditionally monetized games (normal priced game, no bullshit) and as long as that niche exists there will be developers and publishers who choose to tap that instead of trying to compete with publishers like EA. But if you just fall in line and buy these lootbox games instead that niche will not be viable",
