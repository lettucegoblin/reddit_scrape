Elections are decided by voters and ultimatly nothing is official until the electoral college convenes and votes on...December 13th?</p>\n\n<p>But that said, networks always call the election and almost always call it correctly. Waiting for every state to certify their elections before making the call is madness. News media wants to avoid the embarrassment of being wrong and is unlikely to call it unless they are 100% certain their analysis is right. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, the media doesnt decide elections and this technically isnt over for another month, but even so, she is being disingenuous to act like this year is any different than previous elections in this regard</p>\n</div>",
