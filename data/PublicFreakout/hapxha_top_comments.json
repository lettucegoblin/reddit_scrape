We need a strong police force for protection!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>B: \u201cSo then you don\u2019t an AR-15 in your house, right? And banning or at least regulating them would stop a lot of the active shooter situations from ever happening, right?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>C: \u201cNo!! You want to take our guns, so we can\u2019t fight back when you implement your global communist gay agenda! Over my dead body!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>B: ...?</p>\n</div>",
