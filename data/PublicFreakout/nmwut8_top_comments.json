        "body": "A very similar thing like this happened to me around the same age. I loved to ride my bike every where and needed a straw to prop the antenna up on my rc car. I decided I could get one from kfc about 2-3 miles away from my home. On a main road I rode my bmx bike on the sidewalk and a group of young men in their twenties or so was walking towards me. I hopped off the curb and continued along the sidewalk and one man sucker punched the hell out of my left cheek and face. 2 of my teeth moved and I could not close my mouth. Blood coming out. I just looked at them in shock. They took my bike then decided to toss it down the road. I got my bike back skipped kfc and went back home. Told my dad when he came back home a couple hours later.

My brother is actually learning disabled (seems \u2018normal\u2019 on the outside) but functions like a 14 year old despite being 28. Anyway, he lost all his front teeth in the attack. \n\nThen the case got thrown out because all the witnesses were drunk and unreliable and my brother didn\u2019t remember any of it other than waking up with no front teeth in the hospital. \n\nThis story pisses me off so much. The guy later send us $1000 because he felt bad. Like, he was clearly guilty but it couldn\u2019t be proven in court!!!!! And as if $1000 covered the dental cost of losing 4 front teeth.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just a punch. The guy slammed my brothers face into the sidewalk while people nearby were screaming and trying to get him to stop. When he was put in the cop car later he was apparently laughing.\n\nFuck you, ass hole.\n\nEdited: Please don\u2019t contact the person!! The world is huge and there are so many similar names, anyone looking him up could be looking at a totally innocent person!!  My brother is ok, we are ok. And it\u2019s so good seeing Justice served in this Post! \n\nThanks for the support everyone, I wish I had come to Reddit years ago when this had happened and I was still ravenously mad and wouldn\u2019t care about people contacting the guy /or any guy.

There were strangers who saw it and followed the man to a bar and called the cops and made sure he was arrested. My brother is actually learning disabled (seems \u2018normal\u2019 on the outside) but functions like a 14 year old despite being 28. Anyway, he lost all his front teeth in the attack. </p>\n\n<p>Then the case got thrown out because all the witnesses were drunk and unreliable and my brother didn\u2019t remember any of it other than waking up with no front teeth in the hospital. </p>\n\n<p>This story pisses me off so much. The guy later send us $1000 because he felt bad. Like, he was clearly guilty but it couldn\u2019t be proven in court!!!!! And as if $1000 covered the dental cost of losing 4 front teeth.</p>\n\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t just a punch. The guy slammed my brothers face into the sidewalk while people nearby were screaming and trying to get him to stop. When he was put in the cop car later he was apparently laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Fuck you, ass hole.</p>\n\n<p>Edited: Please don\u2019t contact the person!! The world is huge and there are so many similar names, anyone looking him up could be looking at a totally innocent person!!  My brother is ok, we are ok. And it\u2019s so good seeing Justice served in this Post! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the support everyone, I wish I had come to Reddit years ago when this had happened and I was still ravenously mad and wouldn\u2019t care about people contacting the guy /or any guy. But That\u2019s not what I want now</p>\n</div>",

(Normal time to be out in Spain) \n\nI was minding my own business testing my bike around, I felt a bit tired so I decided to sit in a bank. That was my error. \n\nI saw 3  dudes pass by, they were around 21-24 and I was 14 at the time. Didn't really think about it. After I had lost visual contact they made a 180 turn when I couldn't see them. (Police later explained they do that to check there is no one around.) They came directly towards me so I assumed they wanted to test my bike because lots of people had asked previously or maybe ask for a lighter or something. \n\nTo my surprise 1 of them started slapping me really hard repeatedly while saying: give me your phone. The others were checking no one was coming and kinda putting pressure over me by saying all kind of insults, shouting \"\u00a1r\u00e1pido r\u00e1pido r\u00e1pido!\" Which translates to \"fast fast fast!\" or \"go go go!\" \n\nAt first it was so hard to process what was going on, I couldn't believe that was really happening to me. It had to be some kind of joke, but it wasn't. I remember getting up because I abruptly changed my state of mind and tried to show him how I didn't have any phone with me (I was instinctively lying and I don't know why) I realised I towered at least 1 head and a half over him. But I was incapable of doing anything because my head was still processing. He got more violent after that, grabbed my jacket by the neck area and pushed my against the bank I was sitting. (All of this while he kept slapping me) I covered my face with my hands for a few seconds, spotted an old  couple walking their dog on the distance and used all the energy I could to call for help and get their attention. \n\nThey immediately run away and I was left there in shock. The couple came towards me and we called the police. \n\nAbout 2 months after that the police told me to go on a photo recognition session, I identified 2/3 so sadly they couldn't do anything. (You forget a lot in 2 months and they were 3 in such a situation)\n\nThe day right after that happened I didn't want to go outside anymore, It was hard to acquired enough confidence. I'm 19 now and since that happened I'm much more aware of my surroundings, unable to stand still without moving when outside and more suspicious of strangers. Everytime I see a stranger when walking down the street it kinda sets my alarm and I imagine how to reply in case he tries to assault me. That definitely put an after and before in me.

Typically it\u2019s just used for when someone has multiple felonies that aren\u2019t violent or sexual in nature. A lot of times if a drug charged is involved they will attribute the crimes to addiction and run the sentence concurrent because giving a drug addict 3 consecutive 5 year sentences for stealing cars is severe and a tax on the system. Also repeat offenders are much more likely to receive consecutive sentences because they refuse to rehabilitate/change. All that being said this asshole should have got consecutive. </p>\n\n<p>As a side note from an ex drug addict who has been to prison and is currently sober and a productive member of society I have to agree with some sentences being concurrent. I received 4 years quite a few felonies. With consecutive sentences I would have been lucky to get 20 years. That would have crushed me.</p>\n</div>",
