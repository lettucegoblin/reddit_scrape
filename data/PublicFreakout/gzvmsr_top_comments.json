This is not an excuse for any individual who commits a crime, and if they do they should be punished.\n\nWhat Im saying is PARTIALLY what I have heard on reddit recently already, police need to be reformed, demilitarized and to some degree defunded.\n\nBut its important to look at the police as a whole in their current form as a symptom of  larger problems, one being class oppression. I dont mean to trivialize the racism that occurs, because its there and blacks and other minorities deal with that far too much.\n\nWhat Im saying is when police enter the force, they ARE trained to view the world in a groupthink kind of way, the way other police do, and if they dont theyll probably get kicked out in some way or another.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMaybe I can approach what I want to say another way.  Im looking to the future, (and also to countries like maybe norway or sweden?)  and imagining what good cops in america would look like and how I would want to support the cops.\n\nI would want cops to get more and proper training, and be payed more, and not allow people to be rejected for having too high of an IQ.  I would want parts of their job moved to other people, like responding to mental health calls or whatever, Im not an expert but Ive seen suggested lists that I could find that made a lot of sense.\n\nI want some sort of insurance system:\n\n>Require malpractice insurance. Doctors must pay for insurance in case they botch a surgery, police officers should do the same for botching a police raid or other use of force. If human decency won\u2019t motivate police to respect human life, perhaps hitting their wallet might.\n\nHow I'm imagining it is that the city police force has to cover a large chunk of the malpractice insurance and the individual cops will get a percentage deducted from their pay.  This way, if a cop has killed someone, or has 45 complaints on their record or whatever, the money that the city would have to pay would be so high that they wouldnt want anything to do with that cop and fire him immediately.\n\nAll the quotes are from an article ill link below.\n\n>No more qualified immunity. Police officers should be personally liable for all decisions they make in the line of duty.\n\n>No more civil asset forfeiture. Did you know that every year, citizens like you lose more cash and property to unaccountable civil asset forfeiture than to all burglaries combined? The police can steal your stuff without charging you with a crime and it makes some police departments very rich.\n\n>Break the power of police unions. Police unions make it nearly impossible to fire bad cops and incentivize protecting them to protect the power of the union. A police union is not a labor union; police officers are powerful state agents, not exploited workers.\n\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@OfcrACab/confessions-of-a-former-bastard-cop-bb14d17bc759",
