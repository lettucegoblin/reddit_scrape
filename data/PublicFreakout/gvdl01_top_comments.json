        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>What does it mean when <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/c0x2s6/filthy_cops_with_a_massive_urge_to_commit_murder/er8vxz0/\">socialists say that all cops are bastards?</a></p>\n\n<p>If it were an individual thing, you&#39;d give them the benefit of the doubt, but it isn&#39;t; <strong>it&#39;s an institutional thing</strong>. The job itself is a bastard, therefore by carrying out the job, they are bastards. To take it to an extreme: there were no good members of the gestapo, because there was no way to carry out the directives of the gestapo and to be a good person. it is the same with the american police state. the job of the police is not to protect and serve, but to dominate, control, and terrorize in order to maintain the interests of state and capital.</p>\n\n<p>Who are the good cops then? The ones who either quit or are fired for refusing to do the job.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>cops across the nation constantly engage in violent, hateful rhetoric on facebook, illustrating the curation of a culture of violence. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emilyhoerner/police-facebook-racist-violent-posts-comments-philadelphia\">luckily for us, it was tracked and collated</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xwvv3a/shot-by-cops\">police shoot people twice as often as previously thought.</a> Keep in mind that this was self-reported, so we have no way of knowing if these numbers speak to the actual number of shootings in the US. Many of these people are completely unarmed. Police kill far, <em>far</em> more people than terrorists in the US.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/how-dangerous-is-it-to-be-a-cop-heres-what-the-data-says-c07f6a58d8fc/\">Being a taxi driver is literally more dangerous than being a cop.</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/11/officers-firefighters-suicides-study/503735002/\">cops are more of a danger to themselves than anyone else is to them</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/\">they&#39;ve <em>admitted to</em> stealing as much -or recently <em>more</em>- than burglars through &quot;asset forfeiture,&quot; and the rate of their thefts has been climbing yearly.</a> Keep in mind, these numbers only articulate what&#39;s been reported. It&#39;s probable that they&#39;ve stolen far more than just this.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/this-teenager-accused-two-on-duty-cops-of-rape-she-had-no\">police are literally allowed to rape people on the job in 35 states,</a> as they have the power to determine whether or not you consented to sex with them while in their custody.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/media-must-report-police-violence-towards-disabled-people\">up to 50% of the people police murder are disabled</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETf7NJOMS6Y\">the police are being trained to kill as if they&#39;re an occupying army and we&#39;re an insurgency.</a> this is an inevitability, as the military-industrial complex needs to keep expanding into new markets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Eugenics was still alive and well in the prison-industrial complex up until very recently, and could very well be continuing for all we know, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/california-female-prisoner-sterilization\">it was forcibly sterilizing inmates as late as 2010.</a> I honestly don&#39;t see a reason to believe it&#39;s stopped. </p></li>\n<li><p>the police, as an institution, are so completely steeped in violence, that <a href=\"http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp\">up to 40% of them commit acts of domestic violence and abuse</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder\">you can&#39;t even really defend yourself from a cop, and if a cop <em>murders</em> you for no reason, he&#39;s almost certainly going to get away with it</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Once you&#39;re in jail, be prepared to sit there for weeks -or months or <em>years</em>. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/innocent-man-pleaded-guilty-drug-charge-get-out-jail-it-n1067321\">It&#39;s so bad that people constantly plead guilty just so they can get out.</a> It&#39;s so bad and so common, in fact, that <a href=\"https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations%20in%202018.pdf\">over a third of all exonerations come after an individual has pleaded guilty.</a> So much for the right to a speedy trial, huh?</p></li>\n<li><p>And getting arrested is easy. Tens of thousands of people yearly thanks to lowest bidder garbage that police departments use in order to test for illicit substances. Field drug tests are about as reliable as lie detector tests or horoscopes. They just don&#39;t fucking work. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/common-roadside-drug-test-routinely-produces-false-positives\">They just don&#39;t.</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Think you&#39;re safe if you just follow directions? <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/graphic-video-shows-police-killing-of-unarmed-man-in-arizona.html\">Yeah, no.</a> And if they don&#39;t just outright kill you, they could make their instructions <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OflGwyWcft8\">so arcane and hard to follow</a> that they&#39;ll kill you for not following them, and they&#39;ll usually get away with it. He got away with it, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/arizona-police-shooting-killed-man-crawling-floor-killed-a8100326.html\">by the way.</a> Surprise!</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/02/26/list-of-thousands-of-criminal.html\">They&#39;ll prosecute you for even <em>knowing about</em> crimes cops have committed.</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie\">Police exist to control and terrorize us,</a> not serve and protect us. That&#39;s only their function if you happen to be rich and powerful.</p></li>\n<li><p>And we all know that cops love shooting our pets, but how many do they really slaughter? <a href=\"https://puppycidedb.com/\">This database has begun tracking animal killings by police.</a> It&#39;s not perfect, as it&#39;s going to miss a ton of them, but it&#39;s a start.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://libcom.org/history/origins-police-david-whitehouse\">the police as they are now haven&#39;t even existed for 200 years as an institution,</a> and the modern police force was founded to control crowds and catch slaves, <a href=\"https://libcom.org/history/stop-kidding-yourself-police-were-created-control-working-class-poor-people-sam-mitrani\">not to &quot;serve and protect&quot;</a> -- unless you mean serving and protecting what people call &quot;the 1%.&quot; They have a long history of controlling the working class by intimidating, harassing, assaulting, and even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes\">murdering strikers during labor disputes.</a> This isn&#39;t a bug; it&#39;s a feature.</p>\n\n<p>The police do not serve justice. The police serve the ruling classes, whether or not they themselves are aware of it. They make our communities far more dangerous places to live, but there are alternatives to the modern police state. <a href=\"https://libcom.org/files/AWorldWithoutPolice_BW.pdf\">There is</a> a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wko0OnpxDX0\">better way.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p>\n\n<p>(all links are to free versions of the texts found online - <a href=\"http://aworldwithoutpolice.org/study-guide/\">many curated from this source</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politicalresearch.org/2019/06/10/how-a-right-wing-network-mobilized-sheriffs-departments\">white nationalists court and infiltrate a significant number of Sheriff&#39;s departments nationwide</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aintwhereyafrom.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/burn-down-the-prison-race-property-and-the-ferguson-rebellion/\">an analysis of post-ferguson policing</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/why-police-arent-welcome-at-pride\">why police shouldn&#39;t be tolerated at Pride</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7664UVmyo\">Kropotkin and a quick history of policing</a></p>\n\n<p>Agee, Christopher L.

Keep in mind since all of these involve uploading to the web they will be connectivity/service dependent. If you consistently have bad connectivity /u/cj2211 suggests this  [SanDisk flashdrive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBU22/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_CyV1Eb7YD04QK) that you can plug into your iPhone and automatically backup pictures and videos, Just to have another physical backup.\n\nI personally use iCloud since I have an iPhone, which does this automatically once set up. /u/marty_byrd_ pointed out that Google Photos does it automatically as well.\n\nWhen using the cloud for uploads my personal plug is take short bursts of video so that they start uploading as you go if you think you are going to have your phone smashed or something to that effect, you will have to stitch together the smaller videos at a later point in time. If you don't think your phone will get taken, you can take a large video and let it go through the process of uploading to the cloud, but this could take time.\n\nAnother low tech savy solution is to do a Facebook Livestream (or Instagram or Snapchat) per /u/CounterclockwiseFart. A Reddit livestream (via Rpan) is a less tech savy suggestion by /u/beachdude420. Another streaming platform suggested by /u/Ruthalas is [Periscope.](https://www.periscope.tv/) Per /u/FlatRateForms Dropbox also can be setup to automatically upload photos/videos even without wifi (but this will make it reliant on your service connectivity).\n\nA number of users have suggested [ACLU's apps](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct) for recording police and uploading them to their servers. Be forewarned that only certain states are covered and that some of the reviews for these apps aren't the greatest, I have no experience with them. Also worth noting each app is designed specifically to one state, so there will be variance between them. The common trend is that you record the interaction and it is then sent directly to ACLU's database. You then have to retrieve it from them.\n\nFinally for a non-tech savy iOS plug, you can use the iOS 12 shortcut feature and make one [specific to police interactions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/10/04/siri-shortcut-can-discreetly-record-cops-during-traffic-stops/1509065002/).  [u/RobertAPetersen](https://www.reddit.com/user/RobertAPetersen/) crafted this shortcut [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9huqiw/getting_pulled_over_by_police/) and I have never personally used it but just went through installing it to figure out how it works. The link to the shortcut follows, but you must open it in Safari: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/84ad422bdfaa45a695422cf6aab41b7f](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/84ad422bdfaa45a695422cf6aab41b7f)\n\nIn order to actually install it on your phone you need to first add shortcuts to your phone. Next, so you can mess with security settings, run any other normal shortcut from the shortcut app. Once you have done that, navigate to your settings, click shortcuts, then go down and 'allow untrusted shortcuts.' This will allow you to open the provided link in Safari and add it to your phone. Conversely you can follow the philosophy in u/RobertAPeterson's post and craft your own script.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for all the gilding, I hope this knowledge can be spread and help people out.",

The link to the shortcut follows, but you must open it in Safari: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/84ad422bdfaa45a695422cf6aab41b7f\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/84ad422bdfaa45a695422cf6aab41b7f</a></p>\n\n<p>In order to actually install it on your phone you need to first add shortcuts to your phone. Next, so you can mess with security settings, run any other normal shortcut from the shortcut app. Once you have done that, navigate to your settings, click shortcuts, then go down and &#39;allow untrusted shortcuts.&#39; This will allow you to open the provided link in Safari and add it to your phone. Conversely you can follow the philosophy in <a href=\"/u/RobertAPeterson\">u/RobertAPeterson</a>&#39;s post and craft your own script.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all the gilding, I hope this knowledge can be spread and help people out.</p>\n</div>",
