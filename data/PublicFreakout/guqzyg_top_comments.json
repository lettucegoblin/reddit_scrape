I\u2019m trying to think, maybe it\u2019s as insurance to not get prosecuted. The officer is now trying to get the guy to hold his stick so it holds up in court and he doesn\u2019t get fired. Maybe you\u2019ll be seeing this allot more not that police are going to have to make sure they don\u2019t up in jail they\u2019ll probably be trying to plant more drugs on you, getting you to hold weapons or making you seem like you\u2019re going for their taser.\nJust something to think about how the future might turn out if laws are putting police in the same situation as the offender. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding no stick\u201d\n\nDrops stick\n\nPuts mans hand on stick\n\nLooks up at lady filming\n\nMan grabs stick as officer lifts it from under his arm \n\nOfficer puts stick down now being held and punches fingers. Stands up with stick like it\u2019s got evidence on it.\n\nI mean ... looks like Hong Kong, police frame a guy with a stick and finger prints.",

Watch 0:08-0:10 carefully and repeatedly.\n\nThe detainee's entire body moves at the exact moment when his hand moves to the stick. His hips and shoulders square up, and his legs rotate from a fetal position to a balanced Y shape. These motions are exactly what you do if you are trying to get up. \n\nThe cop's own position is also wrong at that moment. His right arm is entirely extended and he's leaning over while on his feet. This is not how you generate power. To force the detainee's body to rotate and square up like it does, the cop would have to apply much more force than that stance would allow. He'd likely have to put his weight into it. In other words, he'd have to get down to his knees and lean in (which he does a few moments later, most likely in reaction to the detainee's escape attempt).\n\nNow, do I think the stick might have been bait? Maybe, although it's also possible the cop was just stupid. But, to me, the cop did not appear to put the man's hand on the stick. Rather, the detainee himself grabbed the stick.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Let me explain why some people (including myself) read this differently.</p>\n\n<p>I watch this video and see the detainee moving his own hand to the stick while he tries to escape. Watch 0:08-0:10 carefully and repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p>The detainee&#39;s entire body moves at the exact moment when his hand moves to the stick. His hips and shoulders square up, and his legs rotate from a fetal position to a balanced Y shape. These motions are exactly what you do if you are trying to get up. </p>\n\n<p>The cop&#39;s own position is also wrong at that moment. His right arm is entirely extended and he&#39;s leaning over while on his feet. This is not how you generate power. To force the detainee&#39;s body to rotate and square up like it does, the cop would have to apply much more force than that stance would allow. He&#39;d likely have to put his weight into it. In other words, he&#39;d have to get down to his knees and lean in (which he does a few moments later, most likely in reaction to the detainee&#39;s escape attempt).</p>\n\n<p>Now, do I think the stick might have been bait? Maybe, although it&#39;s also possible the cop was just stupid. But, to me, the cop did not appear to put the man&#39;s hand on the stick. Rather, the detainee himself grabbed the stick.</p>\n</div>",

If you look at the virginia protest, there was no damage to public or private property. that was a clean example of what a protest should be, even with thousands of armed individuals that mainstream media paints as &quot;violent&quot; for even owning guns. I thinks what happened to Floyd was horrific, and he deserves justice, but how is burning cities and small businesses to the ground justice? If someone destroys property all over a major city then gets arrested why should the 2A groups step in? if you believe in the rioting and you think its okay to set businesses on fire, then you are a terrible human being just like the ones that killed floyd.</p>\n</div>",
