And this is only the _content_ of the writing.\n\nOn top of the _content_, there is also the _craft_, the way the story is communicated through words printed on the page. One can have the most compelling story ever conceptually speaking, but their writing might be mediocre at best and may never feel sufficient to communicate how compelling the story might really be. Likewise, one can have an excellent command of craft, but not be very successful at using it to weave a compelling and engaging story.\n\nFor a number of writers, it is a lot of work and it is difficult because of not just developing the story but also crafting it into prose. In that regard, Kurt Vonnegut's notion that good writers don't enjoy the writing process is because good writers recognize how difficult and time consuming and painful it can be. It is the idea of writing a few paragraphs over the span of a few hours and then deleting it all because it's not good enough.\n\nI'm not at all saying that I'm a good writer at all, but having completed so many NaNoWriMos and having to prepare so much work for writing workshops, I can empathize with the idea that writing to a hypothetical, theoretical self-standard is _hard_, and it is understandable to constantly feel the pressure of \"this is not good enough\", even if to the casual reader/audience, it is more than merely remarkable.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me that Martin takes a lot of time because of these reasons. It's not just that it is a long story, and that he has written himself into situations that take effort to get out of, but also crafting each PoV chapter such that it falls in line with the PoV character's general thought process and word choice, and picking out details they would likely notice, and then doing it for all PoV characters in a single book? \n\nA hypothetical situation here would be having Sansa and Joffrey view the same dress differently, clouded by their own character backgrounds, and communicating these differences by showing how they process it.

Writing *is* a job. Every day, you've gotta put your ass in that chair and write. Clock in, clock out. It's not a fun hobby. Your husband will think it is, you sitting there writing dumb romance/sci-fi/fantasy novels, but it isn't. It's something you do to earn a living wage because it's better than working in retail or whatever god awful day job you've got going. It *can* be fun and enjoyable and fulfilling, but those are side quests. \n\nAnother thing about the job of being an author is that there are way more duties than just writing and editing. You've got marketing, promotions, email campaigns, sales that need to line up with announcements, advertising, etc.  You also have to research your market, and that means reading a fuck-ton of trending books in your genre. You, sir or madam, are no Stephen King. People aren't just going to buy your weird biographical urban fantasy erotic space opera just because you wrote it. Frankly, less than half my time as an author is actually spent writing. Most of that time goes into finding out *what* to write, and it's not simple as 'I like this idea!' \n\nYou like that idea. What does the market like? You go and read for a couple weeks, try to find out what is clicking with the market. Then you find a way to fashion that idea you like into a marketable conception. Then you write the thing. Then you edit the thing. Then you set up weeks and weeks of social media advertising, scheduled promotions, teasers, reveals, build your hype. Then you release it. And then you start all over again, only now, you have to keep pushing your entire back catalog, too, which means setting up more stuff for a book you finished 3 years ago. \n\nAnd you're not going to make a living off a novel a year. You're not GRRM. Most authors I know publish 5-12 novels per year. That's a lot of writing. So when I say less than half my time is spent writing (I publish 6 per year), you'll get the gravity of that statement. \n\nTL;DR - Contemporary authorship is not the romanticized notion many people see it as.",

It&#39;s something you do to earn a living wage because it&#39;s better than working in retail or whatever god awful day job you&#39;ve got going. It <em>can</em> be fun and enjoyable and fulfilling, but those are side quests. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing about the job of being an author is that there are way more duties than just writing and editing. You&#39;ve got marketing, promotions, email campaigns, sales that need to line up with announcements, advertising, etc.  You also have to research your market, and that means reading a fuck-ton of trending books in your genre. You, sir or madam, are no Stephen King. People aren&#39;t just going to buy your weird biographical urban fantasy erotic space opera just because you wrote it. Frankly, less than half my time as an author is actually spent writing. Most of that time goes into finding out <em>what</em> to write, and it&#39;s not simple as &#39;I like this idea!&#39; </p>\n\n<p>You like that idea. What does the market like? You go and read for a couple weeks, try to find out what is clicking with the market. Then you find a way to fashion that idea you like into a marketable conception. Then you write the thing. Then you edit the thing. Then you set up weeks and weeks of social media advertising, scheduled promotions, teasers, reveals, build your hype. Then you release it. And then you start all over again, only now, you have to keep pushing your entire back catalog, too, which means setting up more stuff for a book you finished 3 years ago. </p>\n\n<p>And you&#39;re not going to make a living off a novel a year. You&#39;re not GRRM. Most authors I know publish 5-12 novels per year. That&#39;s a lot of writing. So when I say less than half my time is spent writing (I publish 6 per year), you&#39;ll get the gravity of that statement. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - Contemporary authorship is not the romanticized notion many people see it as.</p>\n</div>",

I was wandering around the basement of one of the hotels, looking for weird stuff to get into when I notice a number of people hanging out in the panel room for the Wheel of Time series. There wasn't supposed to be any programming this late, so I catch a guy dressed as a wizard leaving the room to ask what's up.\n\n\"Oh, we're just hanging out and playing Magic with Brandon Sanderson.\"\n\nFull stop.\n\nNow The Wheel of Time is possibly the seminal fantasy series of my childhood and at the time I had just finished Sanderson's entries into the series. While the loss of Jordan (whom I had also bumped into under weird circumstances at DragonCon years before) hurt a lot, I was very pleased with how Sanderson was able to finish the series.
