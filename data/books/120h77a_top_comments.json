According to the New York Times, it has been pulled from library shelves in dozens of school districts around the country.\n\n> One of the school districts that came under pressure to remove the book was Community High School District 99, in Downers Grove, in Stava-Murray\u2019s district.

You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\u2019t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don\u2019t want to \u2018go out of your way to make trouble.\u2019 Why not?\u2014Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, \u2018everyone\u2019 is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \u2018It\u2019s not so bad\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re seeing things\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re an alarmist.\u2019\n\n\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can\u2019t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don\u2019t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n\n\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to\u2014to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\n\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\n\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u2018Jewish swine,\u2019 collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n\u200b\n\nCopyright notice: Excerpt from pages 166-73 of They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45 by Milton Mayer",
