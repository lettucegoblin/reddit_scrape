When we asked them how they separated they said by grade level. I told them I had a 98 in math. Did everyone in A and B have 99s and 100s? Teacher looked at me straight in the face and said yes.  \n\nFast forward a year to 8th grade, A and B group took pre algebra while the rest of us took more remedial math type of course. We all had mixed group home room, so during home room, two of the A group asked me for help with pre algebra. I never saw it but I'd read the couple pages then read the examples they wrote down then would show them. At the end of the year, the math teacher had to sign off on what math we went into. If you done pre algebra she'd sign you up for algebra and you'd be able to complete college course math in high school. If not, you were put into another remedial math, then 10th grade pre algebra (you read that right), then 11th algebra 1, 12th algebra 2.  \n\nI went up to the teacher at the end to get my paper signed for what class she was going to put me in. She looked at me and looked kinda troubled then even though I saw her use the top stamp on everyone in my group C (for remedial math in high school) she looked at me and asked, \"I feel like I've seen your handwriting alot this semester. Do you know what I mean?\" I'd do an example or two while teaching two A group students and they never erased.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This isn&#39;t new. In 7th grade they started separating us into groups A B C D and E. A and B were all the rich kids. The other three groups were not rich. When we asked them how they separated they said by grade level. I told them I had a 98 in math. Did everyone in A and B have 99s and 100s? Teacher looked at me straight in the face and said yes.  </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a year to 8th grade, A and B group took pre algebra while the rest of us took more remedial math type of course. We all had mixed group home room, so during home room, two of the A group asked me for help with pre algebra. I never saw it but I&#39;d read the couple pages then read the examples they wrote down then would show them. At the end of the year, the math teacher had to sign off on what math we went into. If you done pre algebra she&#39;d sign you up for algebra and you&#39;d be able to complete college course math in high school. If not, you were put into another remedial math, then 10th grade pre algebra (you read that right), then 11th algebra 1, 12th algebra 2.  </p>\n\n<p>I went up to the teacher at the end to get my paper signed for what class she was going to put me in. She looked at me and looked kinda troubled then even though I saw her use the top stamp on everyone in my group C (for remedial math in high school) she looked at me and asked, &quot;I feel like I&#39;ve seen your handwriting alot this semester. Do you know what I mean?&quot; I&#39;d do an example or two while teaching two A group students and they never erased. I hesitated and said, &quot;yeah&quot; and she frowned and looked down and stamped me in for algebra 1 saying &quot;I believe you can do it.&quot; which put me on a college pathway I may not have otherwise pursued.  </p>\n\n<p>Sorting by class just showed me that those who have, will keep, and those who don&#39;t, will struggle.

They&#39;ve also fucked over school leavers, GCSEs were butchered by a socioeconomic bias that was <em>by design</em> included into the predictive grade adjustments, meaning students from poorer backgrounds were immediately given a blanket reduction in grades compared to students from more affluent areas. Student who have taken vocational course (BTEC), usually from poorer backgrounds still haven&#39;t been given their grades because the government had fucked them up too and are now frantically back-tracking. This is beyond abysmal - we can&#39;t take four more years of this government.</p>\n</div>",

Seeing your description of the grade-level they had you guys aiming for made me a bit emotional about my own progress. When i started 11th grade i basically didn't understand any part of math at all. I was completely clueless. I was put into remedial math for the first time that year, with Mr. Panda. He showed me so much patience, showed me how to persevere harder than i ever thought i could, and i learned how love both math and philosophy with him. So in your school they assigned 10th grade pre algebra because of being in class c, but i didn't even master it until 11th grade. And then with Mr. Panda's encouragement and faith in me, i took geometry that same year and got an A. I considered going for pre-ap algebra 2 the next year, which is basically precal. I was about to do it but i wanted his opinion first -and he said he believed in me. He believed that i could do it on my own. He could have me near him while i worked (i got a lot of work done in his after-school tutorial sessions because my home environment was too distracting) but he said he really wanted me to push myself and try to learn on my own before i could try coming to him for help. I only asked him for help once more after that, and it was so bittersweet. I learned the rest on my own. One of my most cherished memories in life is overhearing him telling another math teacher how proud of me he was\n\nI'm so glad you had a teacher who noticed your abilities and potential, and gave you a chance when the system would have continued to fail you",

Who is #1, #2...\n\nThe CAGs were high. This is to be expected; the guidance said to put what the student could achieve \"on their best day\". The government wanted to normalise the results so there wasn't a spike in grades.\n\nFor larger cohorts (class size >15, in the UK I want to say the average class size is 25+) the CAGs were more or less ignored. Instead, they averaged the last 3 years of results to produce a distribution curve and assigned people grades based on rank. If nobody got an A last year, you might be blocked from getting one. You had students predicted an A in their CAG getting assigned a D. Students predicted a C getting a U (ungraded, the only way to actually fail an exam, though only C and above is considered a \"proper\" pass). Let me repeat that; *students were told they'd failed an exam they hadn't even sat*.\n\nSmaller classes (often private or grammar schools) were not normalised as much.\n\nThey had run this algorithm using previous data to see how accurate it was. They found that it was 60% accurate, dropping to 40% in some subjects. ***But***, for previous years they didn't have teacher rankings available, so they had to use *actual* rankings. This means that the final run of the algorithm would be less accurate when using teacher rankings because those rankings can't be expected to be perfect.\n\nThe average grade went up by more than usual this year, but the average means fuck all when it's your grades that get knocked down by an algorithm.\n\n----\n\nTo add on; in recent years the Tories have made ideological changes to the structure of A level assessments. It used to be a mix of coursework and exams, and the exams would usually be split over 4 exam periods (January and Summer, over 2 years). If you quit after the first year, you'd still walk away with a (lesser) qualification. Under this system, most students would have had half to three quarters of their grades by the time COVID hit, giving more concrete data to base predictions on (hell, they could have just offered them their average grade so far). \n\nBut it was changed by the Tories to strip out as much coursework as possible, and to place all the exams into one exam period at the end of the two years. This means that for most students they had 0 officially graded work.\n\nThe conservatives made the system fragile, and the single point of failure went and failed.\n\n---\n\nThe aftermath:\n\nUniversity offers in the UK go through a system called UCAS. You can apply to 5 universities. Each of those may or may not give you a conditional offer; achieve the grades in the offer, and you get in. You can pick a primary and \"backup\" offer to accept. On results day, you'll get an email saying \"congrats, you got in\", often before you actually get your results.\n\nThe problem is that the universities were given no real warning that this clusterfuck was incoming. They accepted a bunch of people based on their algorithm grades, and now have to accept or reject the people who are achieving their offers via non-algorithm grades (because they only have so much actual, physical room for students).\n\nBonus points; there's a system called \"clearing\" where you can apply for uni if you didn't achieve the grades you needed. All the universities with spare places list them out and it's a mad dash to get what you can. The government U-turn happened after clearing, so loads of students have had the right run around, being rejected, searching for another uni, before asking the original uni if they can get in with their new grades.\n\nNobody knows what the fuck is going on.",
