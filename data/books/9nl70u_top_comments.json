There are so many things that could be on the paper and many synthetic drugs don&#39;t have any sort of test on them.  Even if it&#39;s something testable, you have to contend with any latent chemicals that are in the original paper screwing up the test.  You can&#39;t test the whole paper, so they might put the drug on a different part than the one you test.  I&#39;m all for prison reform but what you&#39;re asking here really isn&#39;t feasible.  I think the photo-copying method is actually a pretty good compromise, especially if the inmate is present to &quot;sign off&quot; on the copy.</p>\n</div>",
