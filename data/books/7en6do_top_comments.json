My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.\n\nThe nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.

In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.\n\nThis Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.\n\nAnd with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the \"face\" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.\n\nThe repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.\n\nHowever in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.\n\nIf the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.\n\nI implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values.",

I have always been proud to be an American citizen, with our flaws and our strengths. This last year has been a shameful nightmare for the American people. The people in power and influence aren't even trying to be discreet with their selfish ambitions, and its the voters and citizens who will suffer for the benefit of someone else.\n\nNet Neutrality is not some evil scheme by the Democrats; Obama is not some sort of supervillain whose wake of terror and malice has to be repealed and cleaned up. The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.\n\nRepealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully. These bullies want more control, more money, and they don't care who they have to harm to get it. The fact that multiple, countless fake identities were made to spread false information to promote the repealing of Net Neutrality should indicate that this is an evil, amoral and twisted idea that even its promoters are aware of. If this was good for the the people of this country at all, there would be actual support of it.\n\nI am so ashamed to have to live in a country where the people are going unheard, and blatantly self-serving laws are being passed. Net Neutrality is one idea that was already voted against, and here we are again, begging and pleading for some rational thought and compassion to find the hearts of the people that determine the fate of this country that we all live in.\n\nAre we citizens of this country, or are we marks for companies to take for all we have? Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.\n\nIf this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change \u201cWe the People\u201d to \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d\n\nFor the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason.

If it did, they would have done it before 2015, and they didn't.\n\n>Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today\n\nNet neutrality is not a \"principle\", it's a set of unnecessary regulations. It was created in 2015...the internet was around for decades beforehand, so it's literally impossible for it to have \"shaped the internet\". It doesn't even exist outside the USA (news flash, the internet exists outside the USA).\n\n>It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nMUH BIG INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS!!! Net neutrality prevents none of these things and there is no evidence supporting this claim. There is however ample evidence of liberal websites censorship of dissenters (like being banned for understanding the truth about NN).\n\n>the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money.\n\nNo, they have been spending money to kill net neutrality because regulations kill business.\n\n\n>Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC,\n>Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public.\n\nSo this entire idiotic movement is based on a conspiracy theory.\n\n\n>People from across the political spectrum are outraged, \n\nJust the ignorant ones.\n\n\n\n\nMost arguments for NN and against its repeal are not evidence-based, but based on made up fearmongering scenarios that have never happened. Here I address some of the main talking points.\n\n>Net Neutrality was the unspoken but observed rules of the road in times past.\n\nNo it wasn't. It didn't exist before 2015. Even if it was the \"unspoken rules\", when were these \"unspoken rules\" broken, so that they suddenly needed to be codified into regulations in 2015?\n\nWhat you're saying doesn't even make sense. It's like saying Affirmative Action was the \"unspoken rule\" before 1961, and Kennedy just decided to make it a law for no reason. Labor laws were \"unspoken rules\" before being enacted! \n\nLaws and regulations are (and should be) made in response to things, not \"just because\". Affirmative action was implemented **in response** to racial discrimination. Labor laws were put into place **in response** to unfair employer practices. Net Neutrality was implemented for some reason **just because** it was an \"unspoken rule\" that was never broken? Please.\n\n>As bigger and bigger monopolies came to be ISPS (cable companies) they started to experiment monetizing the traffic\n\nNo they didn't.\n\n>Sure they can; look at neflix and Comcast. They basiclly proved it. \n\nNo they didn't.\n\n>Title 2 is there to stop providers from extorting companies and snuffing out small players. \n\nNo it's not. Title 2 is an anti-discrimination clause specifically designed to prevent racial discrimination by phone carriers (it was written in 1934).\n\nTitle II: **SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES. (a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.**\n\nTaken in context, Title II is 100% about racism and preventing phone companies from discriminating against black people. Simple. It's irrelevant in 2017 and there is no evidence it's needed. It should be easy to gather such evidence, there was no net neutrality before 2015. So show me this time when ISP's were unscrupulously charging fees for some services and not for others...the so called justification for Title II in 2017...i'm waiting.\n\n>Service providers would love to do it like mobile with metered Internet and data caps on customers,\n\nThey already do that. Net Neutrality doesn't prevent ISP's from metering data or implementing data caps across all users. Comcast already has a 1TB data cap.\n\n>then extort money from Internet sites at the same time.\n\nProve it.\n\n>This is about monopolies extending their physical access into a tax on our culture and speech. They must be regulated because they will try to tax every packet then turn that power into propaganda to keep the sheep in line.\n\nProve it.\n\n\nBy definition (for the sheep) -\n\nNet Neutrality = regulations\n\nRemoving regulations = opening internet\n\nPlacing regulations = restricting internet\n\nPretty simple. Unless you are the former FCC chair, then NET NEUTRALITY IS NOT REGULATIONS, ITS LIKE THE FIRST AMENDMENT!!

Competition is good for consumers, but bad for business (them). There are so few carriers (there are lots of piggy-backs that don't own anything) that they all just circle jerk each other. No new companies can be created because it is too difficult to enter the market (e.g., infrastructure costs, maybe some policy/politicians that have their hands in the ISP pocket making it harder too). It takes a company like Google to push something like google fiber, and I'm sure they'll tell you that its an uphill battle even for them.   \nWhile not technically a 'monopoly'. It's pretty darn close. The last thing they need is a way to make more money off consumers (or businesses)   \nIf I knew that new ISPs could come in and steal business away if the current ones pushed things too far, I wouldn't be worried. That's a major part of the problem though. You don't get new carriers. There is no competition. Net Neutrality is one of the only things holding back what is essentially a runaway freight train.   \nThinking about that now, that's probably why they're doing this.
