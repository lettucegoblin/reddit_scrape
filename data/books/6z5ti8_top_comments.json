As the boys start to panic, Beverly comes up with the idea of having sex with the others in order to calm them down, as a result the other Losers take turns having sex with her. Because King didn&#39;t wish this to be viewed as a lewd scene, the narrative explicitly states that the act of intimacy with each of the boys&#39; helps to further strengthen their friendship; and Beverly only experiences orgasm while having intercourse with Bill Denbrough and Ben Hanscom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Id say Stephen King truly captured the mind of 14-year-olds prioritizing sex over anything else - in this case being lost in the domain of a supernatural being hell-bent on torturing and eating them. However, these kids are supposedly 11 years old. This is bringing me back to Aldous Huxley&#39;s Brave New World more than anything.</p>\n</div>",

To become more then just themselves together facing this. To escape the idea to fear with someone that is its direct counterpart: ecstasy.

After each one has their turn, or after they trained Bevvie, they looked at her and said I love you Beverly. Because it was true and it was something that took them away from the fear of that moment. Maybe other things could have been written to convey the same idea, but this moment is something people talk about because sex is powerful and ultimately still very unknown to a lot of us. We need it, desire it, do our best to have it, but for a lot of us (maybe just me) we just have sex for ourselves to feel good. But to feel love and to be with someone you love in that way it's an entire different idea/feeling. It's powerful and should always make us feel out of place because whether we're children or adults we should all be so lucky to achieve the love those group of losers had for one another. I don't think about the sex so much as the act of innocent love being shown for one another. It is super weird and jolting but again we're talking about it and it's impactful.

We talked about it for a while.\n\nIt definitely stands out in his work how often it pops up and how oddly he writes about it. That being said, I've never been entirely convinced it's unjustified.

It's almost always something half wanted and half disdained. Its the meeting between human and animal. There's also a lot of use of sex as or for power, both wielding and taking, and not necessarily in an abusive sense. I think King just recognizes and focuses on the power it has. I think we shy from it because the way he writes is is almost always uncomfortable. It's not fun to read and it's not all lust, love, and satisfaction. But like I said, I'm still not convinced it's out of place in his work, it's just a jarring interpretation to what we expect. \nBut I'm no expert.

But that's just what I think, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, folks.\n\nHere is the part of the book that everyone is talking about for anyone interested in having a little more context:\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n**Chapter 22 The Ritual of Ch\u00fcd / Part 12: Love and Desire / August 10th, 1958**\n\nPages 1098 - 1104\n\nHer thoughts broke off as she realized that Eddie comes to her first, because he is the most frightened. He comes to her not as her friend of that summer, or as her brief lover now, but the way he would have come to his mother only three or four years ago, to be comforted; he doesn't draw back from her smooth nakedness and at first she doubts if he even feels it. He is trembling, and although she holds him the darkness is so perfect that even this close she cannot see him; except for the rough cast he might as well be a phantom.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asks her.\n\n\"You have to put your thing in me,\" she says.\n\nHe tries to pull back but she holds him and he subsides against her. She has heard someone-Ben, she thinks-draw in his breath.\n\n\"Bevvie, I can't do that. I don't know how-\"\n\n\"I think it's easy. But you'll have to get undressed.\" She thinks about the intricacies of managing cast and shirt, first somehow separating and then rejoining them, and amends, \"Your pants, anyway.\"\n\n\"No, I can't!\" But she thinks part of him can, and wants to, because his trembling has stopped and she feels something small and hard which presses against the right side of her belly.\n\n\"You can,\" she says, and pulls him down. The surface beneath her bare back and legs is firm, clayey, dry. The distant thunder of the water is drowsy, soothing. She reaches for him. There's a moment when her father's face intervenes, harsh and forbidding\n\n(I want to see if you're intact)\n\nand then she closes her arms around Eddie's neck, her smooth cheek against his smooth cheek, and as he tentatively touches her small breasts she sighs and thinks for the first time \"This is Eddie\" and she remembers a day in July-could it only have been last month?-when no one else turned up in the Barrens but Eddie, and he had a whole bunch of Little Lulu comic books and they read together for most of the afternoon, Little Lulu looking for beebleberries and getting in all sorts of crazy situations, Witch Hazel, all of those guys. It had been fun.\n\nShe thinks of birds; in particular of the grackles and starlings and crows that come back in the spring, and her hands go to his belt and loosen it, and he says again that he can't do that; she tells him that he can, she knows he can, and what she feels is not shame or fear now but a kind of triumph.\n\n\"Where?\" he says, and that hard thing pushes urgently against her inner high.\n\n\"Here,\" she says.\n\n\"Bevvie, I'll fall on you!\" he says, and she hears his breath start to whistle painfully.\n\n\"I think that's sort of the idea,\" she tells him and holds him gently and guides him. He pushes forward too fast and there is pain.\n\nSsssss!-she draws her breath in, her teeth biting at her lower lip and thinks of the birds again, the spring birds, lining the roofpeaks of houses, taking wing all at once under low March clouds.\n\n\"Beverly?\" he says uncertainly. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Go slower,\" she says. \"It'll be easier for you to breathe.\" He does move more slowly, and after awhile his breathing speeds up but she understands this is not because there is anything wrong with him.\n\nThe pain fades. Suddenly he moves more quickly, then stops, stiffens, and makes a sound-some sound. She senses that this is something for him, something extraordinarily, special, something like... like flying. She feels powerful: she feels a sense of triumph rise up strongly within her. Is this what her father was afraid of? Well he might be! There was power in this act, all right, a chain-breaking power that was blood-deep. She feels no physical pleasure, but there is a kind of mental ecstasy in it for her. She senses the closeness. He puts his face against her neck and she holds him. He's  crying. She holds him. And feels the part of him that made a connection between them begin to fade. It is not leaving her, exactly; it is simply fading, becominging less.\n\nWhen his weight shifts away she sits up and touches his face in the darkness.\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"Did I what?\"\n\n\"Whatever it is. I don't know, exactly.\"\n\nHe shakes his head-she feels it with her hand against his cheek.\n\n\"I don't think it was exactly like... you know, like the big boys say. But it was... it was really something.\" He speaks low so the others boys don't hear. \"I love you, Bevvie.\"\n\nHer consciousness breaks down a little there. She's quite sure there's more talk, some whispered, some loud, and can't remember what is said. It doesn't matter. Does she have to talk each of them into it all over again? Yes, probably. But it doesn't matter. They have to be talked into it, this essential human link between the world and the infinite, the only place where the bloodstream touches eternity. It doesn't matter. What matters is love and desire. Here in this dark is as good a place as any. Better than some, maybe.\n\nMike comes to her, then Richie, and the act is repeated. Now she feels some pleasure, dim heat in her childish unmatured sex, and she closes her eyes as Stan comes to her and she thinks of the birds, spring and the birds, and she sees them, again and again, all lighting at once, filling up the winter-naked trees, shockwave riders on the moving edge of nature's most violent season, she sees them take wing again and again, the flutter of their wings like the snap of many sheets on the line, and she thinks: A month from now every kid in Derry Park will have a kite, they'll run to keep the strings from getting tangled with each other. She thinks again: This is what flying is like.\n\nWith Stan as with the others, there is that rueful sense of fading, of leaving, with whatever they truly need from this act-some ultimate-close but as yet unfound.\n\n\"Did you?\" she asks again, and although she doesn't know exactly what \"it\" is, she knows that he hasn't...\n\n[Continued...](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6z5ti8/stephen_king_briefly_talks_about_the/dmsv7yv/)",
