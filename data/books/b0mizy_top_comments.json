I'm certain there are more publishers and distributors  more than willing to crank out this crap (we still have Chick Tracts) and those authors (to the best of my knowledge) haven't been prohibited from publishing. It can still be freely available, just not through this one particular outlet. Personally, I get upset that people think that Amazon is the government and that they are impinging on their right to free speech by not supporting their material. By doing this they themselves are trying to force their material on someone else; trying to deny Amazon's right to choose what they associate with. \nIf this were government action (though in the Anti-vax issue I think I'd agree that misinformation taken as fact is more harmful to society than not, with far reaching complications based on herd immunity. Won't go into it here) and it was a full scale \"you cannot publish or distribute this without criminal penalties\" I would whole-heartedly defend their right to publish their works. Since this isn't the case though, those who argue that it is a free speech issue haven't got a very sturdy platform in these cases. Amazon makes it easier to publish works and easier to distribute it to a vast majority of the world. Speech should be free.
