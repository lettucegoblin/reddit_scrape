It was just my childish brain making up some context about why mom wasn't home for most of the day. When my mom told her parents she was pregnant, my grandad just left, because he was divorced from my grandma, so he must've gone home, and my grandma, she just kept an uncomfortable silence until they were done with dinner... Fast forward to a few weeks next, in the city I grew up, in december, there would always be a christmas fair, and it's been sort of a huge thing lately, taking the main avenue of the city for this event, my grandma got some childish material, and when she arrived home, she asked my mom \"Pick a design for the baby\" she always tells me how of a relief this was, because she always kept thinking of \"She will make me get an abortion\". My mom started crying of happiness on my grandma's shoulder, and everything was sealed up, a great human bonding experience for her. I was the first newborn of them, so it was like, sort of a big deal being the first kid of three sons my grandma had, so yeah, win-win. I've asked my dad about what happened when he told my other grandma he made his girlfriend pregnant, and he never gives me an accurate response.\n\nNow, I'm looking back at the awesome childhood my parents were able to give me, even though the enviroment wasn't the best for a child to grow up, they did everything they could do to give me the best childhood, and I'm pretty grateful about that, now it's been 17 years, my parents got a divorce, and I have a 4 year old brother who's been in the middle of this struggle ever since he was just a helpless baby, I'm trying my best to give him a normal childhood, distracting him from everything that's wrong, just as my parents did... Ugh, this got pretty emotional x3\n\nWe would share hobbies, like playing smash bros every other weekend we get to see each other, talk about almost anything, and I hope he tells the same stories I tell about my parents, but having me included, that would make me a happy man\n\nTL;DR: I was born by accident, but given an awesome childhood, and I want to give an awesome childhood to my young brother, because our parents are divorced",

I&#39;m 35 this year and my partner and I are only thinking of starting for kids this year... the prospect of beind an &#39;old parent&#39; is terrifying.\nI am blessed that at 65 and 66 my folks are still full of adventure and drive. They sold up 10 years ago, bought a winnebago and have been travelling around the country working odd jobs ever since. They are currently caretakers of a island/airstrip - super remote and awesome. I think this helps me makes me feel a little invincible - I&#39;m never going to finish grow up, either!\n... and somewhat fittingly my parents&#39; names are Peter and Wendy - if you see them and their rig (&quot;Finding Neverland&quot; on the road, say hi!</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "My grandparents were still young when I was a kid, in their 50s. They were very active, played volleyball (my grandpa was awesome, I remember watching him spiking it in kids faces and diving around the court), started kickball games for the kids in the neighborhood, and chopped wood all summer for their wood burning stove. My grandpa was very smart: loved puzzles, worked for the CIA as a cryptographer, and was fluent in 4 languages. He was very extroverted and as a languages teacher, many people in the community loved him \n\nAt 17 I remember crying just thinking that some day they would be older and some day they'd die. I went away to the Army and had a son and returned about 5 years later. My grandparents still played volleyball but now they couldn't jump or dive. They sold their wood burning stove because they couldn't chop wood as much. Their gardens were a quarter of the size they used to be. My grandpa couldn't remember a lot of short term things and was having trouble with basic math. I had to explain things to the smartest man I've ever known. At least they were both still physically healthy. The doctor told my grandpa he had at least 20 years left.\n\nLater that year he caught a cold that lasted a few months. Finally he went to the Dr and they said he had pneumonia. After meds didn't work they said they'd have to drain his chest, it would take a day or two and he'd be out at the end of the weekend. 3 days in and fluid was still being drained. It was as if the fluid was building as fast as it was being drained. That's when he started seeing specialists. He was diagnosed with one thing after the other, cancer being the main suspect. Over the next few months he aged 20 years. His cheeks became sunken, he couldn't stay awake for more than an hour at a time and had to sleep sitting up and wake up every couple hours coughing. He was miserable. One time he asked me if he should pursue aggressive treatments that would delay the inevitable... It was a poignant moment having my hero ask *me* for my opinion.\n\nLess than a year after the doctor told him he had 20 years left, he had died from mesothelioma. I miss him so much. Part of me thinks it's a good scenario though. His mind was important to him and he wouldn't have wanted to slowly wither away. He had 80 great years and a shitty six months. One thing that kills me though is that when he had a cough he started sleeping in the guest room so my grandma could sleep. They never slept in the same bed again. Who would've thought?\n\nNow, almost 2 years later, my grandma has aged quite a bit. She moves slower, she's so lonely. She was independent to a fault and now she waits for me on Thursdays to take out her trash. She hints but won't ask for my help with things like putting on her sling after she slipped on ice at the bowling alley. She loved to sew but her eyes are so bad that she can't thread the needle anymore. I can't handle this again, it sucks.\n\nWhen I go to their house though it's the same house I grew up in (we lived next door when I was a kid). It's easy to remember waking up to the smell of eggs and coffee. When it's quiet I still hear the tick tock of the clock that I used to fall asleep to and wonder if maybe I fall asleep I'll wake up as 5 year old me again.\n\nTime is brutal.",
