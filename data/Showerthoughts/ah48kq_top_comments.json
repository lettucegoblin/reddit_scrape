        "body": "I was working as a delivery driver at my local pizza store back when i was a student. You know, a man needs money.\nOne time i was wearing my Aperture Science hoodie instead of work clothing. Got a delivery to the campus dorm. It was a cute girl, first semester, just recently moved in. She seemed to be pretty shy but after paying she complimented my hoody and told me she loves portal. \n\nMy dumbass brain, being in a rush, just came up with a \"thank you have a nice evening\" and i was on my way out before i realized my missed chance there.\n\nThank god i was already in my fifth semester and not a shy freshman anymore. As i reached the dorm lobby where the bell system is i rang up her room again.\nI told her im sorry to interrupt her meal but i feel like i made a mistake right there because i\u2018m in a hurry. I asked her if she would like to play some portal 2 after my shift ends. And fuck yeah she said yes.\n\nSo back in the store i tell my manager about it. That damn kickass bastard laughed at me and said \"what are you waiting for? check out for today!\" and so i did.\nWent home, took a shower, got dressed up with my second portal hoodie (white portal turret look) and made my way to her dorm. (btw my dorm was just across the campus, like 2mins away)\n\nWe played portal 2 for hours, talking the whole time. It gets late... 3am... we\u2018ve been playing for 5 hours. By this time we already felt so much sympathy for each other we jokingly called it our first date and set up a second one for the next day.\n\nWe started dating seriously, end up in a realtionship for the rest of my college time.

You know, a man needs money.\nOne time i was wearing my Aperture Science hoodie instead of work clothing. Got a delivery to the campus dorm. It was a cute girl, first semester, just recently moved in. She seemed to be pretty shy but after paying she complimented my hoody and told me she loves portal. </p>\n\n<p>My dumbass brain, being in a rush, just came up with a &quot;thank you have a nice evening&quot; and i was on my way out before i realized my missed chance there.</p>\n\n<p>Thank god i was already in my fifth semester and not a shy freshman anymore. As i reached the dorm lobby where the bell system is i rang up her room again.\nI told her im sorry to interrupt her meal but i feel like i made a mistake right there because i\u2018m in a hurry. I asked her if she would like to play some portal 2 after my shift ends. And fuck yeah she said yes.</p>\n\n<p>So back in the store i tell my manager about it. That damn kickass bastard laughed at me and said &quot;what are you waiting for? check out for today!&quot; and so i did.\nWent home, took a shower, got dressed up with my second portal hoodie (white portal turret look) and made my way to her dorm.

She was a bit surprised and said she feels so sad because she would have loved to have been invited. </p>\n\n<p>At that point I have never had someone tell me they were upset over anything I did before, not to mention I didn\u2019t understand why. I just stood there awkwardly, wishing that I had just asked her what the word meant. She then asked \u201cdo you secretly think I\u2019m annoying and you don\u2019t want to be around me?\u201d I just couldn\u2019t believe that we were having this conversation, because I didn\u2019t know what was going on and because she was so nice and amazing, I\u2019m not sure why she would even say that. After a really long silence, I ended up saying \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe\u201d. She gave me a hug and never spoke to me again. I asked my parents what party meant and I was so embarrassed to ever go and apologize or even admit to my parents why we stopped talking. </p>\n\n<p>That was the first time I ever hurt someone and I remember it so vividly like it happened yesterday. I don\u2019t think anything has ever made me feel as guilty since. </p>\n</div>",

I even dated a conventionally unattractive woman 14 years my senior whose company I enjoyed more than anyone I've ever met, and she never paid me a compliment on my appearance, ever. We dated for a year. \n\nEDIT: People are asking for a picture of me.
