I had a wakeup call that something in my life needed to change when one day I came home from work late. My Pup Willow was so happy to see me that she was running around the apartment. I had just sat in traffic for 3 hours with no A/C in the middle of August. All I wanted to do was come home, drink some whiskey, and forget about the hell that my life had become. \n\nThings hit a breaking point when Willow jumped on my bed. She knew she wasn't allowed on the bed, and was usually very good about it. Well I just got angrier and angrier and I started yelling at her to get off the fucking bed! She laid down and started rolling around on it instead. I was pissed! I stormed over there and grabbed her by the scruff of the neck and pulled quite a bit harder than I had intended to. Well Willow was a rescue and had been abused before. In the course of me trying to drag her off the bed, her feet got tangled up in the blankets. Well she panicked and gave me a nice hard bite that put two canine-sized holes through the webbing of my hand. I RECOILED AND CURSED, and she ran into the other room.\n\nWhile I found a towel to mop up my blood, it hit me exactly how terrified she must have been. I had NEVER treated her that way before, and the worst part was that I wasn't even mad at her to begin with. I was miserable...having just split up with my wife of 8 years, and I was taking it out on the dog? What kind of an asshole does that?!?! I spent the rest of the night crying and spoiling Willow every way I could think of. \n\nWhen I was forced to move a few months later, I couldn't find a good home for Willow, or a place where I could keep her; So we lived in my van for a month in December with a good friend of mine, until a house that was dog-friendly became available.\n\nBottom line, that dog really loved me, and saved me from the dark road of depression I was headed down.

It was easy to judge until I read an article that a single grown man in an Asian society may not have been touched (e.g. hugged) or shown affection in anyway in decades. It really blown my mind. </p>\n\n<p>I was once on a three day train ride and first thing I got off was to touch the friend I was meeting, it was super weird (I was just poking her on her forearm) but I felt the  need to connect physically, so I knew what the article was trying to say. </p>\n\n<p>From then on I reminded myself to be kinder to single men, especially those who are past 30 and have not dated before.</p>\n</div>",

Leading with your wrist, using your hips too much, even being too *into* dancing in any way...Straight men are supposed to look tough and unhappy when they dance and it's terribly sad.\n\nI recently taught myself to dance and I had to work through a lot of \"that's too gay\" voices in my head. I kept practicing though and now I dance about 4-6 hours every week in my living room. It's a constant joy. I've always had a deep love for music and now I have a way to express it. Also my butt's tighter than it's ever been for the past 15 years.\n\nFor anyone interested, here's some of my rules for dancing:\n\n1. Give yourself floor space. I can't imagine dancing in nightclub conditions. I need room, at least 4ft by 4ft. Once you teach yourself, you'll be able dance in a much smaller space but for now occupy that space! It's yours, so own it.\n\n2. Dance from your feet. It sounds obvious but I didn't get dancing until I started seriously moving my feet. From there I linked in my shoulders, hips and knees but just start with the feet.\n\n3. Wear socks (and dance on linoleum). If you're one of those weird American types who always wear shoes, you can wear footie stockings over your shoes but honestly just wear socks so you can rotate on the balls of your feet. (Also if you are dancing at a club, footie stockings over your shoes are the best!)\n\n4. Don't think. Yes, I was drunk the first time I really danced, but I've been drunk many times before and it never happened. I just didn't have it in me to care anymore. I didn't think about dancing; I just put myself into the music. It's like walking, or laughing. If you're thinking about it as you do it, it comes off super fucking weird.\n\n5. Practice. I got up the next day, stone cold sober, and danced for an hour to prove that I could (and to lock in some muscle memory). Then I practiced every night for a month. It's now part of my life. It's hard to believe it wasn't at one point.\n\nI think this will only work if you're the type to get goosebumps when you listen to songs you really love. There's a lot of people out there who are ultimately 'meh' when it comes to music, and they're going to be happy with shifting side to side because it's the sociable thing to do.\n\nFor everyone who has a deep and abiding love for music and doesn't dance, start dancing. If the music is in you, so is the dance.",

I was 14.\n\nWhen my mother let my dog run loose at night and he got hit by a car, I had to walk to where his body was on the road, wrap him in a sheet, and carry him back to the yard, and bury him. The dog was an 85 lb husky, and beautiful.\nI was 15. \n\nNow I am older, and married, and we have a beloved pit-mix that dotes on my children. He\u2019s 10 years old now, and I can see him declining. I\u2019m putting anti-arthritis supplements in his food, switching him to special kibble, and regularly take him to the vet to prolong his good years as much as I can.  But I know when it\u2019s time, it will be me and me alone in the Vet\u2019s office, holding my dog as he dies.

He was dumb as hell, and as scary as he was, he was such a chicken he was scared of his own shadow. But a scared dog is a dog which might attack somebody. My dad trained him and worked really hard on him so he won't be dangerous, and it was really hard. But he slowly became the most obedient and loving big doofus i've ever seen.\n\nI study on a university which is pretty close to my parents, so i often cone for the weekends. The three of us would go for long walks in the countryside, and the big doofus ran like it was the only thing he ever wanted. Like he waited for these walks all week. One such walk he started shaking, and my father quickly understood; he'd been poisoned.

Not let him run?\n\nWe got him to the vet as fast as we could, but it was too late. He died in my arms within 45m of him first shaking. He was less then two years old, with us for only around one year. This was about 6 months after the fifth one died from cancer. I've lost two amazing dogs in less than one year. That was devastating. My father still blames himself, thinking he should have trained it better to not eat random pieces of meat, i don't think it was remotely feasible.\n\nWe buried him the next day. Pretty quickly my father felt he works his heart too much (had a heart attack couple of years back), so he went back home to take a break while i continued. I've finished digging a huge hole for this giant bastard alone in the woods, and cried my heart out.\n\nWhen i was younger my father was the one burying them, the all-powerfull carpenter who knows his way around a shovel.
