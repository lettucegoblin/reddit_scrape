You should either attend a trade school based on something you&#39;re interested in or simply become a self-taught entrepreneur. </p>\n\n<p>I was the same way in high school (when I showed up) and tried 1 semester of college that led to ultimate failure. Turns out, college would not have taught me what I needed to know anyway. The success I&#39;ve achieved came from dedication to something I enjoy doing and it happens to pay pretty well too. Maybe I just got lucky but I have $0 in student loans to pay while others I know have to pay the same as a mortgage for their student loans. </p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is you don&#39;t have to go to college to be successful. Use your intelligence and put it to work for you without racking up a bunch of debt.</p>\n</div>",

High school was very difficult for me and I spent most of my summer in school making up credits. I even took the 12th grade a second time to get my grades up. College, however, was a breeze and I was easily cranking out 90%+ without putting in any effort. Eventually I got bored and stopped going to classes and instead spent all day at the bar or hanging out with friends.

        "body": "Highschool and college are just fundamentally different too. I think a big issue with public schools is teachers are kinda encouraged to keep people moving towards graduation even when they aren't really ready. So if the dumbasses are getting passed then for sure the smart kids aren't being challenged *at all* because they are dumbing things down to the lowest common denominator. So the smart kids breeze through thinking oh this is so easy.\n\nThen you go to college which is a for-profit system, so there is no money to be had by giving easy passes, and the students are paying versus the government. So if someone has to take the same class twice before they pass, that's just more money for the school.

I'm pretty sure it took me at least 2 years of private lessons before I started to play guitar more or less decently.\n\nThat said, if you actually still can't hold a tune longer than 10 seconds and are not exaggerating, you're clearly doing something wrong. A common mistake I see with novice players is that they start playing something, make a minor mistake, and instead of continuing instantly tighen up and stop when they could have just skipped a beat and kept going. \n\nI don't know what counts as \"screwing up\" in your book, but I think you simply set your standards too high. If you can't play a piece without making mistakes even after rehearsing it for ages, pick a simpler one. If you still can't make it, pick an even simpler one. Do so until you're comfortable enough with playing whatever you settled on. Next step is trying to identify what exactly prevents you from succeeding with the more difficult piece, e.g.: if you can't change finger positions on the frets fast enough, practice in a slower tempo; if you're having issues with your right hand technique, focus on that, and so on. As my guitar teacher always said, identifying the problem is 50% of its solution.\n\nAlso, how much time you spend practicing daily is also an important factor. 30-50 minutes a day is definitely not enough to train your muscle memory. Learning to play an instrument and learning songs is all about muscle memory and repetition. It's one thing to remember the melody in your mind, and another to be able to play it *without thinking*. It's like walking \u2013 you don't make a conscious decision to take each step when you're walking somewhere, you're doing it because the process is so ingrained within your muscle memory that it becomes automatic.\n\nHope this helps.
