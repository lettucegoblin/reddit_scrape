They were professional voice actors. We had Will Friedle as one and Cree Summer as another. But they were there just to fill in before the parts were cast with \"big name actors\". Will Friedle in particular was hilarious. He brought so much to his temporary role, he added stuff himself that they ended up keeping in the script.

His performance was just fantastic. He got to do a couple of incidental voices in the final cut. But he should have been the character that he did the scratch records for. It was also pretty jarring to hear someone else in the final film after Cree had absolutely made that role her own. Now I'm not knocking the final actors, they were good. But I personally feel like Will Friedle and Cree Summer should have played their scratch characters in the final film. I also got super excited when I realised it was Will Friedle.

It was also pretty jarring to hear someone else in the final film after Cree had absolutely made that role her own. Now I&#39;m not knocking the final actors, they were good. But I personally feel like Will Friedle and Cree Summer should have played their scratch characters in the final film. I also got super excited when I realised it was Will Friedle. I was a big Boy Meets World fan. I told the directors and anyone else I could find that day to tell them that OH MY GOD ERIC FROM BOY MEETS WORLD IS DOING THE SCRATCH! Everyone was just like, &quot;who?&quot; \ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div>",
