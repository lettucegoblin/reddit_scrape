Well, guess what! **Your employer CHOSE that amount too!**\n\n\"But why on earth does a tiny procedure run $100k?\", you ask.

The insurance company comes back to him and says, \"uh, no dude, you agreed to a network discount of 25%.\" **And then the doctor goes, \"oh yeah...well in that case, I'm going to bill $133,333.\"** And the insurance company goes \"sigh...I guess I can't stop you, but this isn't cool.\" And the doctor goes, \"you need me for network adequacy purposes, sorry not sorry.\"\n\n[**Side note: insurance companies make the most money when you're as healthy as can possibly be, and prescriptions and procedures are as affordable as they can possibly be.**]\n\nBut! Quick history lesson on why insurance companies started denying claims in the first place, because they didn't used to: **at some point, doctors began abusing the system.** Way back in the day, if you went to a doctor, they'd do what they thought was necessary to get you healthy, and they were reimbursed by insurance, and you paid your bill, and everyone operated in good faith. **But somewhere along the line, health care providers figured out that if they just tacked an MRI or a behavioral exam or an opioid prescription onto every case, they could make *bank*.** So they did. So insurance companies had to start making judgement calls, like \"hey, there's a whole bunch of options which might solve this issue before you go nuclear.\" It wasn't too long ago that doctors were EXCORIATING insurance companies...because insurance companies were dissuading doctors from prescribing opioids in massive quantities. \n\nThis history of abuse does two things. First, **it absolutely FUCKS with a well-meaning doctor who is just trying to get you healthy by prescribing a procedure which he thinks has the best chance of getting you healthy.** Second, **it underscores the philosophical problem we have in this country: sick people should not be a fucking profit center.**\n\nLast bit: you know how your medical insurance is separate from dental insurance and vision insurance? Well, insurance companies have been trying for DECADES to get them integrated. Guess who has moved heaven and earth to keep that from happening? Employers (actually, advocacy groups on behalf of employers, but still...). Why? **Because they're still not so sure about providing those benefits in the first place, and want the option to carve them out.** Same with prescription drug insurance (the Rx world is its own special nightmare which is even more complicated than medical insurance). Employers want, and fight for, the ability to carve prescription drugs out of their insurance offerings to some extent or another. **An integrated medical/dental/vision/pharmacy plan would be the most efficient and affordable insurance policy ever...and has almost 0% chance of happening at a large scale.**\n\nInsurance is a fucking hassle to deal with at every step.

        "body": "In every other country on Earth you have a service model for healthcare. The United States has an insurance model, which does not work for two reasons: the idea of \u2018rational actors\u2019 and because eventually everyone gets sick and eventually will die.\n\nLet\u2019s compare this insurance model to the one most people are familiar with: automotive insurance: you are driving your car alongside the road when suddenly, you are in an accident. We\u2019re you at fault? Was the other driver (if two or more cars were involved) at fault? You get a police report at the scene, call your insurance adjuster to assess the damage and depending on who is at fault and whether you have liability, collision, comprehensive and/or full coverage you later take your car to a body shop and pay your deductible and you later drive away with a repaired vehicle.\n\nThis model works for automobiles because most drivers that are insured will likely never be in an accident, limiting risk across a pool of safe drivers while keeping costs down for everyone, even drivers who do experience the occasional accident. Drivers may also take their time to find a garage to repair their vehicle and compare estimates for repairs from different garages that will provide that information, as well as argue with their and the other person\u2019s insurance to negotiate costs, otherwise known as being a \u2018rational actor\u2019 to make an informed decision as to how to proceed with the repairs and their related costs.\n\nHealthcare doesn\u2019t work like that. In an emergency you might be in and out of consciousness and are unable to make a rational decision as to which hospital to go to or which lifesaving procedure or medication should be administered.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>In every other country on Earth you have a service model for healthcare. The United States has an insurance model, which does not work for two reasons: the idea of \u2018rational actors\u2019 and because eventually everyone gets sick and eventually will die.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s compare this insurance model to the one most people are familiar with: automotive insurance: you are driving your car alongside the road when suddenly, you are in an accident. We\u2019re you at fault? Was the other driver (if two or more cars were involved) at fault? You get a police report at the scene, call your insurance adjuster to assess the damage and depending on who is at fault and whether you have liability, collision, comprehensive and/or full coverage you later take your car to a body shop and pay your deductible and you later drive away with a repaired vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>This model works for automobiles because most drivers that are insured will likely never be in an accident, limiting risk across a pool of safe drivers while keeping costs down for everyone, even drivers who do experience the occasional accident. Drivers may also take their time to find a garage to repair their vehicle and compare estimates for repairs from different garages that will provide that information, as well as argue with their and the other person\u2019s insurance to negotiate costs, otherwise known as being a \u2018rational actor\u2019 to make an informed decision as to how to proceed with the repairs and their related costs.</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare doesn\u2019t work like that. In an emergency you might be in and out of consciousness and are unable to make a rational decision as to which hospital to go to or which lifesaving procedure or medication should be administered. Also, instead of a single mechanic or garage working on your vehicle, you may have multiple doctors, surgeons, an anesthesiologist, a specialist, and some might be covered by your insurance while others may not. <del>Your car insurance company also isn\u2019t going to tell your mechanic exactly which parts to use to repair your vehicle in an itemized list,</del> and no hospital will tell you the prices for any of the services provided until after they have already billed for them.</p>\n\n<p>Also, remember risk pools?

        "body": "Yes, I work in America.\n\nSo insurance wants to know that an exam is actually necessary, so there's certain indications that they need to hear for certain exams.  In their mind there's no reason to go looking for DVT on a patient without leg swelling, leg pain, etc.  Otherwise doctors could theoretically go looking for blood clots on every patient that comes into the hospital for no reason other than to \"just check\", right?  So in order for them to pay, they need to hear WHY the doctor wants the exam, because technically hospitals could just tell their doctors \"Order every non-harmful exam that exists on every patient that walks through the door\" so that when the patient leaves the hospital, we've billed their insurance for like 500,000 dollars per person and the hospital can be like \"wElL tHe PaTiEnTs NeEdEd ThOsE eXaMs\".  But doctors don't really do that.\n\nInsurance is just this third fucking wheel that we have to play around and make happy or else we won't get paid, and a lot of times making them happy makes our job more difficult and annoying.  It's just bureaucratic bullshit boxes that we have to check because someone higher up (probably who never worked in healthcare) decided at one point that doctors can't just order whatever the hell they think they need for patient care and instead there needs to be certain acceptable reasons for any exam to be done.\n\nI understand the logic, but in practice, medicine doesn't always work that way where there's always an appropriate box to check.  Medicine is very much an art and adding more steps to it can slog everything down.  Say a patient is desatting and we haven't run blood work on them yet.  The doctor doesn't know anything about the patient and the patient is unable to communicate to explain his symptoms and needs.  After a physical exam the doctor determines he wants an abdomen ultrasound just to \"get a look around\" and see what's going on with the patient's organs.  Maybe he'll find something to explain what the hell is happening.  Well insurance needs to know that the exam is necessary and they'll say \"wElL tHeRe NeEdS tO bE a ReAsOn ThAt YoU'rE dOiNg ThIs\" and unfortunately \"We just want to have a look\" is not a reason insurance will pay for since you could \"just have a look\" at theoretically any patient that walks through the door.  Their box checking system doesn't take the situation into account.  Sure, if we waited for their blood work to come back, we would PROBABLY find some lab value elevated that could trigger a valid reason for the exam, but that involves WAITING for the labs to come back.  Sure if the patient was conscious and able to talk, they could probably tell us they had abdomen pain, which would trigger a valid reason for the exam, but the patient isn't conscious or has altered mental status or something.  So since we need this exam done, the doctor will often feed me some bullshit reason that we're doing the exam so that insurance will shut up and pay us for our work.  \n\nThe problem with healthcare is a difficult one to solve because there are a few hurdles.  \n\nHurdle #1 - Every healthcare worker wants to be paid well.  We are overworked, short-staffed, and went to school a long time to do what we do, and we would like our pay to reflect that.  This means that healthcare work does need to be profitable in some way. \n\nHurdle #2 - Making healthcare profitable means that the services we provide cannot simply be cheap or free.  I made 40 dollars an hour when I first started this job and I make more now that I have more experience under my belt.  I would not have gone to school and studied to learn this job if it didn't come with the promise of a comfortable paycheck.  I would have likely done some other job that paid just as well and required less schooling.  The guarantee of employment and good pay is what keeps new employees coming to the field, and lord knows we need all the new employees we can get.  So at the end of the day, there needs to be an entity with a large amount of money paying us money, whether it's the government or insurance companies, because we don't want that cost to fall to the patients.  \n\nHurdle #3 - This large entity (whether it be insurance or the government) is going to try and pay as little as humanly possible.\n\nI feel like socialized healthcare more-or-less doesn't successfully clear Hurdle #1 while also stumbling over hurdle #3 while privatized healthcare makes Hurdle #3 insufferable.  \n\nGovernment-owned hospitals, like you may find in other countries have VERY different priorities than for-profit hospitals.  You might think you would get better care in a government funded hospital than a for-profit hospital, but I honestly doubt it.  For-profit hospitals, like you will find in America have no issue giving a patient anything they might need.  Hospitals are incentivized to order as much for a patient as they can.  You might get exams you don't 100% need just because of the chance it might be useful.  This is because we get paid by insurance for everything we do on you, and as a result, you get more extensive care and sometimes that pays off and we catch something that saves a life or prevents a lot of heartache down the line.  Whereas socialized hospitals are incentivized to do as little as they can get away with for each patient.  This will save the government from needing to pay more than necessary, which they obviously prefer.  With privatized healthcare, the people in charge of telling the doctors what to do work for the hospital and want to be able to charge insurance companies as much as they can.  This results in a general feeling of \"ORDER ORDER ORDER AS MUCH AS THIS PATIENT NEEDS, GIVE IT TO THEM CAUSE WE GET PAID FOR EVERYTHING WE DO\".  The result is, I think, is generally a very good quality of care.  You never hear complaints about the quality of the American healthcare system, just the cost.\n\nWhereas my understanding of socialized healthcare would be like if the insurance people were the ones in charge of running the hospital, where they would micromanage providers, asking them \"Is this REALLY necessary?\" and \"Don't order this if they don't NEED it 100%\"  I don't know what country you're from, but I guarantee that whatever country it is, the people sitting at the very top of your healthcare system and telling doctors what to do are pretty detached from the reality of actually working in healthcare.  Chances are, if they work for the government, their priorities are keeping costs as low as possible so they can save the government money.  I don't have the answers to the problem, but all I know is I fucking hate the bureaucratic bullshit that comes with this job.  Sorry for the rant.",

I made 40 dollars an hour when I first started this job and I make more now that I have more experience under my belt.  I would not have gone to school and studied to learn this job if it didn&#39;t come with the promise of a comfortable paycheck.  I would have likely done some other job that paid just as well and required less schooling.  The guarantee of employment and good pay is what keeps new employees coming to the field, and lord knows we need all the new employees we can get.  So at the end of the day, there needs to be an entity with a large amount of money paying us money, whether it&#39;s the government or insurance companies, because we don&#39;t want that cost to fall to the patients.  </p>\n\n<p>Hurdle #3 - This large entity (whether it be insurance or the government) is going to try and pay as little as humanly possible.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like socialized healthcare more-or-less doesn&#39;t successfully clear Hurdle #1 while also stumbling over hurdle #3 while privatized healthcare makes Hurdle #3 insufferable.  </p>\n\n<p>Government-owned hospitals, like you may find in other countries have VERY different priorities than for-profit hospitals.  You might think you would get better care in a government funded hospital than a for-profit hospital, but I honestly doubt it.  For-profit hospitals, like you will find in America have no issue giving a patient anything they might need.  Hospitals are incentivized to order as much for a patient as they can.  You might get exams you don&#39;t 100% need just because of the chance it might be useful.  This is because we get paid by insurance for everything we do on you, and as a result, you get more extensive care and sometimes that pays off and we catch something that saves a life or prevents a lot of heartache down the line.  Whereas socialized hospitals are incentivized to do as little as they can get away with for each patient.  This will save the government from needing to pay more than necessary, which they obviously prefer.  With privatized healthcare, the people in charge of telling the doctors what to do work for the hospital and want to be able to charge insurance companies as much as they can.  This results in a general feeling of &quot;ORDER ORDER ORDER AS MUCH AS THIS PATIENT NEEDS, GIVE IT TO THEM CAUSE WE GET PAID FOR EVERYTHING WE DO&quot;.  The result is, I think, is generally a very good quality of care.  You never hear complaints about the quality of the American healthcare system, just the cost.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas my understanding of socialized healthcare would be like if the insurance people were the ones in charge of running the hospital, where they would micromanage providers, asking them &quot;Is this REALLY necessary?&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t order this if they don&#39;t NEED it 100%&quot;  I don&#39;t know what country you&#39;re from, but I guarantee that whatever country it is, the people sitting at the very top of your healthcare system and telling doctors what to do are pretty detached from the reality of actually working in healthcare.  Chances are, if they work for the government, their priorities are keeping costs as low as possible so they can save the government money.  I don&#39;t have the answers to the problem, but all I know is I fucking hate the bureaucratic bullshit that comes with this job.  Sorry for the rant.</p>\n</div>",

This prolonged my discharge date by about 2 more weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Still baffles me that a 150 year old disease doesn\u2019t have a direct cause, or like a \u201cwhat to avoid\u201d chart or something.</p>\n</div>",
