The reason is that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires ten times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance, than would support him in a civilized state, where the earth is cultivated. When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation, arts, and science, there is a necessity of preserving things in that state; because without it there cannot be sustenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth part of its inhabitants. The thing therefore now to be done is to remedy the evils and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society by passing from the natural to that which is called the civilized state.\n\n>-Thomas Paine",

        "body": "> It's bad economics and it's happening in my country of Finland. Cheap housing was constructed which only drove up demand for it. \n\nBy 'bad economics' I mean it doesn't work like that. I don't know the particular details but there is definitely more to it than this, increasing supply does not increase demand by itself and is actually an effective solution. Possibly demand for housing was already growing rapidly so prices still went up, but they would have gone up even more otherwise. Maybe the low prices people were expecting were unrealistic to begin with given the already pent up demand, and the market corrected their misconceptions. But in the end it's just an economic fact that putting more housing on the market will make the price of housing lower than it otherwise would have been.\n\n>Students were given benefits to housing. This caused the budget for said benefits to double because students obviously left dorms and cell houses and opted for more expensive apartments\n\nThis makes sense but its different because it directly stimulates demand and doesn't involve increasing the supply. Subsidies often distort incentives and end up counterproductive. For the same reason I agree that it's probably harmful to be handling loans and debts between nations like you're talking about. And many regulations also cause this kind of harm and could be repealed, for example many of the ones preventing new housing construction on behalf of the protectionist interests of people who already own real estate and want its value to increase as much as possible.\n\n>How do you preserve the civilized state then?\n\nI would say the complete relevant question is more how to\n\n>remedy the evils and preserve the benefits\n\nThe evils in this case being illustrated in the OP comic; we are obliged to work much more than we would in a state of nature, just for basic survival. Despite the vast resources available to society, derived from the natural world, rightfully all of ours, and which are more than sufficient yet not used to remedy this situation most of us are in. Thomas Paine goes on to describe the injustice of this and begin to describe a solution:\n\n>It is a position not to be controverted, that the earth, in its natural uncultivated state, was, and ever would have continued to be, the COMMON PROPERTY OF THE HUMAN RACE. In that state every man would have been born to property. He would have been a joint life-proprietor with rest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions, vegetable and animal.\n\n>But the earth, in its natural state, as before said, is capable of supporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to separate the improvement made by cultivation, from the earth itself, upon which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose from that parable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is the value of the improvement, only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s bad economics and it&#39;s happening in my country of Finland. Cheap housing was constructed which only drove up demand for it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By &#39;bad economics&#39; I mean it doesn&#39;t work like that. I don&#39;t know the particular details but there is definitely more to it than this, increasing supply does not increase demand by itself and is actually an effective solution. Possibly demand for housing was already growing rapidly so prices still went up, but they would have gone up even more otherwise. Maybe the low prices people were expecting were unrealistic to begin with given the already pent up demand, and the market corrected their misconceptions. But in the end it&#39;s just an economic fact that putting more housing on the market will make the price of housing lower than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Students were given benefits to housing. This caused the budget for said benefits to double because students obviously left dorms and cell houses and opted for more expensive apartments</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes sense but its different because it directly stimulates demand and doesn&#39;t involve increasing the supply. Subsidies often distort incentives and end up counterproductive. For the same reason I agree that it&#39;s probably harmful to be handling loans and debts between nations like you&#39;re talking about. And many regulations also cause this kind of harm and could be repealed, for example many of the ones preventing new housing construction on behalf of the protectionist interests of people who already own real estate and want its value to increase as much as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do you preserve the civilized state then?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would say the complete relevant question is more how to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>remedy the evils and preserve the benefits</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The evils in this case being illustrated in the OP comic; we are obliged to work much more than we would in a state of nature, just for basic survival. Despite the vast resources available to society, derived from the natural world, rightfully all of ours, and which are more than sufficient yet not used to remedy this situation most of us are in. Thomas Paine goes on to describe the injustice of this and begin to describe a solution:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a position not to be controverted, that the earth, in its natural uncultivated state, was, and ever would have continued to be, the COMMON PROPERTY OF THE HUMAN RACE. In that state every man would have been born to property. He would have been a joint life-proprietor with rest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions, vegetable and animal.</p>\n\n<p>But the earth, in its natural state, as before said, is capable of supporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to separate the improvement made by cultivation, from the earth itself, upon which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose from that parable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is the value of the improvement, only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor therefore of cultivated lands, owes to the community ground-rent; for I know of no better term to express the idea by, for the land which he holds: and it is from this ground-rent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think socialism is a great idea because of how useful the market can be and how everything starts breaking on its own when you try to pretend economics isn&#39;t real. But our current system absolutely has elements of enslavement also.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: especially in countries with much higher wealth inequality than Finland</p>\n</div>",
