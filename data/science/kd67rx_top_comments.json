Commercial HVAC systems have dedicated units in the right places for this sterilization. \n\n* UV light in the AC system will impact some virus that circulates through the system, but only if it is slow moving air to give it enough time to be exposed to UV-C light, and it does nothing to the air a sick person just spread around the room before it cycles via your AC. There is an air ionization option out there to disinfect air in the room, but not without [their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kd67rx/-/gfvcryl) risks.\n\n* Blacklight is a form of UV light (UV-A) and it's what a lot of LED strips are and are harmless both to humans and viruses.

Most settings you would use this for (say a section of a mall or hospital) would be moving (rough approximation) at least 10,000CFM (cubic feet per minute) across the unit coil or main ducts. Air volumes this large would expect the air to be moving up to 2000 feet per minute through the system (assuming VAV system. it may be a constant volume rooftop system that would have slightly lower air velocity, but still wouldn\u2019t work for more reasons). So simple math- 2,000 FPM, needs 30 seconds of exposure, that leads to a 1,000ft run of UV light to reach that 99%. Yes, maybe shorter exposure time will still lead to at least some neutralization, but the lengths of light required would still be massive and probably beyond the length of the longest main duct runs of most systems. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t even take into account that hospitals require their HVAC systems to be 100% outside air (aka all air entering the AHU is from the outside, and all the air in the hospital gets exhausted back to the outside). (EDIT: as pointed out, this last sentence was not entirely true, there is some recirculation of air in certain rooms in hospitals. I\u2019d still categorize a hospital in the same category as my next sentence however) Mass gathering areas in general (like a mall), require a significant percentage of fresh outside air as well.\n\nEdit: and for in home applications, typically the air is moving in the 500-1000FPM range. Using the quick math above, still not practical",

        "body": "Well in that instance, the problem with LED's is they are not very power efficient, have fairly short lifespan, and are extremely expensive.\n\nIf you want to treat fast moving air in an HVAC system you need a lot of power, and even up at 285nm these LED's aren't anywhere near the efficiency of their visible-light counterparts.  Similar situation with water treatment.\n\nNot that there are no use cases, just that you would have to be a lot more careful about the safety aspect.  Even with UVC in water treatment or HVAC, you need to still observe lockout policies and have system shutoffs for maintenance so people don't accidentally overexpose themselves while changing filters or checking coils.\n\nOne of the most effective uses for UVC light is shining it into the upper room of an occupied space.  This sort of system has been used for decades and it's quite effective, and reasonably safe with the 254nm traditional UVC tubes.  But at 285nm you would need a lot more safety measures, if it would even be possible to make a safe system for occupied rooms.\n\nAnother big use for UVC is purifying surfaces using high powered carts or permanently installed fixtures.  With the traditional UVC tubes you can get away with a motion sensor and a locked door, but 285nm would be a lot scarier because it's also getting into the wavelengths that can penetrate through glass and plastic.\n\nAgain- not saying this research isn't interesting or promising!  Just that there are reasons why we don't have UVC LED's installed in every business already.",

Even with UVC in water treatment or HVAC, you need to still observe lockout policies and have system shutoffs for maintenance so people don&#39;t accidentally overexpose themselves while changing filters or checking coils.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most effective uses for UVC light is shining it into the upper room of an occupied space.  This sort of system has been used for decades and it&#39;s quite effective, and reasonably safe with the 254nm traditional UVC tubes.  But at 285nm you would need a lot more safety measures, if it would even be possible to make a safe system for occupied rooms.</p>\n\n<p>Another big use for UVC is purifying surfaces using high powered carts or permanently installed fixtures.  With the traditional UVC tubes you can get away with a motion sensor and a locked door, but 285nm would be a lot scarier because it&#39;s also getting into the wavelengths that can penetrate through glass and plastic.</p>\n\n<p>Again- not saying this research isn&#39;t interesting or promising!  Just that there are reasons why we don&#39;t have UVC LED&#39;s installed in every business already.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "There's a whole lot of variation in the UV bands, even just inside of UVC.\n\nReally short wavelengths of ultraviolet cannot penetrate your outermost layer of skin, or the moisture on your eyes, so they are relatively safe.  Heck, wavelengths shorter than 200nm have trouble penetrating through AIR.  But then when you get a little longer, still in UVC, you hit a range that can penetrate into tiny organisms like bacteria and viruses but shouldn't be a problem for humans.  This is where 222nm excimer lamps live, and that's a very promising technology.  Moving longer in wavelength you get to traditional low-pressure mercury lamps at 253.7nm, which kills pathogens but can cause irritation in human eyes and skin.  When you go up another 10nm, that's roughly the peak for germicidal effectiveness, but it's more nasty for humans.  Then 275nm is where a lot of UVC LED's live- it's a decent wavelength because LED's can be manufactured more easily to hit 275 than shorter wavelengths, it's roughly similar effectiveness against pathogens to the 254nm traditional lamps, and it's not all that carcinogenic.\n\nWhen you get into UVB, with 285nm, that's in the range of wavelengths that actually make it to the surface of the earth from the sun.  285 isn't the peak for skin cancer yet, but it's starting to get bad, and you also still have the potential for irritation in the eyes.  Somewhere in here there is also a risk for developing cataracts.  295nm is roughly the peak for skin cancer risk, so this is why you have to wear sunblock outside.  But by the time you get to 320nm, you're in UVA, and risks are significantly less.  Germicidal effects at 320nm+ are also nowhere near what they are in the UVC range, but they still exist.\n\nThere's actually some degree of germ-suppressing effect even from visible light.  There are systems that use 405-430nm light, which is in the violet to blue visible range, to suppress bacteria and sometimes (through a catalyst) suppress viruses.\n\nThere are of course shorter wavelengths than UV that can be very dangerous to humans- x-rays, gamma rays, etc.  On the other end, when you go past visible light into longer wavelengths, things get to be quite safe for humans- infra-red, radio waves, micro waves, etc.  Obviously it's still possible to do bad stuff if you concentrate enough energy on a person, but it's probably going to do damage through heat and not via screwing up your DNA or whatever.",

High MERV filters can be problematic because 1) they naturally block more airflow due to the thickness, and 2) they catch more particulates, which blocks even more airflow over time.

This can cause increases in your power bills, quicker wear on parts, and (if it gets really bad) just generally poor cooling/heating. High MERV isn't bad at all, you just need a unit that supports it and to make sure they don't get too blocked off. If you own any animals, you'll notice very quickly how often you have to change high MERV filters (whether you do it or not).\n\nAlso, guys, please change your filters. Airflow is easily the most common reason as to why your house isn't cooling like it should.\n\nEDIT: That being said, yes. High MERV filters are effective and filter more allergens/particulates than thinner filters. But that comes with some trade-offs. Think of a strainer under a faucet. The thinner the strainer, the smaller foods you can hold in it. But as it fills, you'll see that the water has a harder time going through. Same applies to air filters as well.",
