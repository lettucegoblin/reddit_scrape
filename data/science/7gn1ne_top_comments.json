Its assumed that the truth has been crowdsourced, that a post that has thousands of upvotes must have had thousands of people confirm its veracity. </p>\n\n<p>This report from Pew shows that <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/\">78% of Redditors get their news from Reddit</a>. Redditors tend to be deeply collectivist, and herd around an opinion based on how many upvotes it has. The most upvoted comments are rarely the best comments or the ones which provide relevant information countering a narrative being built, <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/\">they are most commonly simply the first ones posted</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Think about how big of an opportunity this is for political campaigners. All you need to entrench a viewpoint inthe largely millennial progressive base of the site is to feed them a headline that conform with their opinion (which is why The Independent is on the front page on a daily basis over and over), and get the first few comments so that they are in agreement with the headline. </p>\n</div>",
