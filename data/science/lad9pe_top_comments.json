        "body": "Coming from a hospitality background from year's ago, the phenomena is prevalent in Hospitality as well as office and Dev roles.  \n\nFrom the hospitality route, as a chef the career path was obvious for BoH, dishwasher, cook, Jr.sous, Sous, Chef and that's it.  One or two sous positions is normal and with one chef position, the ''top' is a very small group of people.  Even at that role, being a Chef is the end of the line and in larger institutions the corporate chefs have in my experience been outside hires every time.  \n\nFoH had far more opportunities, host to server to bar to any number of office positions or management positions which all open the door for corporate positions or head office positions.  Apparently carrying plates doesn't mean you can't use a computer or transfer to an accounting role but for a cook to transfer into one of those roles is... It just doesn't happen.  \n\nI had a Sous chef who had 8 years with the company and had a finance degree and did his MBA, only after he quit and directly applied for a position did he get an interview (he left the company altogether eventually) but trying to get him a transfer or sponsorship?  He knew how to butcher and work the line, definitely not 'office material'.  Heck, even the second in command of the restaurant he made less than the bar manager who was a host two years before that...\n\nHeck, even most board meetings had the chef as the only representative at the table from BoH yet 8 people were part of the meetings.\n\nIT had similar issues.  Started in support, you're often pigeonholed into that role and growth or education are often overlooked and you need to leave your current company to even be considered.  I've seen 3 year support agents with great records get denied transfers into other roles or for education programs because they were only 'support' but the company would still outside hire others into Jr dev roles despite having a support background at another company.  \n\nHeck, even a friend recently after 15 years in the Public Sector and multiple promotions had to defend herself when interviewing for a new role because she was hired through a student program and this role is a senior position.  I get looking at her current role and weighing that jump to the position she's applying for, but to bring up what level she started at completely caught her off guard.  \n\nIt's an unfortunate mindset people have and it's why so many companies lose employees and why people are taught to switch companies if they want growth.  We had system setup where employees are pigeonholed at their point of origin.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Coming from a hospitality background from year&#39;s ago, the phenomena is prevalent in Hospitality as well as office and Dev roles.  </p>\n\n<p>From the hospitality route, as a chef the career path was obvious for BoH, dishwasher, cook, Jr.sous, Sous, Chef and that&#39;s it.  One or two sous positions is normal and with one chef position, the &#39;&#39;top&#39; is a very small group of people.  Even at that role, being a Chef is the end of the line and in larger institutions the corporate chefs have in my experience been outside hires every time.  </p>\n\n<p>FoH had far more opportunities, host to server to bar to any number of office positions or management positions which all open the door for corporate positions or head office positions.  Apparently carrying plates doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use a computer or transfer to an accounting role but for a cook to transfer into one of those roles is... It just doesn&#39;t happen.  </p>\n\n<p>I had a Sous chef who had 8 years with the company and had a finance degree and did his MBA, only after he quit and directly applied for a position did he get an interview (he left the company altogether eventually) but trying to get him a transfer or sponsorship?  He knew how to butcher and work the line, definitely not &#39;office material&#39;.  Heck, even the second in command of the restaurant he made less than the bar manager who was a host two years before that...</p>\n\n<p>Heck, even most board meetings had the chef as the only representative at the table from BoH yet 8 people were part of the meetings.</p>\n\n<p>IT had similar issues.  Started in support, you&#39;re often pigeonholed into that role and growth or education are often overlooked and you need to leave your current company to even be considered.  I&#39;ve seen 3 year support agents with great records get denied transfers into other roles or for education programs because they were only &#39;support&#39; but the company would still outside hire others into Jr dev roles despite having a support background at another company.  </p>\n\n<p>Heck, even a friend recently after 15 years in the Public Sector and multiple promotions had to defend herself when interviewing for a new role because she was hired through a student program and this role is a senior position.  I get looking at her current role and weighing that jump to the position she&#39;s applying for, but to bring up what level she started at completely caught her off guard.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an unfortunate mindset people have and it&#39;s why so many companies lose employees and why people are taught to switch companies if they want growth.  We had system setup where employees are pigeonholed at their point of origin.</p>\n</div>",
