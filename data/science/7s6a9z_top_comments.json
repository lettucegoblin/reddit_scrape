        "body": "I am always quick to point out the difference between anecdotes, evidence, and studies, but please bear with me as I see if I can get this point across.\n\nPersonally, I find that if I have an immersive gaming session, then the ability of my brain to distinguish between appropriate reactions for video-game-world versus real-world can start to blur. Not significantly, mind you, but it is there. Some specific examples:\n\nAfter playing GTA IV for a few hours, then getting on a (real) bus through the city, I noticed a building with a sloped roof that actually started at the ground, and my first thought was that it might be a stunt jump I need to complete.\n\nAfter playing any rally or racing game, and then driving, I can unintentionally find myself expecting to drive as I had been in the game. (I have never actually driven like that in the real world as a result, but the immediate response to real-world stimuli is still there and needs to be \u2018over-ridden\u2019 by rational thought.)\n\nOne of the more amusing ones; if I play simple puzzle games on my phone enough (candy-crush style games, or flow free, etc.) then I will start to see other objects as elements of the puzzle which my brain tries to \u2018solve\u2019; for example finding game-significant patterns in tiles on a bathroom wall.\n\nAs I noted earlier, these occurrences do not generally have any significance \u2013 they are simply thoughts I notice in response to real-world stimuli after gaming for a couple of hours. I acknowledge the thoughts, but do not take action based on them. As I also noted, I understand the difference between anecdotes, evidence, and studies. This is all anecdotal.\n\nBut what anecdotes can do is point to areas which should be studied. It is highly unlikely that I am \u2018unique\u2019 in this response to gaming \u2013 in a minority, perhaps. But given the sorts of responses people are concerned with when this topic comes up (school shootings, etc.) then minority responses can be very important.\n\nSo what I would like to see (or discover, if it\u2019s been done), is a study on how many people have such responses after gaming, and how significant their responses are. Since most things in human behaviour exist on a spectrum of some form, then surely this will be no different \u2013 I have extremely mild real-world / video-game-world appropriate-response-crossover, a lot of people don\u2019t have any crossover (again; anecdotal, based on people I\u2019ve talked to), but some may have much more significant crossover.\n\nI am now moving into pure conjecture (and I would hope that such a study would work to prove or disprove the following statements):\n\n1. I am not unique in having video-game-appropriate mental responses to real-world stimuli, post-gaming.\n1. There are people who are more significantly affected post-gaming than I am with such responses.\n1. Some of those people play video games more frequently, and for longer durations, than I do.\n1. Such people may find it very difficult to override their game-learned responses to real-world stimuli, and physically carry out game-appropriate responses in the real world.\n\nIf this is true (and that\u2019s a big if, but that would be the point of such a study), then there are people out there (maybe only a handful around the world) for whom it may be true that video games increase their violent behaviours. It is certainly not true for the general public. But when we are talking about significant, violent incidents resulting, then how many such people would need to exist for us to start to be concerned? Should the fact this is a possibility be enough to investigate?\n\nPersonally, I believe it is something we should be looking at \u2013 but not in the way the research I\u2019ve seen is doing it. I think **we shouldn\u2019t be asking \u201cDo video games increase violent behaviour?\u201d, but rather \u201cAre there people for whom video games can increase violent behaviour?\u201d**\n\nYou can liken this to many other mental/medical issues. For example, we don\u2019t ask \u201cDo people react (physiologically) unfavourably to the consumption of shellfish?\u201d because the answer would be, on average, \u2018no\u2019. But we do ask \u201cAre there people who react unfavourably to the consumption of shellfish?\u201d \u2013 and we all know the answer is yes \u2013 and it is for the sake of those people with allergies that we study such issues, even though they are a minority.",

But given the sorts of responses people are concerned with when this topic comes up (school shootings, etc.) then minority responses can be very important.</p>\n\n<p>So what I would like to see (or discover, if it\u2019s been done), is a study on how many people have such responses after gaming, and how significant their responses are. Since most things in human behaviour exist on a spectrum of some form, then surely this will be no different \u2013 I have extremely mild real-world / video-game-world appropriate-response-crossover, a lot of people don\u2019t have any crossover (again; anecdotal, based on people I\u2019ve talked to), but some may have much more significant crossover.</p>\n\n<p>I am now moving into pure conjecture (and I would hope that such a study would work to prove or disprove the following statements):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am not unique in having video-game-appropriate mental responses to real-world stimuli, post-gaming.</li>\n<li>There are people who are more significantly affected post-gaming than I am with such responses.</li>\n<li>Some of those people play video games more frequently, and for longer durations, than I do.</li>\n<li>Such people may find it very difficult to override their game-learned responses to real-world stimuli, and physically carry out game-appropriate responses in the real world.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If this is true (and that\u2019s a big if, but that would be the point of such a study), then there are people out there (maybe only a handful around the world) for whom it may be true that video games increase their violent behaviours. It is certainly not true for the general public. But when we are talking about significant, violent incidents resulting, then how many such people would need to exist for us to start to be concerned? Should the fact this is a possibility be enough to investigate?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I believe it is something we should be looking at \u2013 but not in the way the research I\u2019ve seen is doing it. I think <strong>we shouldn\u2019t be asking \u201cDo video games increase violent behaviour?\u201d, but rather \u201cAre there people for whom video games can increase violent behaviour?\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can liken this to many other mental/medical issues. For example, we don\u2019t ask \u201cDo people react (physiologically) unfavourably to the consumption of shellfish?\u201d because the answer would be, on average, \u2018no\u2019. But we do ask \u201cAre there people who react unfavourably to the consumption of shellfish?\u201d \u2013 and we all know the answer is yes \u2013 and it is for the sake of those people with allergies that we study such issues, even though they are a minority.</p>\n</div>",

Which is good; i agree with them. But it completely ignored any artistry that the medium possesses. And that's just infuriating.\nMovies can be violent and still be thoughtful and even beautiful. But it seems like to the average non-gamer, any game with violence becomes a power fantasy. And that is absolutely not always the case. But any sort of media coverage you see on the subject completely leaves out that games are an art form, and the best things they will say are about what sort of measurable, pragmatic benefits they offer. Like training surgeons.\nI feel like the reason a lot of people, especially people who are middle aged+, see video games in this way is because they didn't grow up with the archives upon archives of widely different game genres that we do now. They didn't see video games that were made to be beautiful--the games they grew up with were often rooted in gameplay alone, with a few exceptions. (This is all IMHO; i could be wrong.) I know anecdotal evidence is frowned upon, but when I was younger, my parents were not fond of me playing video games at all. It was only after i left the house and i finally explained to them one day the artistic value of some games, and why i enjoy the stories they tell, that they respected them a little more. Or in a different way. And that may be common knowledge on a site like reddit, but for the average person, i don't think it'll ever be heard.\n\n\ntl;dr IMO, video games receive a lot of flak because their artistic value is ignored in most common media.",

But any sort of media coverage you see on the subject completely leaves out that games are an art form, and the best things they will say are about what sort of measurable, pragmatic benefits they offer. Like training surgeons.\nI feel like the reason a lot of people, especially people who are middle aged+, see video games in this way is because they didn&#39;t grow up with the archives upon archives of widely different game genres that we do now. They didn&#39;t see video games that were made to be beautiful--the games they grew up with were often rooted in gameplay alone, with a few exceptions. (This is all IMHO; i could be wrong.) I know anecdotal evidence is frowned upon, but when I was younger, my parents were not fond of me playing video games at all. It was only after i left the house and i finally explained to them one day the artistic value of some games, and why i enjoy the stories they tell, that they respected them a little more. Or in a different way. And that may be common knowledge on a site like reddit, but for the average person, i don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever be heard.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr IMO, video games receive a lot of flak because their artistic value is ignored in most common media.</p>\n</div>",

If you consider the reward system of the brain as well as the basic principles of social neuroscience, then this makes sense. What people don't want is for video games to cause emotional dysregulation. Emotional dysregulation doesn't occur in a vacuum. In the case of a very frustrating, fast paced video game, a child with existing poor impulse control will only entrench their emotional outbursts. They simply implode under the strain of trying to juggle that sort of emotionally charged environment. A child with very good emotional regulation has a better sense of detachment from the game and is less likely to become emotionally off balance if their expectations are suddenly disrupted (like crashing off the side of a cliff in Mario Kart games). Routine can also have a desensitizing effect: many gamers do not find it frustrating to play very frustrating games, if they are single player and know the game very well. Their sense of familiarity removes the disruption of an unexpected scenario, therefore there is no emotional dysregulation.",
