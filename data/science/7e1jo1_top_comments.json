But the ability for hard working and smart people to make a better life though getting a fellowship to graduate school that waives incredibly high tuitions is a vital way we can come closer to that American dream. </p>\n\n<p>People with graduate degrees improve our economy in part by improving their overall earning potential. But you can&#39;t do that if you can&#39;t survive graduate school. $20k/yr in Boston was hard enough. Now congress wants to ensure that only people willing to take out crippling amounts of students loans or who have rich parents will be able to go to graduate school. Or, as the post suggests, we&#39;ll all just leave for greener pastures in other countries. </p>\n\n<p>The brain drain and reduction in scientific progress in America will haunt this country for decades to come.</p>\n</div>",

If you have any knowledge of how economics works this will make sense to you. \n\nThink about the reason WHY education is so expensive in the first place. It\u2019s obviously not because people can actually afford to pay for it on average, that\u2019s why there is so much debt. It\u2019s because the government gives millions upon millions in student loans every year, giving the illusion that people actually can pay. The government is allowing people to spend money to get something they can\u2019t afford, and since it\u2019s now the government\u2019s loan money being spent, schools can drive tuition fees as high as they dare. Now, let\u2019s say that the government does what it is doing here. In the very short term, the cost of education will seemingly skyrocket, and like many people here in the comments are echoing the sentiments of, many students will be simply unable to pay. However, what will be the effect of this? In economics, when the price increases, there is a movement left along the demand curve and right along the supply curve, and there exists a surplus of supply, where few consumers will pay at the current price.  Therefore, since universities are now not selling their profit maximizing amount, which is more or less at the market equilibrium price where most people can pay to go to school, schools will be FORCED TO DROP PRICES in order to encourage more people to attend them and bring in more revenue to stay afloat. Taking these market effects into account, in the long run this new tax bill will actually benefit the majority of consumers. \n\nNow in the short run, maybe say the next 2-3 years this will absolutely hurt students and hurt the advancement of science and higher education. That\u2019s exactly why so many people will resist this tax bill, and why it is the GOP suggesting the bill. They are more concerned with the long term financial and capital growth of the nation, rather than pleasing people right now. \n\nYou might, at this point(actually if read to this point thanks for hearing me out), if you understand economics, be wanting to yell at me about deadweight loss from taxes being increased. That\u2019s true. But another factor to be considered is that this bill is also aiming to simplify the tax code by eliminating loopholes, such as considering tuition waivers to taxable income. It would then be considered taxable income in the same way that lottery winners or game show winners are taxed on their winnings.\n\nWhen tuition waivers are taxed, schools have to give larger stipends to continue the same level of incentives, resulting in essentially the same series of cause and effect as I explained earlier.\n\nIf you want to have civil debate about this with me, please reply, since it can only help everyone understand the issue more clearly and in greater detail.

This change is really hamfisted in implementation and will cause significant damage.  Truthfully, I'm not sure what the proper implementation would be, but it certainly would not have been this.  As this policy stands, it's going to reduce the number of grad students and increase costs to students and universities.  I think it will also further a shift towards STEM programs from humanities as it is easier to charge a funding agency for a student than it is for TAing, which will further hurt humanities PhD programs. \n\n*edited for clarity",

I entered as an associate lecturer, with just a 4-year degree (doing engineering classes in English) at a private junior college in Japan (where, for better or worse, no specific teaching credentials are required beyond a recognized degree in your field).  They paid me decently (about 10% less than standard starting salary for my field).  Now I&#39;m able to get my master&#39;s at their associated university with my tuition covered by the school.</p>\n\n<p>I had sworn to never go into American academia after seeing all the ridiculous stuff you described, but I happened to stumble across my current position during an exchange program and am actually considering a career in academia (just not in the states).</p>\n\n<p>We need to have a discussion about the cost and utility of our teaching certification programs in the states.  Would I have been a better teacher with formal teaching education? Almost certainly.   However I was a teaching assistant for the first couple years before ever being given a class to teach on my own (as well as having worked as a tutor during college), as such most of my teaching &quot;education&quot; was on the job, while getting paid to do so.  As such I feel the first few years of my career have been &quot;value added&quot; rather than sinking me into more debt for little gain.</p>\n</div>",

No money, no support, no respect.

One friend just got hired as a junior high biology teacher with zero credentials, no experience, and an architecture degree.</p>\n\n<p>My mother has been teaching for 30 years, won awards for her curriculums, but never got her master&#39;s because of money issues (my dad did though.) My ex-girlfriend and my sister were both making $10K more than my mom&#39;s highest ever salary only 2-3 years out of college, and my ex works for the government too. They throw money at her because she got her master&#39;s, but her job is insanely boring and I could be in her same position with my graphic design bachelors if I&#39;d have gone for it right after graduation.</p>\n\n<p>Both parents moved their retirement up because things are so bad in the district. No money, no support, no respect. Our legislators gave them a COLA for the first time in 15 years and then cut it in half the next year, also destroyed their insurance (basically the only thing that makes teaching worth it.) </p>\n\n<p>This is their last year and my mom moved to a non-teaching position because it&#39;s not worth the crushing stress anymore. Really too bad we don&#39;t live in an area where teachers are compensated fairly and allowed to flourish and really teach their students. Not sure if there is freedom to truly teach anywhere anymore though. There are tight curriculums now and standardized testing for everything. My mother&#39;s amazing award winning salmon spawning curriculum is not used anymore.</p>\n</div>",
