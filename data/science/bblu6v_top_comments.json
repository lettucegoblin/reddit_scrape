        "body": "Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the \"point of no return\" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than \"it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,\" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.",

It&#39;s not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.</p>\n</div>",

Of course, a black hole emits no light, but you can make the same statement of curvature about lines of sight, instead. \n\nSo if you draw a line of sight from a camera to the black hole, the further from the center of the black hole you look, the more your line of sight is bent inward.

        "body": "**Short answer:** You're absolutely right that the shadow (the dark part) is where the black hole is \"blocking\" light. However, since light doesn't follow classically straight lines in general relativity, the hole can actually \"block\" more than what's directly behind it. The glowing stuff is gas we can still see because it's a) far away enough for its light to escape, and b) glowing with heat.\n\n\n**Long answer:** Picture how a classical shadow is made. We hold up our hand, shine a flashlight at it, and on the other side there's a black hand-shaped spot on the wall. That spot comes from the light that rain straight into our hand on its way to its final destination (the wall.) You can imagine beams of light, each one a little above the last, running into your hand, until finally one makes it just over your pinkie finger. That's the end of the shadow. Only light headed more or less directly at your hand is blocked; light that just barely grazes over hits the wall.\n\n\nNow consider the same situation with the black hole (say you've got a really big flashlight). The beams that leave your flashlight and head straight for the event horizon, where all light is inevitably eaten, is obviously doomed. That's *part* of the black spot. \n\n\nConsider then the light that would've made it just barely over the top of the event horizon. If light was classical, that'd be where the shadow ended. However -- and this is critical -- **gravity curves light.** Even if the light *left* your flashlight on a path that would juuust take it over the horizon, the immense gravity of the singularity pulls it off its straight-line path and into its maw. Not just that: light that would classically clear the black hole at quite a height [can get pulled back in](https://i.imgur.com/CftW74t.png), sometimes making several orbits around the hole as it spirals inevitably inward. This ends up making the \"shadow\" of the black hole significantly bigger than the event horizon itself. There's a way of seeing this image as both the front and the back of the black hole -- sort of a real-life sphere projection.\n\n\nEssentially, singularities would make pretty bad finger puppets.",

Or is it treated more like an exponential spectrum of density, approaching infinity as you approach the center of the mass? In this I would imagine that as the center's density (and therefore gravity) increases, matter at each successive atomic/subatomic level would settle into thinner and thinner layers. Like how a bigass snow pile can be basically solid ice at the bottom but fresh powder on the top, with the ice part getting denser and thicker as more snow packs on at the top.\n\nOr the gravitational force is so strong that matter no longer consumes the same volume of space it otherwise would?

The difference between the velocity you'd expect (just by normal addition) and the velocity that relativity says you'd actually measure is called the \"Lorentz Factor\", and it's `1/sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))` where v is your velocity and c is the speed of light. `c` is huge - in miles per hour it's 6.7x10^8, or 607 *million* miles per hour. So the term (v^2 / c^2 ) may as well be zero until v is very large - some significant fraction of the speed of light. When that term is near zero, the Lorentz factor is very close to 1, meaning there's not much impact from relativity, things work pretty much as you expect.\n\nFor an idea how fast you have to be moving before relativity matters, think about something moving just 1% the speed of light. So v = 0.01c. How fast is this? It's still more than 6 million miles per hour, so unimaginably fast. What effect does it have? Well (v^2 / c^2 ) would be 0.0001, so 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2 )) works out to 1.00005. In other words, even at this *absurd* speed, relativity only changes things by about 50 parts per million. That's still almost impossible to measure.\n\nThis is why we can safely ignore relativity in daily life, but it's not because it only effects light. Relativity is how the universe works, for *everything*. It's just that our experience in daily life only exposes us to a small portion of the possible phenomenon that are possible, so we don't have a good intuition for the bigger picture.",
