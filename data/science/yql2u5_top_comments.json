Of course with a headline like that it is going to attract readers from both within and outside academia, and some of the readers wont be able to tell if the research has been done properly or not. \nAdrian Mehic is now under investigation from the National Research Ethics Board for not conducting ethical research.</p>\n\n<p>The most disturbing part is that it was conducted without the subjects knowing they were part of the study, and therefore without their consent. Big no no. \nFuthermore the level of attractivness was decided by him going through the subjects social media and picking out what ge thougt were the most attractive pictures of them. These pictures were then sent to a &quot;jury&quot; consisting of about 70 persons, of which about half were high schoolers (!) to rate their attractiveness. As mention, all of this were done without their knowledge and is as a whole pretty skewed way to rate attractiveness. </p>\n\n<p>In his &quot;study&quot; he also dosnt mention that the absolut main part (in general 70-90%) of the students grades are decided by their final exams, which are only identified by their student IDs. The teacher grading never know which test belongs to which student and at lunds University they are in general not present at the final exams, except for like 10-15 min to answer a question or two. </p>\n\n<p>Obligatory Sorry for bad formatting and english, im writing from my phone in the bath.</p>\n</div>",

Interesting as a woman to read OP's linked study where it held true (advantages based on appearance) in both genders but dropped for females vs. males in remote settings. As a female who did remote studies during covid, I had my camera off as often as possible whenever it was allowed. It may be coincidence or just how it went down in my classes, but more guys kept cameras on in class vs. women. \\*`Note limited in the type of studies one can link since using Google Scholar and many academic studies on the topic are not free, online in full, or linkable (i.e. downloadable only or books)`\\*\n\nEdit1: noted, but not linked, studies 1-2 generations ago that found identical resumes got more interviews if male vs. female name.
