RCV is much clearer. As an example of Approval voting failing, imagine:</p>\n\n<p>Alice is the clear first choice of 60%\nBob is the clear first choice of 40%\nCharlie is the first choice of nobody but three quarters of the Alice people would strongly prefer Charlie to that dreadful Bob, and half of the Bob people would be okay with Charlie.</p>\n\n<p>So the vote is:</p>\n\n<p>15% Alice only\n45% Alice and Charlie\n20% Bob only\n20% Bob and Charlie</p>\n\n<p>With RCV, Alice would have won immediately. With Approval voting, Charlie wins. Is that really a good outcome? Does that really amount to &quot;no spoilers&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#39;ll stick with RCV as my preferred system. Let&#39;s see how it goes in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-referendums-elections-maine-courts-b5ddd0854037e9687e952cd79e1526df\">Maine</a>, okay?</p>\n</div>",

Australia has to constantly [remind themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/bbv5k2/federal_election_2019_you_cant_waste_your_vote_by/) to vote honestly and they've been at it for over a century. Plus, while RCV collects a lot of information from the voters, it analysis it in a very information inefficient way, only considering a sub-set of the information at a time, and literally discarding preference after it's decided to not be useful anymore. More information in isolation is certainly a plus, but you have to consider how efficiently it's used, and how much unnecessary complexity it adds to your system.\n\n>Example election\n\nIt's actually kind of funny that your bad Approval outcome is essentially demonstrating that it can sometimes elect a non-condorcet winner, when the real-life RCV example I provided *also* flails to elect the condorcet winner. If finding the condorcet winner was important to you, just use a [condorcet method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method), though I think you'll agree they can get complicated *fast* (and agree that unnecessary complexity should be avoided). You're smart enough to know that [not all elections even have condorcet winners at all](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox)! (There's much debate about the real-world incidence of elections without condorcet winners, though, with some estimates as high as ~9% and others considering it vanishingly rare.) I'm currently unaware of the relative ability of RCV or Approval in terms of how often each method finds the condorcet winner when one exists. I *think* they both tend to do fairly well in practice.\n\nIt's also important to note\u2013and both your critique of my critique and your example election hinted at this\u2013that the condorcet winner doesn't necessarily maximize the voting population's total happiness. Failing to elect the condorcet winner isn't necessarily a failure of the system, so long as you consider some other criteria more important.\n\nIn fact, in the case of *both* Burlington and your Approval example election, it may be possible that the candidate which maximized voter happiness was elected anyway, even if they weren't the condorcet winner. In the Burlington example, this could be because a smaller set of voters were absolutely stoked for the winner, concentrating a lot of happiness but maximising it for the total voter pool. Compare with the example you gave, and the *vast majority* of voters are okay with the results, again potentially maximizing happiness, but this time spreading it out amongst more voters. Both results fail to find the condorcet winner, but both results could have left the electorate more satisfied than doing so.\n\n>Does that really amount to \"no spoilers\"?\n\nAh, herein lies the rub, and potentially why you aren't very convinced about my spoiler example. What **is** a spoiler? Well first let's a address what a spoiler isn't. A spoiler **isn't** a winning candidate. Intuitively it's easy to see how that's not possible. \"I would have won if it weren't for the winner!\" ....\u00af\\\\\\_\u0ca0\\_\u0ca0\\_/\u00af\n\nA spoiler is a *losing* candidate that changes the *winner* of an election by running in the election, assuming voter preference doesn't change. (You can't really control for voters having unstable opinions.) Put rigorously, a method does not have spoilers if it satisfies the [Independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives). The introduction of a *losing* candidate should be irrelevant to finding the winning candidates.\n\nIn this way, RCV fails to avoid spoilers, because the order of candidate elimination matters, and introducing a losing candidate can change this order. The example I gave is the easiest way to see this, where if you removed the second place candidate from the race entirely, a different candidate would have gotten first place. In fact, competitive RCV elections can be fairly sensitive to order of elimination (same [chaos](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/) link) which can make independently verifying results through exit polls nearly impossible.\n\nAnyway, compare with Approval, where adding or removing losing candidates has no effect on the winners at all, since voters are free to consider their support for each candidate independent of all the others. (I shouldn't have to explain why approval is always easy to verify with exit polling.)\n\nThe existence of spoilers (and it's center-squeeze (and voters being morons)) means RCV still collapses to two parties in single-seat elections. I don't *necessarily* think Approval will break the duopoly when used in single-seat elections (some supporters seem to think it will, but there's not enough real-world evidence to suggest it will since most of the elections it's currently used in are single-party or no-party elections) but anyway RCV certainly won't. The [Australian Parliament](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia) is a great example, where they have a semi-proportional system in the Senate that allows minor parties to exist, but the minor parties are basically nonexistent in the House, because it uses single-seat RCV, which favors two parties.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe things I value highly for single-seat elections are: simplicity, voter satisfaction, independent verification, minimal distortion of aggregate opinion, and no spoilers. In that way, Approval is an excellent system. In many ways,  RCV is a decent system, but not necessarily in the ways that are important to me, and not necessarily in the ways that supporters claim. It's this second half that I spend so much time discussing, because good Lord I don't want election reform based on misrepresentations and half-truths.",

Maybe it's satire, but I think the above commenter was getting at the fact that I, the average voter, have no way to verify that the results are \"real\" or \"correct\" beyond simply trusting the election committees and news outlets. At the end of the day, the news outlets report the values given them by the election committees. Yes, they do exit polling, and they help \"provide transparency\" but they could be entirely made up. At least with actual ballots (what election committees use), they have physical evidence which *could be* recounted, (supposing a fair system).\n\nSo, if there was a big conspiracy, and someone wanted to mess with faith in the system, they would fabricate exit polls.
