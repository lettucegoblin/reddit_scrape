I was aware of the scope, but when you see the raw numbers behind the screaming silence of our culture when it comes to mental illness. \nThis kills about half as many people a year in the US as breast cancer and yet it is barely acknowledged.  It\u2019s even more staggering to think that the US has a fairly average suicide rate. Sadly most of the lowest scoring countries are more likely to have religious taboos than adequate care. \nThe guns make it too easy.  I would be surprised if there was much debate about that among those who\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts or more.  The silence is at least as deadly. \n\nEdit: Clarification - the issue is not the amount of coverage or the public awareness of the deaths.  The problem is that all that\u2019s talked about is the death.  It\u2019s like if all we ever talked about was car crashes but never how to drive or what makes vehicles safe.  We see the need to help people to be safe for themselves and others.  Suicides do tremendous harm to not only the victims but all those around them, sometimes fatal harm.  It\u2019s very much like a car crash but there are no classes, few advocacy groups and little conversation.  High schools have been talking to kids about getting drunk and driving for decades but suicide is still a taboo word in huge portions of the country. ",
