        "body": "For anyone wondering why The Weeknd is so popular, it is because he released his new album named After Hours, which is his 4th studio album. This album had a song named \"Blinding Lights\" which became very popular. I bet you heard it on the radio, but you just didn't know it was The Weeknd.\n\nAlso, most of his old, OG fans returned to him.\nIn 2012, The Weeknd made dark R&B songs with deep lyrics, dark meaning, and a unique sound. The album was named \"Trilogy\". In 2015 most of his old fans quit because The Weeknd started making mainstream, pop music. But, the old fans returned in 2020, because his new album is more similar to his old style. Especially because in songs from the new album like After Hours and Until I Bleed Out, he had a lot of references from his old album. For example, his Until I Bleed Out music video finally shows how it looks inside the House of Balloons (one of his OG mixtapes)  and OG fans wanted that since 2011. I also want The Weeknd to make songs similar to the ones from Trilogy, but I don't want him to live that lifestyle again, because he was homeless, and struggled with many things such as depression and drug addiction. I want the old sound not his lifestyle. Also, if he makes music like he used to in 2011, his popularity will drop a lot, because that music is the exact opposite from mainstream, and no one will see it on TV or radio. Just listen to \"Loft Music\" or \"The Party & The After Party\". They are the opposite of mainstream, and the lyrics are too deep and dark to be put on radio.\n\nBtw I highly recommend you listen to that \"Trilogy\" album. I first listened to it 4 years ago, and I am still obsessed with it to this day. It is pretty much the only music I listen to. It never gets old. Also, the lyrics are so deep... for example, look at the song \"Twenty Eight\". I listened to it countless times, and every-time listen to it, I discover that the lyrics are even more deep than I thought, and they mean even more. The more I listen to it, the more I discover about it. To this day, I still bet I haven't discovered even half of the meaning in Trilogy. Its mind-blowing how someone made in 1 year an album, that, I, after 4 years of constant listening to it, still haven't discovered even a half of the meaning.",

The album was named \"Trilogy\". In 2015 most of his old fans quit because The Weeknd started making mainstream, pop music. But, the old fans returned in 2020, because his new album is more similar to his old style. Especially because in songs from the new album like After Hours and Until I Bleed Out, he had a lot of references from his old album. For example, his Until I Bleed Out music video finally shows how it looks inside the House of Balloons (one of his OG mixtapes)  and OG fans wanted that since 2011. I also want The Weeknd to make songs similar to the ones from Trilogy, but I don't want him to live that lifestyle again, because he was homeless, and struggled with many things such as depression and drug addiction. I want the old sound not his lifestyle. Also, if he makes music like he used to in 2011, his popularity will drop a lot, because that music is the exact opposite from mainstream, and no one will see it on TV or radio. Just listen to \"Loft Music\" or \"The Party & The After Party\". They are the opposite of mainstream, and the lyrics are too deep and dark to be put on radio.\n\nBtw I highly recommend you listen to that \"Trilogy\" album. I first listened to it 4 years ago, and I am still obsessed with it to this day. It is pretty much the only music I listen to. It never gets old. Also, the lyrics are so deep... for example, look at the song \"Twenty Eight\". I listened to it countless times, and every-time listen to it, I discover that the lyrics are even more deep than I thought, and they mean even more. The more I listen to it, the more I discover about it. To this day, I still bet I haven't discovered even half of the meaning in Trilogy. Its mind-blowing how someone made in 1 year an album, that, I, after 4 years of constant listening to it, still haven't discovered even a half of the meaning.",

        "body": "He is more popular because he released his new album named After Hours, which is his 4th studio album\n\nAlso, most of his old, OG fans returned to him.\nIn 2012, The Weeknd made dark R&B songs with deep lyrics, dark meaning, and a unique sound. The album was named \"Trilogy\". In 2015 most of his old fans quit because The Weeknd started making mainstream, pop music. But, the old fans returned in 2020, because his new album is more similar to his old style. Especially because in songs from the new album like After Hours and Until I Bleed Out, he had a lot of references from his old album. For example, his Until I Bleed Out music video finally shows how it looks inside the House of Balloons (one of his OG mixtapes)  and OG fans wanted that since 2011. I also want The Weeknd to make songs similar to the ones from Trilogy, but I don't want him to live that lifestyle again, because he was homeless, and struggled with many things such as depression and drug addiction. I want the old sound not his lifestyle. Also, if he makes music like he used to in 2011, his popularity will drop a lot, because that music is the exact opposite from mainstream, and no one will see it on TV or radio. Just listen to \"Loft Music\" or \"The Party & The After Party\". They are the opposite of mainstream, and the lyrics are too deep and dark to be put on radio.\n\nBtw I highly recommend you listen to that \"Trilogy\" album. I first listened to it 4 years ago, and I am still obsessed with it to this day. It is pretty much the only music I listen to. It never gets old. Also, the lyrics are so deep... for example, look at the song \"Twenty Eight\". I listened to it countless times, and every-time listen to it, I discover that the lyrics are even more deep than I thought, and they mean even more. The more I listen to it, the more I discover about it. To this day, I still bet I haven't discovered even half of the meaning in Trilogy. Its mind-blowing how someone made in 1 year an album, that, I, after 4 years of constant listening to it, still haven't discovered even a half of the meaning.",

I bet you heard it on the radio countless times, but you just didn't know it was him.\n\nAlso, most of his old, OG fans returned to him.\nIn 2012, The Weeknd made dark R&B songs with deep lyrics, dark meaning, and a unique sound. The album was named \"Trilogy\". In 2015 most of his old fans quit because The Weeknd started making mainstream, pop music. But, the old fans returned in 2020, because his new album is more similar to his old style. Especially because in songs from the new album like After Hours and Until I Bleed Out, he had a lot of references from his old album. For example, his Until I Bleed Out music video finally shows how it looks inside the House of Balloons (one of his OG mixtapes)  and OG fans wanted that since 2011. I also want The Weeknd to make songs similar to the ones from Trilogy, but I don't want him to live that lifestyle again, because he was homeless, and struggled with many things such as depression and drug addiction. I want the old sound not his lifestyle. Also, if he makes music like he used to in 2011, his popularity will drop a lot, because that music is the exact opposite from mainstream, and no one will see it on TV or radio. Just listen to \"Loft Music\" or \"The Party & The After Party\". They are the opposite of mainstream, and the lyrics are too deep and dark to be put on radio.\n\nBtw I highly recommend you listen to that \"Trilogy\" album. I first listened to it 4 years ago, and I am still obsessed with it to this day. It is pretty much the only music I listen to. It never gets old. Also, the lyrics are so deep... for example, look at the song \"Twenty Eight\". I listened to it countless times, and every-time listen to it, I discover that the lyrics are even more deep than I thought, and they mean even more. The more I listen to it, the more I discover about it. To this day, I still bet I haven't discovered even half of the meaning in Trilogy. Its mind-blowing how someone made in 1 year an album, that, I, after 4 years of constant listening to it, still haven't discovered even a half of the meaning.",

The album was named \"Trilogy\". In 2015 most of his old fans quit because The Weeknd started making mainstream, pop music. But, the old fans returned in 2020, because his new album is more similar to his old style. Especially because in songs from the new album like After Hours and Until I Bleed Out, he had a lot of references from his old album. For example, his Until I Bleed Out music video finally shows how it looks inside the House of Balloons (one of his OG mixtapes)  and OG fans wanted that since 2011. I also want The Weeknd to make songs similar to the ones from Trilogy, but I don't want him to live that lifestyle again, because he was homeless, and struggled with many things such as depression and drug addiction. I want the old sound not his lifestyle. Also, if he makes music like he used to in 2011, his popularity will drop a lot, because that music is the exact opposite from mainstream, and no one will see it on TV or radio. Just listen to \"Loft Music\" or \"The Party & The After Party\". They are the opposite of mainstream, and the lyrics are too deep and dark to be put on radio.\n\nBtw I highly recommend you listen to that \"Trilogy\" album. I first listened to it 4 years ago, and I am still obsessed with it to this day. It is pretty much the only music I listen to. It never gets old. Also, the lyrics are so deep... for example, look at the song \"Twenty Eight\". I listened to it countless times, and every-time listen to it, I discover that the lyrics are even more deep than I thought, and they mean even more. The more I listen to it, the more I discover about it. To this day, I still bet I haven't discovered even half of the meaning in Trilogy. Its mind-blowing how someone made in 1 year an album, that, I, after 4 years of constant listening to it, still haven't discovered even a half of the meaning.",
