Once this is all over, they will do estimations on actual dead and it will probably be higher. In Madrid, Spain, to take an example, last month 4700 people died in retirement homes when normally it's about 1000 per month. Of the 4700 dead, the confirmed dead due to coronavirus is about 900 and is probably much higher. Another example is China obviously lying on their dead statistic, and Ecuador, with people having to incinerate their loved ones in the streets, yet only having 270 dead officially.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Although this is scary and the spanish flu was a billion times worse than this (although maybe if it would have appeared in modern times it wouldn&#39;t have due to our more modern medicine), it is true that the deaths there are on estimations, and the deaths for Covid-19 there are only confirmed deaths. Once this is all over, they will do estimations on actual dead and it will probably be higher. In Madrid, Spain, to take an example, last month 4700 people died in retirement homes when normally it&#39;s about 1000 per month. Of the 4700 dead, the confirmed dead due to coronavirus is about 900 and is probably much higher.
