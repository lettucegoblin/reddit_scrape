Without detracting from the people who are losing homes in affected areas and obviously have it much worse.... this smoke is fucking horrendous. We\u2019ve had multiple days where we\u2019ve had the worst air quality in the world. Just about every single day from the beginning of December smoke has choked the city, stinging your eyes and making your nose and throat itch. On the bad days it\u2019s so thick you can\u2019t see 25m into the distance and even inside office buildings and homes there\u2019s a smoky haze. It\u2019s fucking oppressive. It\u2019s something that affects so many aspects of normal life. I\u2019ve been waiting weeks for an opportunity to wash sheets but can\u2019t because there\u2019s no point in hanging them out in the smoke. The smoky air is so hazardous that health officials are telling people to avoid exercise and stay indoors, I\u2019m itching to get outside and go for a swim or ride my bike but I can\u2019t. We\u2019ve had relentlessly hot days, made worse by the fact that the smoke is so thick you can\u2019t crack a window open at night which leads to many sleepless nights when you don\u2019t have air con.

The whole coast is burning, when usually at this time of year half the city is on holiday down there so we\u2019ve all had to cancel holiday plans. I know it\u2019s a trivial thing to complain about smoke and cancelled holidays when fire is a much more pressing threat, but it really is genuinely depressing. Especially when there doesn\u2019t seem to be any end in sight, and you worry this is just the new normal. I will never take for granted clean air that doesn\u2019t burn your eyes and make you feel sick ever again.",

They\u2019re also using the army barracks on the edge of town as refuge centres, and a friend who runs a caravan park here said they had 72 caravans check in on the 2nd/Jan when the new evacuation orders came in, with more trying yesterday. Air quality got up to 1000 yesterday where 150+ is \u2018unhealthy\u2019 for everyone, woke up feeling quite unwell with a headache and sore throat from breathing it in overnight- we then closed the house up and sealed the aircon. Overall, I\u2019m in an extremely lucky position where I don\u2019t have to pack up valuables or even think about leaving, but there have been many people coming here that have lost properties or have no idea if their properties will be safe when they return (including several of my friends from nearby affected areas).</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\n\nTldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I understand they&#39;re way larger, but what I was getting at is that the ratio is really one-sided because the amount of ash that drops from the sky, even directly adjacent a massive fire, isn&#39;t really what some might imagine. It&#39;s a fine layer of fluffy dust that isn&#39;t really very acidic, while the Pacific is massive and constantly circulating.</p>\n\n<p>If instead of 1 teaspoon of ash, I took 100 teaspoons of ash and threw it in a swimming pool, it wouldn&#39;t do much, and my guess is the ratio of ash added to water in the pacific would be even smaller. I&#39;m not an oceanographer so I might be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine in more confined systems like rivers, deltas, and small bays they might see some direct impact from ash and related acidification. But the Pacific ocean is just...giant. Increase the size of the fire and the ocean is still just massive.</p>\n\n<p>Out of curiosity I took a few minutes to search online and there are a few articles from oceanographers regarding the impact of ash on the oceans and they seem to all point to algal blooms as the biggest possible issue, I couldn&#39;t actually find one that mentioned ocean acidification via addition of ash. If anything it would simply be the release of CO2 that would lower the pH.</p>\n</div>",
