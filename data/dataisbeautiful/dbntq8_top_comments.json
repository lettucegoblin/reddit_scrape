The object is moving at light speed through the spatial dimensions; i.e., all of its speed devoted only for its motion through Space; and there is no motion through time. This means that time does not exist for objects travelling at the speed of light.\n\nHence, your answer. Objects travelling at speed of light do not experience time.

        "body": "I'm going to copy [my own post from 4 years ago](https://pay.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pd6jk/how_does_superluminal_ftl_transmission_of/) where I tried to explain this:\n\nA brief divergence for definitions: your \"light cone\" is the area of spacetime that constitutes the past and the future for you.  It's actually a hypercone, since spacetime is 4-dimensional.  Your future light cone is a sphere expanding out from you at the speed of light into the future -- this is the area of spacetime your actions can affect.  Your past light cone is a sphere expanding out from you at the speed of light in the past -- this is the area of spacetime that can possibly have had any effect on you.  Any event outside your light cone is not strictly in the past or future for you -- nothing out there can either affect or be affected by you.\n\nYour \"absolute future\" is the area of spacetime that is in the future for you in every possible (subluminal) reference frame; your \"absolute past\" is in the past for you in every possible (subluminal) reference frame.\n\nSince I work in infosec and cryptography, I'm going to name our hypothetical people after the usual characters in crypto examples, Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave (A, B, C, and D.)\n\nThe simplest case of how FTL causes problems is an \"ansible\" -- a perfect FTL radio. If Alice and Bob are in the same inertial reference frame (i.e. they're traveling in the same speed & direction, regardless of how far apart they are), the ansible sends messages between them instantaneously.  We're going to imagine that they're quite far apart, say a light-year or so.\n\nFrom Alice and Bob's perspectives, spacetime is \"normal\" -- anything in their past light cones is \"the past,\" anything in their future light cones are \"the future\", and anything outside their light cones is neither in the past nor the future -- those events cannot have any impact on them, and they cannot influence those events, so \"when\" they happened is immaterial. Now, their ansibles provide them with a kind of \"soft\" causality violation -- if Alice sends Bob an FTL message, it arrives at Bob's ansible before light would -- thus creating an event outside of Alice's future light cone. But this is mostly okay, because while the event is outside of Alice's future light cone, it's still in her absolute future -- she influenced an event that is still forward of her location in a timelike direction, even if it's not in her future light cone.\n\nHowever, now we'll introduce Carol and Dave.  Carol & Dave are not in the same reference frame as Alice and Bob -- they're in spaceships, flying at high (but still subluminal) speeds relative to Alice and Bob in another direction.  Let's say they're going 0.5c.  Due to relativistic effects, their light cone is \"tilted\" with respect to Alice and Bob's -- it is possible for an event that is in the \"future\" for Alice and Bob to be in the \"past\" for Carol, because of the time dilation effects and their relative positions.  This \"tilted\" light cone is called a Lorentz transformation of spacetime.\n\nThe problem comes in when Carol and Dave have ansibles, too. At this point, Alice can send a message via Bob, Carol, and Dave that is relayed into her absolute past. We don't have the weak causality violation from above -- we now have Alice receiving a memo from her future self yesterday.\n\nHow it works is this:  Alice and Bob are in the same frame, so Alice ansibles a message \"instantly\" to Bob.  This is in the absolute future for both of them.  Bob hands the message off to Carol, who is very nearby but moving at 0.5c, and thus in a different reference frame.  Once again, this was in the absolute future for both of them.  Carol ansibles this message to Dave, who is in the same reference frame as she is, so once again, it's in the absolute future for both of them.  But because of the \"tilt\" in Carol & Dave's spacetime relative to Alice & Bob's, this transmission went into Alice and Bob's absolute past!  Dave, who is very close to Alice but (due to his speed) in a different reference frame, hands the message off to Alice... who receives it well before she sent her initial message to Bob.\n\nIt turns out that while the problem is easiest to understand with ansibles sending instant communication, the math works out such that you get this problem even if you have to replace your ansibles with courier spaceships going 1.0000001c. The situations just have to get more and more contrived and take more and more time (quickly getting to the point where causality violations would not become apparent in a human lifetime, or even human civilization's lifetime,) but if you can communicate faster than light in any way to someone else within your own reference frame & someone in a different reference frame, you can get a memo from your future self, no matter how that communication occurred (even if they're using convenient space-bending warp drives, or stable wormholes, or magic.)\n\nTo try to illustrate, see [my crappy MS paint diagram](http://imgur.com/rSaYIPI).  The red line is Alice transmitting to Bob -- this direction is spacelike (i.e. it moves through space with no time passing) to them.  The green line is Dave transmitting to Carol -- this direction is spacelike to Dave and Carol in their Lorentz-transformed spacetime, but it is *not* spacelike to Alice and Bob, it moves backwards in time, intersecting Alice's worldline at a point before she made her initial transmission!",
