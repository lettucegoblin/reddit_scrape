I inspected several other prestigious and expensive universities.  I found the same.\n\nMy conclusion was that the rise in tuition over the years for private prestigious institutions at least is due largely to a rise in bureaucracy.  Of course, I didn't have access to all of the information that I needed to verify this conclusion, but the consistency that I found with the data I had was enough to convince me.\n\nPart of it has to do with rules and regulations surrounding various federal funding.   It requires significant oversight to follow the rules closely.  Some of it requires its own bureaucracy to obtain.  Part of it is due to doing what Universities are supposed to do.  Managing endowments, providing student health care, managing the small cities that they actually are from telecommunication services to housing to providing power, cooling, data centers, etc.  Everything has it's own layer of bureaucracy.  Some thick, some thin, but there are management layers, worker layers, the people who decide on the rules, the people who audit the rules, the people who do training, the people who manage emergency planning, the people who cooperate with the surrounding cities and how that cooperation manifests itself on campus.  (For instance, in a major disaster, the university ends up being a resource for temporary housing, telecom/internet, office space, and all kinds of other things - someone has to come up with a plan, ensure that the infrastructure always supports that plan, the plan is communicated across all levels of management across different structures within the university, and that the cities' communication is equally complete and parallel to what the university is doing.  There are things like managing 9-1-1 and locating ip phones when they've been moved in realtime with emergency services.  How to provision cable service in the dorms.  And there's an endless list of more.  How to segment the staff and the faculty.  How to manage all the various unions on campus.  How to manage intellectual property created by faculty in cooperation with students.  How to manage recruiters.  How to manage things like parking and lighting.  How to keep campuses secure but open.  How to deal with endangered species on campus.  How to maintain flowers.  All of that takes the workers that execute, the management layer, the executive layer, the PR layer, the legal layer, the HR layer, etc.  And you haven't even gotten started if the University maintains a hospital or does major research in any number of fields.\n\nSo how is this different than it was in 1980?  Less regulations.  Lower expectations of the environment.  Less legal issues.  Less fundraising.  Lower salaries.  And all of that means less staff.\n\nEndowments definitely fund the overflow.  They fund operational expenses. Buying all the trucks and cars and inventory across everything.  They fund the emergencies.  They fund what wasn't budgeted for and what can't be paid for by federal/state/local/private funding because of one rule or another.  They fund all kinds of things and they have to primarily fund it from earned interest or the endowment shrinks and eventually disappears.  Some end up paying exorbitant fees associated with the investments.\n\nIt's all a lot more complicated than I gave it credit for, and I don't work in finance so I really didn't have a window into everything.  \n\nI could go on, but I'm not sure anyone is ever going to read this.  Just a little perspective from someone who tried to look into it a bit.",

Highly educated people tend to command higher salaries, and a university tends to prefer highly educated staff at most levels of the organization. So costs tend to increase for a college faster than the average for all occupations/professions.\n\nAlso, let's not forget that (1) in a lot of colleges, international students make up almost 20% of enrolled students, and (2) international students' families are willing to pay whatever the college is willing to charge for \"pre-scholarship\" gross tuition. This is because such students don't receive scholarships.\n\nIf you don't like how expensive something is, blame the large segment of buyers who are willing to pay the high price. Right now, that is not domestic American students (as the sentiment of the comments here shows). We don't want to put 2 and 2 together, to overlay the rise in F-1 visa student enrollment to the surely coincidental acceleration in gross and net tuition. \n\nThey are *not* \"subsidizing your tuition\", as many defenders of international students like to believe. ***Their*** willingness to pay more is inflating *your* student loan balance and out-of-pocket college expenses.\n\nIt works a lot like private health insurance. The gross billing rate is based on the rate charged to the highest-paying payer (in medicine, that's the insurance comopany). If the insurer doesn't pay the full amount, the same price has to apply to the patient when billing for out-of-pocket costs. \n\nHow does this analogy apply? The international students and their families are like the huge private insurance companies, the universities are akin to the healthcare provider, and the domestic American students are the poor sap who gets billed insurance-level prices but was provided with inadequate \"coverage\" (scholarships/grants).\n\nSo we ***literally cannot*** just discuss the government subsidy problem without also taking a deeper look into the ***root cause of the pricing problem***.",
