He died on his 16th birthday and, oddly enough, it was because he got out and was run over.\n\nAnyway, I digress. The daughter cat often went out of her way to take care of him. Followed him from room to room, always put up with his crazy antics (for a \"sick\" cat, he never acted like it and was always extremely playful), always let him have food first, and always let him have all the attention. After his passing I could tell she was depressed because she would kind of mope around, always slept in the same spots he did, and so on. But after a while she slowly changed and her personality really started to shine through. She wasn't having to take care of him anymore and was the sole cat getting the affection. Was night and day difference in personality. \n\nShe passed away, years later, at the age of 19. When he died I was upset because he was probably the \"best\" cat I had ever had (this dude would high five me when I came home everyday) but I was grateful I got so much extra time with him and knew it was coming for a long time. With her it was a slow decline over about 6 months and it crushed me. Driving to the vet with her that last time I broke down. She was in my lap the whole time and, as if on cue, when I started to tear up, she reached up with her paw and put it on my chest. She was always so sweet and was always good at recognizing pain in others (people or animal). Miss them both. Hug and love your cats, dogs, humans. You never know when they'll be gone.",

They\u2019ll understand their friend of so many years is dead. \n\nWhat they won\u2019t understand is if you go away one day with their friend, and come back without them.

And every night without fail he'd slowly saunter into the living room, climb onto the couch as best as his old bones could, and lay down with his head in my lap. It was a sweet little gesture from him that always made me smile.\n\nEventually he got cancer in one of his leg bones and could hardly walk let alone climb on the couch, so i returned the favor by laying on his dog bed with him while i was on my phone. We had to put him down soon after that in December 2018, but for a few months after that when i sat on the couch i always thought i had seen him walking in out of the cornor of my eye.",

You should separate the new cat in a room all to themselves for 2-3 days. Food dish for your old cat in the same place. New food dish for the new cat away from the door. Obviously spend time with both of them separately. Then, move your cats food dish and new cars food dish on either sides of the door and feed them at the same time. This will draw them closer and get a little bit more curious as they can already smell each other they might not want to approach each other. Do that for about 2-3 days and don't break the routine. Next, take a dry washcloth and rub your more resident cat with it getting their scent on it (or maybe something your cat always lays on) and a dry washcloth and do the same to the new cat (or give them something to lay on when they first arrive for their scent) and place that on opposing sides of the door near the food to get used to the scent of the other cat for about 2-3 days. \n\nThen you can start to slowly introduce them to each other (in the room of the new cat). Make sure that it is supervised to separate if any conflict arriese and if so, separate and go back a step or two. \n\nOnce they start to warm up to each other (most likely the cat who's been there longer) than you can start to step back and let them interact on their own while you're still in the same room for conflict issues, just try not to intervene unless you can tell somethinf might happen (because you won't always be there and won't always be available to intervene). \n\nIf you follow these steps (you don't have to and can look up your own methods, these are just what I've learned from vets and various sites) you should have two new friendly cats!\n\nI haven't had any issues with my cats that I have now or even cats in the past by following these steps; but did in the past when I was unaware how to introduce a new cat into the home and thought they would just get along. \n\nHope this helps!",

He was as loyal and as kind as the day was long.\n\nWhen I was about 10, my father met a woman online and moved us to the middle of nowhere to live on a farm with her. Bear stayed behind because that was the way it was going to be.\n\nIt was only the next Summer that I found out Bear passed away after I left when my Grandmother brought me his collar. She couldn't stand to tell me over the phone. I felt like I had abandoned my best friend and killed him. I carried his collar in my footlocker between move and move for nearly a decade before I finally let go of it. \n\nMy throat aches and my eyes burn just remembering. Thank you for reminding me. I regret forgetting.",
