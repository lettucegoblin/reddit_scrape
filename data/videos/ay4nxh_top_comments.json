Learn everything you can and use your knowledge to advocate for  specific treatments. If you can prove that a specific drug or combination of drugs is more effective, oncologists will likely approve that treatment.

I wondered why she didn't go for checkups regularly, but she did, however, the cancer isn't detectable by the standard tests doctors run. It's one of those nasty things, hidden from you until it's too late.\n\nIt was so hard to take. Unbelievability difficult for her and our family. In the end, we had to accept it for what it is. She passed away peacefully (the painkillers rendered her semi conscious) with all of us by her side. It was my first time watching someone go. I couldn't stop myself crying. Seeing how stoic she was throughout it all, it was an experience that changed my view of life.\n\nI gotta say, what a fucked up thing this cancer is, by the time you find out, it's too late. If you wonder why there's not much research to cure this cancer, it's because patients die too quickly or the diagnosis comes too late for in-depth scientific study to take place. Pancreatic Cancer is one of the top killers in the world. Maybe we should get someone like Bill Gates to raise awareness.\n\nAs to what causes it, no one fucking knows. You can eat right, exercise right and still get it. Mother nature is a bitch is all I can say. \n\nA doctor said to me, at the end of our days, if we didn't die of unnatural causes, four things will take us: cancer, pneumonia, heart attack and stroke. The only positive thing I can say is that with cancer, you get to say goodbye. To say I love you to your dear ones and to be at peace (hopefully) when you leave. \n\nCheers.",

        "body": "The specifics of staging vary slightly with each type of cancer, but generally stage 4 refers to cancer with established metastases. How sick a person feels / appears, and the chances of survival, vary significantly depending on the type of cancer.\n\nTo explain this, we need to remember what cancer is. A single cell somewhere in the body goes haywire, and starts rapidly and uncontrollably reproducing. The type of that original cell determines what sort of cancer you have. If it's a breast cell, you have breast cancer. If it's a bone cell, you have bone cancer. If it's a skin cell, you have skin cancer.\n\nAt first, the cells divide and reproduce at the site of the initial cell that went haywire. This forms a tumor. Depending on where this tumor is located in the body influences how easily it's noticed and what side effects it produces. With some cancers, the initial tumor typically isn't noticed unless it's caught by pure chance.\n\nAt a certain point, cells from the tumor will separate and spread through the body. How they spread depends on the type of cancer, but it can be through the lymph system, the blood, or directly through tissue. These cells will land in other parts of the body, and continue dividing, creating new tumors. These are the metastases. The side effects of a metastatic tumor, again, depend on where it is.\n\nWith cancers like pancreatic cancer, a person often seeks medical care for a symptom they think is relatively minor, only to find out that it's the result of having multiple tumors throughout their body. At the time, they seem relatively healthy and fine - but we've already reached a point where there's nothing that can be done.\n\nWhy?\n\nCancer sucks because it spreads exponentially. Every single cancer cell will divide into two new cancer cells. Different cancers do this at different rates, but it's generally very quickly. By the time a tumor goes from microscopic to macroscopic and able to cause symptoms, it can expand VERY rapidly. \n\nTo make matters worse, a person isn't \"cured\" from cancer until every single cancer cell is dead. Killing 99.9999% of their cancer will significantly extend their life, but if even one cell survives, it's no different than the single cancer cell that set the whole thing in motion.\n\nThe difficulty is killing these malfunctioning cells without also killing the regular cells that the body needs survive. Depending on the type of cell that turned cancerous, and the exact mutation, this can be easier or harder. Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery all focus on killing (or removing) cancer cells while leaving the healthy ones unaffected as much as possible. If the tumors are in the brain, for example, it can be extremely difficult to treat. Surgery is difficult to impossible, due to the potential damage to the brain. Chemotherapy can be significantly less effective due to the \"blood brain barrier\", with many drugs not being able to cross it. Radiation can be an option, but successfully killing 100.00% of the cancer (and not 99.9999%) while also not causing excessive damage can be difficult if not impossible.\n\nAs for how the person dies, well, the bigger the tumors, the faster they grow. The bigger a tumor, the more likely it will spread and additional tumors will start growing. They effectively take over the whole body, if the person survives long enough. Eventually, one of them disrupts something important. It could be in the brain. It could be with the heart. It could be in the body. Some people die relatively quickly as their brain is shut down, while others experience unimaginable agony as their bones break from the inside out from tumors. \n\nWe've made great progress, but there's still significant progress to be made, with some cancers being almost universally fatal by the time they're detected.

I'm not a professional/doctor, this is just the shit I read about cancer. \n\nAt this point, there are two kinds of cancers. One kind goes crazy and kills the host, the other kind has 1 main cancer that keeps the other cancers asleep(or in stasis), but still ends up killing the host. Either way, the patient is in pain. \n\nSo the doctor faces the following options:\n\n>Killing the big cancer, taking it out or by using radiation. This has a high chance of success as a surgery, but it won't stop the other cancers from erupting after - meaning that killing the main cancer will kill the host by turning 1 cancer into 8+. When this happens, it's usually a radiation nuke VS the cancers, so the doctor has to give enough radiation \"therapy\" to kill the cancers but not enough to kill the patient, and this is not always even possible. Result: host dies after or during surgery. \n\n>Chasing the metastasis: in other words, trying to kill the \"sleeping\" cancers and not the big one. There is no very good way of going about doing this: detecting all of them is often impossible at the moment, and killing them also damages whatever area in the body they inhabit. Also, the most common way to deal with these is radiation, which destroys the host's body. The end result is usually failure in killing all of the metastasized cancers, huge damage(and pain) to the host's body, and death by either the main cancer or the small ones erupting due to the main cancer ceasing to function/dying. Result: A lot of suffering, host dies.\n\n>Giving the patient a bunch of pain-killers so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. Result: Death. \n\nAnd one more horrible thing is left after all those low chances of survival: if one of the methods *did* end up working, if 1 cancer in stasis survives, the patient will have cancer *again*. So not only are the chances of survival shite, the chances of curing it are also fucking bad. \n\nTL;DR chances of surviving stage 4 cancer are shite. ",

[From this article...](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-early-detection-of-cancer-and-improved-survival-more-complicated-than-most-people-think/)\n\n>The bottom line is that the ever-earlier detection of many diseases, particularly cancer, is not necessarily an unalloyed good. As the detection threshold moves ever earlier in the course of a disease or abnormality (in the case of cancer, to ever smaller tumors all the way down to the level of clusters of cells), the apparent prevalence of the disease being screened for increases, and abnormalities that may never turn into the disease start to be detected at an increasing frequency. In other words, the signal-to-noise ratio falls precipitously. This has consequences. It leads, at the very minimum, to more testing and may lead us to treating abnormalities that may never result in disease that affects the patient, which at the very minimum leads to patient anxiety and at the very worst leads to treatments that put the patient at risk of complications and do the patient no good.\n\n&#x200B;",

Especially when you factor in quality of life considerations. <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-early-detection-of-cancer-and-improved-survival-more-complicated-than-most-people-think/\">From this article...</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bottom line is that the ever-earlier detection of many diseases, particularly cancer, is not necessarily an unalloyed good. As the detection threshold moves ever earlier in the course of a disease or abnormality (in the case of cancer, to ever smaller tumors all the way down to the level of clusters of cells), the apparent prevalence of the disease being screened for increases, and abnormalities that may never turn into the disease start to be detected at an increasing frequency. In other words, the signal-to-noise ratio falls precipitously. This has consequences. It leads, at the very minimum, to more testing and may lead us to treating abnormalities that may never result in disease that affects the patient, which at the very minimum leads to patient anxiety and at the very worst leads to treatments that put the patient at risk of complications and do the patient no good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div>",
