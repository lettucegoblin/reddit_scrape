Me, my mom and my step father went out to central london for the day (5 days before my bday). He took me to a place called denmark street which if you didnt know, is a street full of music shops. We went into this one place and on the wall were schecters as far as the eye can see. I'd always wanted to play one since I was around 11 years old or so.\n\nI'm sitting there jamming away on it with the biggest grin on my face my mom has ever seen. Step dad says its time we left and carried on with our day.\n\nWe walk out of the shop and he tells me, \"Cyrus, I forgot to get your new picks. Run back in the shop and grab some.\"\n\nSo I head back in the shop and the guy behind the counter just says \"screw the picks and take this instead.\" He hands me a hard case with the sign schecter on the side and I kinda just freeze. I open the box and inside is a card saying, \"Dear Cyrus. You are like the son I wish I had. You are an amazing man and you do alot for everyone without anyone ever needing to ask. This one is on me, Darren.\"\n\nThe Black and red striped synyster custom is in that box and its mine. I immediately break down in tears in the middle of the store and I'll be honest.

I can't speak for everyone, but as a teen I was a righteous jerk with an attitude that I was smarter than you, wiser than you, and that I wasn't going to let petty things bother me. This extended to my dad dying. I didn't even cry at the funeral. Sure, I was sad at times, but people die every day, my dad wasn't special, and I thought myself smart enough and self reliant enough to have a general attitude of \"who needs parents anyway?\" \n\nIn fact, I was smug enough to enjoy the advantages. I got social security checks every month, free money! People were extraordinarily kind to me. The school bent over backwards for me and I took every advantage. My dad died in May, and I didn't have to take any of my finals, was given an A on each one. My dad was a big football fan, and I told the coaches I wanted to be on the team for him. No problem! The \" in-crowd\" jocks I barely knew would call and invite me to come lift weights with them over the summer. I started getting invited to parties. Girls I thought were way out of my league were suddenly talking to me, telling me how great it was that I was doing this for my dad. I wan't doing it for my dad, I was doing it for attention. I actually fell in love with football, but thats just another benefit to the situation. The reaction was so overwhelmingly positive I told the basketball coach the same song and dance about how my dad always wished I was on the basketball team, \"No problem!\"\n\nI spent all summer thinking, yeah, it sucked that my dad had to die, but it was the best thing to ever happen to me! In fact, even looking back on it, my memories from that summer are still overwhelmingly positive. It was the first time I felt cool. First kiss. First time having a girlfriend, first time having sex! I had my dads car, which I was driving everywhere even before I had my license. Being a teenager suddenly didn't suck!\n\nThat attitude lasted all summer and through the first week of school. At the end of the first week. We had our first football game, away. It was an ok, experience, we lost, but I got to play a good bit and had fun. Something was wrong though. I didn't get the since of fulfillment that I expected and wasn't sure why. No matter. \n\nThe second game of the season was the first home game. I played a lot more and played well. I was a 2nd team LB, but made a great play early on and ended up playing with the first team the rest of the game. We won and it wasn't close. I was ecstatic, My teammates, coaches, hell, even cheerleaders where coming up telling me how great I did. Then as we were walking off the field I noticed something. My best friend on the team  was standing by the fence talking to his mom and dad about the game. I stopped in my tracks and looked around... Nearly all of my teammates were walking to the fence to meet their waiting parents, or were already there. I stood there for what seamed like forever, watching the looks of pride on parents faces, the back slaps, the hugs.\n\nI broke down and started crying. I literally collapsed down unto the field, put my head into my hands and bawled my eyes out. The sudden realization hit me that my dad was never going to get to see me play. He was never going to be proud of what I did or didnt do, was never going to be there for me to ask advice of. He was gone... forever. \n\nIn that moment I suddenly recalled with near perfect clarity all of the sacrifices my dad had made for me as a single parent. The long hours he worked. The way I always had new clothes and the toys and video games I wanted while my dad had nearly nothing for himself. I also recalled all the times I was terrible to him. All of the stupid, hurtful things I had said when we fought. Sitting there on that field I experienced possibly the worst moment of my life. The loss, the sadness, the anger at myself for the way I had acted when he was alive, for how I acted after his death.\n\nLosing a parent when young is devastating in ways we often cant appreciate while we are young.

He was my best friend who just happened to be my brother, I was his best man for his wedding and I had made plans for him to be mine. There's not really much I can say to make things better for you because quite frankly, nothing can make your situation better. All I can say is to 1) try to celebrate her life, try to focus on all of the good things she did for you and those around her. 2) Don't be afraid to talk to someone about what you're feeling. As a typical guy, I bottled up what I was feeling partly because I had to \"run\" my family because both of my parents were barely functioning and also because I'm a guy and I don't like talking about my feelings (still don't tbh). But bottling up your feelings can be dangerous, it ended up making me angry at everything. Sometimes I'll be in the shower and that's where I do a lot of thinking and I'll think about my brother and how he was killed before he could see his daughter and I just get so pissed off. You don't want to live like this, mad or upset or whatever. So if you feel like you're headed down this road then you need to find someone to talk to, even if it's someone like me, a total stranger from the internet. The third thing I would suggest to you would be to fall back on something you love, a passion. I'm a huge gearhead, I love everything about cars. The most relaxing thing I can do is hop in my car and go for a drive to blow off some steam. So if I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed I'll jump in my car and just head out to some back roads and bang out some gears. So I'm sorry that you're going through this, I don't wish it on anybody. It's easily the hardest thing we can go through and without support you end up feeling alone. I know that when my brother was killed people weren't really worried about me or my sister, all of the support went to his wife or my parents so my sister and I ended up feeling alone and left out. So if you feel like talking you can always message me. Just hang in there, it'll get easier.",

My brother and his entire squad were killed back in 2012 while training to deploy. Not a day goes by that he doesn't cross my mind. Sometimes it's about actually losing him but other times it's about the funny/stupid shit he would say or do but either way he crosses my mind every single day. He was one the most selfless people I ever knew, right beside my dad. I use my brother as inspiration on how to live my life. He was slow to anger and quick to laugh. He'd do anything for anyone. One thing that I heard a lot from guys in his squadron was that he always wanted to help out. He would routinely stay late to help out other guys with their work no matter how long it took. Even today, I stay in touch with a lot of the guys in his squadron and once a year, near the anniversary of their deaths, family members and Marines alike meet up in Washington D.C. at Arlington. We get together, visit the grave site, and then go to this local pub to share stories and drink in their honor. One thing I've learned, and it took me a while to learn this, is that you have to find any kind of positives out of a crappy situation. I know that because my brother was killed I have been able to meet a ton of great people and experience things I never would have. Now of course it doesn't make up for losing him but I believe you have to find any kind of good out of these types of situations and hold on to them.  ",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is how I describe it to people. It&#39;s a hole and nothing every fixes that hole, it&#39;s always there and always will be. You just learn how to live with it. My brother and his entire squad were killed back in 2012 while training to deploy. Not a day goes by that he doesn&#39;t cross my mind. Sometimes it&#39;s about actually losing him but other times it&#39;s about the funny/stupid shit he would say or do but either way he crosses my mind every single day. He was one the most selfless people I ever knew, right beside my dad. I use my brother as inspiration on how to live my life. He was slow to anger and quick to laugh. He&#39;d do anything for anyone. One thing that I heard a lot from guys in his squadron was that he always wanted to help out. He would routinely stay late to help out other guys with their work no matter how long it took. Even today, I stay in touch with a lot of the guys in his squadron and once a year, near the anniversary of their deaths, family members and Marines alike meet up in Washington D.C. at Arlington. We get together, visit the grave site, and then go to this local pub to share stories and drink in their honor. One thing I&#39;ve learned, and it took me a while to learn this, is that you have to find any kind of positives out of a crappy situation. I know that because my brother was killed I have been able to meet a ton of great people and experience things I never would have. Now of course it doesn&#39;t make up for losing him but I believe you have to find any kind of good out of these types of situations and hold on to them.  </p>\n</div>",
