        "body": "Over the past 48 hours I have discovered a wormhole into a soft-core pedophilia ring on Youtube. Youtube\u2019s recommended algorithm is facilitating pedophiles\u2019 ability to connect with each-other, trade contact info, and link to actual child pornography in the comments. I can consistently get access to it from vanilla, never-before-used Youtube accounts via innocuous videos in less than ten minutes, in sometimes less than five clicks. I have made a twenty Youtube video showing the process, and where there is video evidence that these videos are being monetized by big brands like McDonald\u2019s and Disney. \n\nThis is significant because Youtube\u2019s recommendation system is the main factor in determining what kind of content shows up in a user\u2019s feed. There is no direct information about how exactly the algorithm works, but in 2017 Youtube got caught in a controversy over something called \u201cElsagate,\u201d where they committed to implementing algorithms and policies to help battle child abuse on the platform. There was some awareness of these soft core pedophile rings as well at the time, with Youtubers making videos about the problem.\n\nI also have video evidence that some of the videos are being monetized. This is significant because Youtube got into very deep water two years ago over exploitative videos being monetized. This event was dubbed the \u201cAd-pocalypse.\u201d In my video I show several examples of adverts from big name brands like Lysol and Glad being played before videos where people are time-stamping in the comment section. I have the raw footage of these adverts being played on inappropriate videos, as well as a separate evidence video I\u2019m sending to news outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s clear nothing has changed. If anything, it appears Youtube\u2019s new algorithm is working in the pedophiles\u2019 favour. Once you enter into the \u201cwormhole,\u201d the only content available in the recommended sidebar is more soft core sexually-implicit material. Again, this is all covered in my video. \n\nOne of the consistent behaviours in the comments of these videos is people time-stamping sections of the video when the kids are in compromising positions. These comments are often the most upvoted posts on the video. Knowing this, we can deduce that Youtube is aware these videos exist and that pedophiles are watching them. I say this because one of their implemented policies, as reported in a blog post in 2017 by Youtube\u2019s vice president of product management Johanna Wright, is that \u201ccomments of this nature are abhorrent and we work ... to report illegal behaviour to law enforcement. Starting this week we will begin taking an even more aggressive stance by turning off all comments on videos of minors where we see these types of comments.\u201d*1* However, in the wormhole I still see countless users time-stamping and sharing social media info. A fair number of the videos in the wormhole have their comments disabled, which means Youtube\u2019s algorithm is detecting unusual behaviour. But that begs the question as to why Youtube, if it is detecting exploitative behaviour on a particular video, isn\u2019t having the video manually reviewed by a human and deleting the video outright. Given the age of some of the girls in the videos, a significant number of them are pre-pubescent, which is a clear violation of Youtube\u2019s minimum age policy of thirteen (and older in Europe and South America). I found one example of a video with a prepubescent girl who ends up topless mid way through the video. The thumbnail is her without a shirt on. This a video on Youtube, not unlisted, and \u00a0is openly available for anyone to see. I won't provide screenshots or a link, because I don't want to be implicated in some kind of wrongdoing. \n\nI want this issue to be brought to the surface. I want Youtube to be held accountable for this. It makes me sick that this is happening, that Youtube isn\u2019t being proactive in dealing with reports (I reported a channel and a user for child abuse, 60 hours later both are still online) and proactive with this issue in general. Youtube absolutely has the technology and the resources to be doing something about this. Instead of wasting resources auto-flagging videos where content creators \"use inappropriate language\" and cover \"controversial issues and sensitive events\" they should be detecting exploitative videos, deleting the content, and enforcing their established age restrictions. The fact that Youtubers were aware this was happening two years ago and it is still online leaves me speechless. I\u2019m not interested in clout or views here, I just want it to be reported. ",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Over the past 48 hours I have discovered a wormhole into a soft-core pedophilia ring on Youtube. Youtube\u2019s recommended algorithm is facilitating pedophiles\u2019 ability to connect with each-other, trade contact info, and link to actual child pornography in the comments. I can consistently get access to it from vanilla, never-before-used Youtube accounts via innocuous videos in less than ten minutes, in sometimes less than five clicks. I have made a twenty Youtube video showing the process, and where there is video evidence that these videos are being monetized by big brands like McDonald\u2019s and Disney. </p>\n\n<p>This is significant because Youtube\u2019s recommendation system is the main factor in determining what kind of content shows up in a user\u2019s feed. There is no direct information about how exactly the algorithm works, but in 2017 Youtube got caught in a controversy over something called \u201cElsagate,\u201d where they committed to implementing algorithms and policies to help battle child abuse on the platform. There was some awareness of these soft core pedophile rings as well at the time, with Youtubers making videos about the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I also have video evidence that some of the videos are being monetized. This is significant because Youtube got into very deep water two years ago over exploitative videos being monetized. This event was dubbed the \u201cAd-pocalypse.\u201d In my video I show several examples of adverts from big name brands like Lysol and Glad being played before videos where people are time-stamping in the comment section. I have the raw footage of these adverts being played on inappropriate videos, as well as a separate evidence video I\u2019m sending to news outlets.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s clear nothing has changed. If anything, it appears Youtube\u2019s new algorithm is working in the pedophiles\u2019 favour. Once you enter into the \u201cwormhole,\u201d the only content available in the recommended sidebar is more soft core sexually-implicit material. Again, this is all covered in my video. </p>\n\n<p>One of the consistent behaviours in the comments of these videos is people time-stamping sections of the video when the kids are in compromising positions. These comments are often the most upvoted posts on the video. Knowing this, we can deduce that Youtube is aware these videos exist and that pedophiles are watching them. I say this because one of their implemented policies, as reported in a blog post in 2017 by Youtube\u2019s vice president of product management Johanna Wright, is that \u201ccomments of this nature are abhorrent and we work ... to report illegal behaviour to law enforcement. Starting this week we will begin taking an even more aggressive stance by turning off all comments on videos of minors where we see these types of comments.\u201d<em>1</em> However, in the wormhole I still see countless users time-stamping and sharing social media info. A fair number of the videos in the wormhole have their comments disabled, which means Youtube\u2019s algorithm is detecting unusual behaviour. But that begs the question as to why Youtube, if it is detecting exploitative behaviour on a particular video, isn\u2019t having the video manually reviewed by a human and deleting the video outright. Given the age of some of the girls in the videos, a significant number of them are pre-pubescent, which is a clear violation of Youtube\u2019s minimum age policy of thirteen (and older in Europe and South America). I found one example of a video with a prepubescent girl who ends up topless mid way through the video. The thumbnail is her without a shirt on. This a video on Youtube, not unlisted, and \u00a0is openly available for anyone to see. I won&#39;t provide screenshots or a link, because I don&#39;t want to be implicated in some kind of wrongdoing. </p>\n\n<p>I want this issue to be brought to the surface. I want Youtube to be held accountable for this. It makes me sick that this is happening, that Youtube isn\u2019t being proactive in dealing with reports (I reported a channel and a user for child abuse, 60 hours later both are still online) and proactive with this issue in general.

One in ten children in Western countries, says the Council of Europe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince the previous Congress, in Japan in 2001, pedophilia on the Internet has grown and worries the people involved in this fight, like Queen Silvia of Sweden and its foundation, World Childhood: \"Internet is a fantastic instrument, but also dangerous she said, now that he is entering Third World countries. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrazil has just increased the controls and penalties for Internet pedophiles. A parliamentary committee had identified the accounts of 805 Orkut discussion portal subscribers where images of child pornography were accessible, forcing the Google Brasil server to denounce communities that offered banned material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the evolution of technologies facilitates the anonymous circulation of images, while mobile phones allow direct contact with a minor. Few people would be involved in this \"trade\", but Interpol has already listed 20,000 children used in pornography.

The struggle continues, the \"hell\" like Bangkok give way to a proliferation of destinations, the latest in fashion is Madagascar. The extraterritoriality law, which prosecutes abusive tourists where they live, has enabled rich countries to measure the extent of trauma in abused children.

        "body": "I see most of these comments expressing disgust watching these videos. I understand something is wrong here, but are we focusing on the right thing? \n\nYou're saying little kids playing in underwear is gross? Since when did it turn into a sexual thing? Do you think the same when you're at the beach? Look at kids and think of child porn? I hope not. I don't think it's the kids fault if they want to play around and upload videos. If no one made them to do it, they never could have even think about this being sexual at all.\n\nYouTube was accused for putting you in a pedophile wormhole. That's bullshit. It has an algorithm which gives you more of the videos you watched. Well of course if you have a new account and you only watched 2 videos, the algorithm has nothing to work with. Try this on you account and you won't get stuck into a \"wormhole\". The same phenomenon would happen with any other topic, not just kids in bikinis.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do think this whole thing is fucked up, and I the main source of it is the people who actually use the platform for their own sick pleasure. The people in comments are the verbal minority, who are definitely \"guilty\", and I'm sure there are even more silent one who just watch and enjoy.\n\nSo what's the solution here? I see everyone has a pitchfork ready, but no one has a viable answer. Should YouTube just not allow uploads from children? Seems like overkill. Ban the guys in the comments? Definitely would be a first step, but others can still view it. Maybe develop some algorithm which flags users who watch way too many of these videos. YouTube should definitely get involved and take a proactive step here.",

The general public is largely unaware of how this works and how difficult it is to implement safeguards against these problems.\n\nOn the one hand, tens of thousands of people are continually up in arms about YouTube demonitizing, unlisting and not recommending certain videos or channels because of its algorithms picking up content that is explicit, copyrighted or a violation of the ToS. Not a week goes by without a new social media storm about how channel X or video Y got caught up in one of youtube's filters. The platform isn't free enough and we need to find an alternative or get rid of all these restrictive algorithms on youtube, they say. \n\nOn the other hand, just as many (and often the same) people see videos like this and will immediately argue that the platform's filters don't even go nearly far enough. Violent cartoons aimed at kids, harmful conspiracy theories and anti-vax content, extremist political channels, children doing suggestive things... Youtube has been chastised for allowing this to spread and for not doing enough to stop it. \n\nTo clarify, I'm absolutely not saying there's anything wrong with either of these positions or that they're incompatible. But it's important people understand that this is a very fine line to walk and that it's difficult to strike a balance between recommending and supporting the \"right\" content while intensively moderating and restricting the \"wrong\" kind. A small flaw in either can easily result in a filter not picking up on inappropriate content and even suggesting it to people (\"the wormhole\" in the video), or it going too far by demonitizing or hiding solid videos dealing with controversial topics. I fully agree that youtube should stop the problem in this video, but we should be aware that automating that process in a more restrictive way can easily result in legitimate content (such as the initial videos of adult women doing the \"bikini haul\", or simply a video of someone with his daughter wearing a swimsuit) being hidden, demonitized or striked. And if that were to happen, we'd just see it as another scandal of how youtube's algorithms are crazy and hurt content creators, and that we should move to a less restrictive alternative (which in no time will face the same problems).

        "body": "I, like /u/PrettyFly4AGreenGuy, suspect part of the problem is that YouTube may not be using _quite_ the algorithm /u/Spork_the_dork described.  What they're talking about is an algorithm with the goal of recommending you videos which match your interests, but that's likely _not_ the YouTube algorithm's goal.  Rather, its goal is to maximize how much time you spend on YouTube (and therefore how much revenue you bring them).  A good first approximation of this is to do exactly what you'd expect a \"normal\" recommendation system to do: recommend you videos similar to the one's you already watch most (and are thus more likely to want to watch in the future.  But this _isn't_ the best way to maximize revenue for YouTube.  No, the best way is to turn you into an addict.\n\nThere are certain kinds of videos that seem to be popular with people who will spend huge amounts of time on the platform.  A prime example is conspiracy theories.  People who watch conspiracy videos will spend hours upon hours doing \"research\" on the internet, usually to the determent of the individuals grasp on reality (and by extension, the well being of society in general).  Taken as a whole, this is obviously bad, but from the algorithm's point of view this is a _success_, one which it wants to duplicate as much as possible.\n\nWith that goal in mind, it makes sense that the algorithm is more likely to recommend certain types of videos after you only watch one similar one than it is for others.  Once it sees a user show any interest in a topic it \"knows\" tends to attract  excessive use, it tries extra hard to get the user to watch more such videos, \"hoping\" you'll get hooked end up spending hours upon hours watching them.  And if you come out the other side convinced the world is run by lizard people, well, the algorithm doesn't care.\n\nIts not even exactly malicious.  There isn't necessarily anyone at YouTube who ever wanted this to happen.

What they&#39;re talking about is an algorithm with the goal of recommending you videos which match your interests, but that&#39;s likely <em>not</em> the YouTube algorithm&#39;s goal.  Rather, its goal is to maximize how much time you spend on YouTube (and therefore how much revenue you bring them).  A good first approximation of this is to do exactly what you&#39;d expect a &quot;normal&quot; recommendation system to do: recommend you videos similar to the one&#39;s you already watch most (and are thus more likely to want to watch in the future.
