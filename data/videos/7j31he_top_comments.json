However, until we expand on the metaphor we haven't learned anything and we can't apply the knowledge to our own lives.\n\nSo what does it mean when we say social media 'programs' us? Most people are satisfied with just saying something to the effect of 'psychology, dopamine, pavlov's dog's, reward systems, yadda yadda.' \n\nSure, that plays a part of it, but we need to expand even further, we need to be even more critical.\n\nMy suggestion is this: Interaction *hides protocol*. What does that mean? It means that all the colorful buttons and UI elements that make up a social media app *distract* the user from the fact that they are being instructed to follow *rules* and *protocols* of behavior.\n\nWhen facebook structures itself as an application, it has to decide how they are going to organize and structure the way we interact with each other. They give us rules, such as 'this is a status, this is a messenger box, this is your timeline, and you use them this way.'\n\nOf course, users always find a meta within the system, but the meta is never quite powerful enough to override protocol. \n\nAnd what protocol does is it begins as a simple rule, e.g., 'put text in this box, click this button, and then we will broadcast your message.' but then protocol, when it becomes adopted by a social structure, begins to shape and form behaviour.\n\nNow we spend lots of our time arguing, 'what's worth a status update? when is a private message appropiate? when is a group chat appropiate? what photographs from my vacation are worth sharing? what constitutes browsing, and what constitutes creeping?' And the list goes on and on, for each social media platform.\n\nEventually, all this constant discussion of *how to follow the rules the right way* eventually covers up the fact that we are following rules in the first place! eventually we begin to have a sense that we are 'liberated', 'connected', and 'communicating' through these platforms, when in reality our connections are strictly outlined and coerced, our liberation is actually a prison, and our communications are being shared as metadata by greedy companies all over the world.\n\nSo in short, I agree entirely with this article, but we really need to begin discussing these issues more critically.

Now that I'm in graduate school, I read a book for pleasure a month (we have a lot of reading in general.)\n\nI would highly encourage this. It doesn't matter how long you've gone without a book.

Get a book of short stories and go to a coffee shop, if you want to reinvigorate your love of reading. Kindles help too.</p>\n\n<p>When I was little, I read a book a day. When I got a Facebook, it did the same with my attention span, and I didn&#39;t care for a long period of time. Then I got a Kindle and got back into reading. First, I started with short stories, then longer ones, and I got back to a book a week. Now that I&#39;m in graduate school, I read a book for pleasure a month (we have a lot of reading in general.)</p>\n\n<p>I would highly encourage this. It doesn&#39;t matter how long you&#39;ve gone without a book. Tom Hanks wrote a really great short story book, so does Hemingway, Flannery O Connor, etc. You can even read books you read as a child, no one will care.</p>\n</div>",

I've never cared about upvotes or downvotes here.\"    \n\n/u/DanFreedse: \"12.5k points. I'm sorry but your hooked.. You will keep fishing for the next high\"    \n\n/u/dadeblunts: \"I disagree.

I don't use it for some narcissistic satisfaction\"\n\n*(pages and pages more like this)*\n\nTheir idea being that the \"short-form dopamine hits\" are *upvotes*.  \n\nI was referring more to the actual *content* of the site, as curated by millions of fellow dopamine junkies, which is basically an endless stream of very short hits of novelty/humor/outrage/etc. The average video on /r/videos is anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Longer stuff is rarer. Links to tweets, memes, and other very short, easily-consumed media is much more prevalent than links to long format media.\n\nIt's short attention span theater, the \"tl;dr\" version of the internet, perhaps because the Internet is so overwhelming in content that long format media represents too high an opportunity cost. So redditors feed on snippets, with the most upvoted content having the highest effort to reward ratio. Redditors have invented terms like [Wadsworth's constant](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-wadsworth-constant), referring to how much of a video can safely be skipped to save even more time.\n\nI'm a developer, and I find myself jumping to reddit most often when work is hard, frustrating, taking too long, etc. Reddit is an instant dopamine fix. Look at all those interesting links! Click on one, see something funny, click another, see something cool, click, click, click, one little dopamine hit after another, very little long-term engagement with anything and certainly no real effort required. It's also easy to justify just one more click. After all, they're all really short, right?\n\nWhatever else you can say about it, it's addictive. Like Pringles says \"Once you pop, you can't stop!\" A friend recently told me he changed his router to block reddit, just to try to stop compulsively typing \"reddit\" into his address bar.\n\nNote: if you made it this far, my guess is you're willing to read a longer comment than many redditors. \\*lol\\*  If you didn't make it this far, you proved my point, but you'll never know it. :)\n",

It&#39;s the fact that social media involves the creation of a personally selected subset of users, called friends, followers, or circle, etc. That&#39;s the distinguishing feature of social media in my book.</p>\n\n<p>Reddit is a collection of message boards distinguished from the generic boards that have been around for decades by the upvote system. You can subscribe to various boards. But you can&#39;t create your own little group of people that you interact with more or less exclusively. That&#39;s the difference between Reddit and social media like FB, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.</p>\n</div>",
