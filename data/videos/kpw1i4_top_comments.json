It's bullshit. This man died of Covid-19, just like thousands of other people _every single day_ in _just_ the US. The fact that you're trying to use his death as a fucking _learning opportunity_ - as if people struggling with obesity don't _constantly_ hear shit like that - is especially gross given the way people have been downplaying the pandemic, and how that has _led to this point_. \n\nIf Covid19 was an enemy combatant, the deadliest days in US war history would include _every day in the last week_. It is killing _everyone_. Yeah, overweight people are at higher risk of severe complications. _WE KNOW_. Trust me, _we've heard_. But when I hear shit like \"this dude didn't die of the virus, he died of being fat\", what I'm hearing is not just a complete disregard for the _actual cause of death_, but a tacit statement that we shouldn't be worried. We shouldn't be worried, because the people who die are people who are old, or fat, or disabled, and they were probably going to die anyways. \n\nFuck _that_ bullshit. I've been struggling with my weight my entire life, and you know what? That doesn't make my life worth _one goddamn ounce_ less worthy than yours. And if I die in this pandemic, it probably won't be because I'm overweight (hasn't killed me so far!). It'll be because I caught a deadly virus that was allowed to spread uncontrolled for _far_ too long. Just like this guy did. \n\nWhen you say things like this:\n\n> All young deaths are tragic, and I\u2019m touched by everyone\u2019s concern here. However, blaming COVID for this one seems a little far fetched, even if it was what eventually got to him. Make no mistake that this man was at a high risk of prematurely dying from diabetes, organ failure, cancer, etc. Sugar sentenced this man to dying young long before COVID came along.\n\nYou're saying that his death didn't matter. He was _already_ a dead man walking. Because he's overweight. Apply that same logic to grandparents, and it gets _really_ dark _really_ fast. \n\n> Yes, and if someone shoots your grandfather, blaming them for his death seems a little far-fetched.

I wanted to start a diet that let me eat some things that still feel like 'cheat foods'.  For anyone that doesn't know, keto is a very low carb diet. Cut out all bread, sugar, potatoes, rice, and other high carb foods. Your body chemistry changes, and you start burning fats (both as food, and stored in your body) instead of carbohydrates. I started at 321 lbs in February, and just weighed in at 239.8 this week. This shit WORKS. For inspirational posts and questions about the diet, I would encourage you to visit /r/keto and /r/ketorecipies",

I used an online TDEE calculator to figure out a rough estimate of my daily calorie budget to maintain my current weight, subtract 1000 from that number to get a budget for losing about 2lbs a week, and I use an app on my phone to keep track of everything. I just have to make sure I burn more calories than I consume, and ideally staying under the daily calorie budget. That was real easy 125lbs ago, but as the weight comes off, the calorie budget goes down too, and it\u2019s definitely getting trickier to stay under budget. Working out helps though, even if I consume a few more \u201cgross\u201d calories than the budget, what I burned by working out helps counter it so the total \u201cnet\u201d calories stay under budget. I\u2019m so familiar with the calories in what I typically eat now after almost a year of this, that I don\u2019t really have to be vigilant about counting every little calorie anymore, only when I eat something new.

Veins are kinda floppy, stretchy tubes that don\u2019t snap back the way arteries do, so they have valves, which is nifty, since those valves+skeletal muscle contraction (like just sitting there and squeezing your leg muscles for a few minutes) is enough to help push blood up against gravity back to the heart. It\u2019s your leg veins that you think about with DVT, since the that blood has the longest journey back to the heart but all you have to do is take a little walk every few hours, maybe try a standing desk, or kick your legs up for a bit if you\u2019re really really committed to not moving (which, you know, prob not the best life choice but sometimes you can\u2019t get up or you don\u2019t want to) is enough to keep your little booty safe!

As if we haven\u2019t been doing these for years already, how self important are we that we can\u2019t miss a year of birthdays or holidays? </p>\n\n<p>I get that it sucks, I miss people too. We did have a person over here or there, and of course intrusive family that can\u2019t take no for an answer comes over and we deal with it because it\u2019s easier than fighting, but honestly I\u2019ve been so vocal all year about why we want to be careful, and it\u2019s not insane to be cautious. I take umbrage to the shitty attitude we get for wanting to be safe. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t love you less because we don\u2019t wanna see you, actually we love you more cause we\u2019re protecting you as well as ourselves, so who\u2019s really the selfish one here?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m so sick of having the same conversations with family and the tone with my MIL is not great right now cause I told her we weren\u2019t going to a holiday gathering of any kind, and I also made a FB addressed to everyone and no one, saying (for the umpteenth time) that we\u2019re not doing holidays, birthdays, restaurants, parties, or any unnecessary gathering until covid is under control. </p>\n\n<p>She texted me saying she was embarrassed and mad that I put her on blast and I should have talked to her in private. Like, it wasn\u2019t addressed to her and if she\u2019s embarrassed by it then maybe she should be. She\u2019s clearly someone doing something wrong if she doesn\u2019t agree with what I said. How about stay in your house, stop going and seeing everyone, and don\u2019t go to the Bahamas or whatever? And don\u2019t act like we\u2019re selfish for protecting ourselves and working towards the greater good for our species by trying to take steps to prevent the spread of this insidious virus. Bloody Christ. </p>\n\n<p>And meanwhile my mom and step dad keep going to restaurants every week but then want me to come over and see them. They BOTH had covid earlier this year! What are they thinking??</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the rant lol I\u2019m just so mad about this shit. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re also dealing with ignorant people.</p>\n</div>",
