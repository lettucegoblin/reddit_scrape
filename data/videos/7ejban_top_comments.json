It provides businesses with the ability to compete in the global marketplace and is an engine of economic growth. Continued development of the internet and modern telecommunications, free of excessive and overly burdensome government regulations, is key to American innovation.\n \n> On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted 3-2 to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications utility under Title II of the Communications Act. The 332-page regulation was called \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d referencing the concept of preventing internet service providers (ISPs) from creating \u201cfast lanes\u201d and \u201cslow lanes\u201d for different content. This regulation effectively transferred power from ISPs to the federal government, and threatened to overregulate the Internet in a way that would make it more expensive for consumers, less innovative and less competitive. \n \n> On April 26, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to roll back the 2015 regulation. Chairman Pai is committed to an open and transparent process. As he explained, \u201ctwo years ago, the FCC hid the Title II Order from the American people until after it had been adopted. Only certain special interest groups were given special access able to make major changes to it. The FCC had to pass the 313-page Order before the public was allowed to see what was in it. The process over the coming months will be open and transparent with a nearly three month open comment period. You may agree or disagree with the proposal, but you\u2019ll be able to see exactly what it is.\u201d On May 18, 2017 the FCC voted to make the NPRM official. The comment period ended on August 30th, and the commission is expect to vote and issue a final decision on the rule. \n \n> I believe modernizing the 1996 Communications Act should be a top priority for Congress, and would clarify the FCC's role in the modern communications landscape. Congress must create level regulatory playing field that protects consumers and encourages innovation.  \n \n> It is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United States Senator.

I told them both in separate emails that I would love for them to fight for keeping the net neutral.\n\n**From Graham**\n\nThank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission's proposed rule, \"Restoring Internet Freedom.\" As the Senate considers net neutrality, I will keep your comments in mind.\n\nAs your United States Senator, my primary job is to understand and represent the interests of all South Carolinians. The opportunity to hear from you about the issues confronting our nation is not only essential to representative democracy, but allows me to better serve the people of South Carolina. We will not see eye-to-eye on every issue; however, I promise to always give your concerns the consideration they deserve.\n\nI encourage you to visit my website \u0097 http://lgraham.senate.gov \u0097 as it will have information on the most recent activities before the U.S. Senate. You can also sign up for our e-mail newsletter, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages which will provide the latest information and updates on the major issues facing our state and our nation.\n\nThank you again for contacting me. I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from you and am honored to have the opportunity to represent your interests in the U.S. Senate.\n\nSincerely, Lindsey O. Graham\n\n**From Scott**\n\nThank you for contacting me to express your thoughts on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its actions on the Open Internet Order. I am grateful for your input and the opportunity to address your concerns.\n\nAs you may know, in 2015 under the guidance of former Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC implemented what is known as the Open Internet Order. Under this framework, the FCC applied utility-style regulation to reclassify the Internet as a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under Title II of the Communications Act. This reclassification has allowed the FCC to impose stricter regulations on internet service providers (ISPs).\n\nUnder Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s guidance, the FCC has proposed its plan to restore market-based policies and go back to the light-touch regulatory oversight of the internet. The proposal, referred to as Restoring Internet Freedom, includes specific changes to roll back the current regulations. This includes returning the internet to its original classification as an \u201cinformation service,\u201d giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the authority to oversee the actions of ISPs, and clarifying that mobile broadband is not a commercial mobile service subject to strict regulations.\n\nThus far, the internet has experienced unprecedented growth as a result of freedom from oppressive government regulation. I support maintaining this environment so that it can continue to flourish.\n\nI certainly appreciate your input on the Federal Communications Commission and the opportunity to respond. Rest assured, I take internet access issues very seriously and would not support something that would restrict access to the internet for South Carolinians.\n\nAgain, thank you for sharing your perspective with me; I hope that you will continue to do so in the future. If I can ever be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me or a member of my staff.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTim Scott United States Senator\n",

These laws protect us from ISPs determining what content can be published on the Internet, how content is loaded based on your Internet package and so on. This initiative unfortunately only favors ISPs and not the American people or its representatives and public servants. **Please remember that you are indeed public servants, you serve the American people and not vice versa.**\n\n> I have been working for startups for 10+ years and repealing these laws would put startups at a serious disadvantage against large incumbents, effectively destroying any chances of the United States of America maintaining its dominance on technological innovation. If Net Neutrality laws are repealed, I would be forced to launch future startups I have plans on starting in other countries that place value and weight on Net Neutrality. \n\n> You have a choice to make. Contribute to the downfall of America where corporate greed prevails over doing what is right or make a stand against ISP lobbyers and protect the very people you were appointed to serve.\n\n**If we tie this to jobs, politicians will give a shit because it's the only thing that guarantees them votes (to either add jobs or stop jobs from being lost/shipped overseas).**\n\nHere are the email addresses for the FCC leadership (the first three are those who want to repeal, the last two do not want to repeal), let's flood their inboxes:\n\n**Ajit Pai, Chairman**\nAjit.Pai@fcc.gov\n\n**Michael O'Rielly, Commissioner**\nmike.o'rielly@fcc.gov\n\n**Brendan Carr, Commissioner**\nBrendan.Carr@fcc.gov\n\n**Mignon Clyburn, Commissioner**\nMignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov\n\n**Jessica Rosenworcel, Commissioner**\nJessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov\n\nGet active people!!!",
