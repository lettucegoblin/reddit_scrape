        "body": "If my sister's high school experience taught me anything, it's that the school board and superintendent are typically full of shit. \n\nSome background: my sister has always been an advocate for improving education for as long as I can remember. In high school she was elected as the student representative, and believe me, she was ready to make some change. She later found out that the student reps jobs was pretty much a joke for show. Yes, as the student rep, you were allowed to attend school board meetings, however you were expected to sit still and remain silent. She found out that the board was also a joke too, putting money in not where money was needed (teacher salaries was the big one, as most teachers could no longer afford to work in my state so they were moving to the sister state where they would be paid more, therefore our school of 1200 students was constantly understaffed and the part time substitutes running around from class to class.) The pay for teachers might have been shit but most teachers who stayed really did care about the students, and they adored my sister. Knowing about the current situation, my sister devised a plan. The SI was getting a raise that year while teacher salaries were getting a cut. My sister had spent weeks comparing his salary to the teachers salaries and came up with a plan that would give the teachers some money back, and the SI's salary would remain three times greater than the teachers salaries. Seemed like a win win. After all, if they could afford to remodel the football stadium for the second time in 4 years, they could afford this right? And they care about their employees too.... right? \n\nYea no. When my sister presented the plan in a board meeting, the board members shut her down, one of the members really disliked her and called her names after the fact, and made her cry. What grown adults do this to a kid? This was one of the many ideas she would bring to the board every week. Most of the ideas and changes were voted on by the student body, and she really tried to bring forth change, but she was always shut down.  \n\nIt felt like she was constantly dealing with sneaky, entitled children who never wanted to share. So this video here does not surprise me in the slightest.",

        "body": "This is a repost but I felt my experience last year was relevant to this.\n\n I began last year as an in school suspension supervisor for a local school not far from where I grew up. I thought it would be a great foot in the door position. I dealt with the worst of the worst all in hopes of getting a full time teaching position. I did this for a full school year at part-time pay, 30 hours a week.\n\nThe pay was decent enough for me to get my first apartment and I did so but I had no benefits or anything of the sort and still had to work part time at a local fast food chain to make ends meet and be independent.\n\nFast forward to this past year, another teacher was having medical issues and went on medical leave in early October with plans to retire at the end of the year. This was my chance, and they gave me the opportunity of teaching his classes. I did so without hesitation because this was what I thought I wanted to do. I had to come up with all my own lesson plans with some help from a few other teachers and teach 6 classes a day. The catch was I was still being paid part-time, had to come up with sub plans every friday (as I couldn't work more than 30 hours a week), and still had to work fast food to make ends meet. I did all of this from October to May. Long story short\n\n* My anxiety went through the roof\n* I dealt with insomnia for days on end\n* I lost at least 10 pounds\n* I cried way more than I ever thought I would\n* I couldn't take any sick days because I needed the money\n* I had no benefits, medical or dental\n* I had 0 free time\n\n\nSundays were by far the worst days, I would literally have panic attacks.\nI pushed on though, hoping I would achieve a full time position only to be informed this past February that the district was facing major cuts and they would not be replacing the teacher I was essentially full time subbing for. On top of this the administration consistently promised/told me that there would be other opportunities for me only to back out of those promises a few weeks later and this went on for the remainder of the year. I didn't know what I was gonna do as I needed the money so I kept pushing forward almost completely losing it around April.\n\nLet me be clear, I'm not looking for sympathy, I just want people to be aware of how hard it is for those in this profession. I ultimately left that school after being offered a \"half-time\" position last minute and am now a prison guard making over 50k a year. I'm disappointed that teaching didn't turn out to be what I thought it would be. I love my  new job, but I also feel guilty because of the relationships I built with my students and, somehow, I feel I abandoned them. It's nice running into them every once in a while and getting a \"I miss you, you were a good teacher.\" :/ \n\n**Teachers shouldn't be struggling. Financially, mentally, or emotionally.

I thought it would be a great foot in the door position. I dealt with the worst of the worst all in hopes of getting a full time teaching position. I did this for a full school year at part-time pay, 30 hours a week.</p>\n\n<p>The pay was decent enough for me to get my first apartment and I did so but I had no benefits or anything of the sort and still had to work part time at a local fast food chain to make ends meet and be independent.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to this past year, another teacher was having medical issues and went on medical leave in early October with plans to retire at the end of the year. This was my chance, and they gave me the opportunity of teaching his classes. I did so without hesitation because this was what I thought I wanted to do. I had to come up with all my own lesson plans with some help from a few other teachers and teach 6 classes a day. The catch was I was still being paid part-time, had to come up with sub plans every friday (as I couldn&#39;t work more than 30 hours a week), and still had to work fast food to make ends meet.

My wife no longer feels like a teacher she is just a data collector. She does assessment after assessment on kids so much so that she has to get help from the parents because there simply isn't a way for her to do them all.  They have no time for anything except to \"teach\" the shitty lesson plans they are given. These plans just \"teach\" kids how to do well on the three tests they take to see how well they are doing. This year her school started a policy where they must get all kids to grade level in reading. My wife had 5 kids at \"below first grade\" and 3 kids \"at first grade\" so she now has to focus on them so much that she struggles to challenge the higher readers, there is assistance available but that system will only take kids it knows it can help. If a child is to far behind  or a behavioral problem  then they won't give them help. Also the LD program has one teacher per building in  my wife's building that teacher is  responsible for 30+ children. Also die to time constraints they switched gym to once a week and now the kids only get one recess which is only 15 min after lunch. (I don't even want to start on the lunch and breakfast program, quick fact one of their most common meals has almost 40 grams of sugar in it.) Even if a teacher has the time to take the kids out they are not allowed to. This is just a few things of the many failings of our school system. My wife is a great teacher she has taken most of her kids up one grade level in thier worst subjects and has helped many troubled kids find their footing and succeed later on in school. What dose she get for this? Well is she is lucky she will get a $400 bonus and that's about it. She has her master's on top of a bachelor degree that takes five years to achieve. She has one awards and multiple acalades for her teaching. Guess what she gets? Nothing! She has not had a step raise in two years and probably won't get one. So what is this wonderful teacher doing on her off time? Job hunting. She is done she is burnt out and hates every second of her job. If we are in a financial position to we will be sending our child to a private school. The biggest reason is that this is all going to get a lot worse before it gets better and very soon only the lowest people will want to teach because they literally can't do anything else. America is doomed in my opinion because of this. If our school system is not funded and repaired properly it is going to implode and take our future generations with it. ",

My mentor teacher barely spoke to me except to throw me under the bus for not knowing the things she was supposed to be guiding me in. The interim principal (key word there being \"interim,\" he was trying to make everything seem hunky-dory so he could get the position permanently) basically bullied the hell out of me. I would go to him to ask for advice on issues I was having, he would tell me go away and read a chapter in a bullshit book he gave me instead. Sure, teaching books are great, but compared to in-person mentorship, it's so much worse. He would shame me, corner me in my own classroom, come in and sit down and observe and then leave without a word and never discuss it with me. And when I asked for help and support, I was written up for being \"belligerent,\" and that was the beginning of the end.\n\nThe school had so many discipline issues and fights that they were actually telling us to stop disciplining students because it was causing problems. A student under my mentor teacher cursed her out because she took his phone, he stormed out of the room punching lockers the whole way down. What happened? Next day he sat in my classroom, now my problem to deal with. Students destroyed my classroom decorations while I was out sick, and I was told to suck it up and let it go.\n\nSo 4 months after I got there, I ended up with a nervous breakdown and quit even before the end of the semester. I met one of my former students a couple months later who told me that the new teacher was awful, that she expected them to do research papers with barely any resources. \n\nHonestly, the only person there who treated me with any sort of decency was the freshmen principal, who I talked with a lot because I taught mostly freshmen. After I resigned he emailed me personally to apologize for my experience and tell me that I had done a great job despite all of the problems I faced. Last I heard, the interim principal lost the job and that freshmen principal became the new principal. I hope things are better there under his leadership. I won't go back to teaching. I don't think I can after that. It threw me into the worst depression I've ever experienced (and this is coming from someone who's dealt with it for over a third of my life). I now work a paperwork job that **makes far more money than I did as a teacher.** And that, really, is indicative of how we treat our teachers.",

Even if it was 1% and 99% that dog is still dangerous.</p>\n</div>",
