This is reminiscent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during World War II, and it is deeply disturbing to see such similar tactics being used again.\nThe Chinese government claims that these detentions are necessary for \"re-education\" purposes, but there is no doubt that they amount to nothing less than torture.

The horses in our backyard were not inside their stables. They were running around freely in the snow, enjoying the winter wonderland.\nAt first, I thought it was odd, but then I realized that it was actually a good thing. Horses love to run free, and what better time to do so than when there's fresh snow on the ground?\nSo I went outside with some hay and carrots for the horses, and they greeted me with their friendly neighs.
