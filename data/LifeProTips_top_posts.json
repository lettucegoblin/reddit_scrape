When I got up and saw that I missed it, I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses, in the hope that maybe, just maybe, they'd be understanding and give me another chance. \n\nInstead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. \n\nThey replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?\n\nDon't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.\n\n\nEdit: I still get notifications when people comment.\nKeep them coming, I'm glad I've helped you out :)",
