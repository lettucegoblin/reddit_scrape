My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one.

That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers.",

Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80&#39;s. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers.</p>\n</div>",

EA Games is quickly driving the Star Wars intellectual property off a high cliff with their shady business practices.

It seems like a blatant cash grab in a premium title for home consoles. There's already been a backlash of millions of gamers against the game on the popular web community, Reddit.com.

I love Disney and I love all that Disney represents. My grandparents love to recount how they were the first people to ride Space Mountain, which didn't even have seatbelts at the time. My grandma screamed so much she lost her voice and the park employees thought she had fallen off the ride. I feel a very real connection to your company. On top of that I am a die hard Star Wars fan and so far love everything you have done with the title, from The Force Awakens, to Rebels.\nSo imagine my dismay at what is happening with Battlefront II. It is worse than gambling because games like this will eventually be in the hands of children, but it's more than that. I bought Battlefront I and I felt like a buffoon for doing so. The game was beautiful and so perfectly crafted, but it felt so... dead... Like it has no soul. Like a Lamborghini without an engine. A beautiful woman with the personality of a wet fish. The game was nothing more than a cash grab, and it hurt more than losing the 60 dollars to pay for it.\n\nDisney, this isn't you. The detail and love you pumped into my all time favorite IP belies the fact that you CARE. You aren't looking for a cash grab, you want a quality product. This game will usher in a new generation of gamers, do you really want them all cursing your name? Do you really want them accepting gambling in video games as the norm?\n\nEverything I know about your company has convinced me otherwise, please don't let EA do this to a beloved franchise. You're better than that. You've done such great things, don't let this besmirch your good name. It's not too late to turn it around somehow. I believe in you. If you do something about this, imagine the loyalty and trust you'll gain instantly. This is your chance to enfranchise a multitude and gain more die hard supporters.\n\nDo the right thing, \nTwothumbs \n",
