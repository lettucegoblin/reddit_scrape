The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.\n\nThe Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now.

It's actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the \"spiritual warfare\" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people's behavior. A good example of this is in the novel \"This Present Darkness\" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation's Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.\n\nIt's really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It's not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.\n\nJust posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases.
