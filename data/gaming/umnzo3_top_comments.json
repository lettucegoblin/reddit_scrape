A couple days later he still barely was eating so we took him in.  Stayed for a couple hours and the vet recommended we go home as they felt it wasn't that serious but they needed to run some tests as they didn't know what was wrong but he was anemic and dehydrated - the tests would take some time so we went home expecting to pick him up later with a prescription or something.  This was around 10am.\n\nAt 2pm I got a call from the vet - they suspected a puncture in his intestine and recommended exploratory surgery immediately as they suspected he had turned septic and things were going downhill quickly and they needed to act.\n\nWe were rushing to be with our boy when at 2:34 we received the call that they couldn't save him, he was suffering and we needed to end it.  I asked if we could please be there when it happened...the vet said:\n\n\"He's asleep now and not in pain; if you were to see him, we'd need to wake him up - which at best he would just be confused and scared and possible in pain as we said our goodbyes - so I recommend, for his sake, we put him down and we do it right now; you won't be able to say goodbye - he will have passed by the time you arrive\"\n\nSo we told them it was ok, let him go, but please someone be there with him.
