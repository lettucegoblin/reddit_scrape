        "body": "Same! We had two custodians at my elementary school and everyone loved them. \n\nOne time when I was a junior in high school, me and a friend were skateboarding in that same elementary school around 8pm. We were filming for a short video we were working on. We ended up running into one of those custodians who remembered both of us, including my friends name. We shot the shit and talked about what we were up to and asked him about the school. He let us finish skating and then around 9:30pm when he was locking up, he found us and warned us that there were police outside the front gates who were waiting for him to lock up so they could catch us for trespassing. He told us which fence to jump over near the back of the school and got us off the hook. He was such a homie. \n\nEDIT: Full story about our escape from the cops because it seems like people are interested. \n\nSo he pointed us to this specific area of the back fence which led out into a culdesac. We went back there, but we quickly noticed that we were silhouetted against streetlights, and that the 2-3 squad cars in front of the school would easily spot us climbing the fence from across the field. They were also scanning the field with their spotlights. \n\nAt that point we were freaking out and started trying to think about anyone we know who lived in one of the houses bordering the school field. We remembered a friend who lived in one of those houses and called him to see if we could jump into his backyard. As we were crouched near the edge of the field while on the phone with our friend, we started to see the cops walking through the school towards us with their flashlights. At this point we didn't stop to think why 2-3 squad cars would be there for some kids skating, but we were so hopped up on adrenaline it didn't matter.\n\nJust as our friend picked up we basically told him \"hey, we're jumping into your backyard right now to get away from these cops in [school name].\" He said it was okay, so we threw our skateboards over the fence into his back yard and scaled the wall just as the cops reached the area of the field we were in. We were in a pretty dark area at the back of the field so they probably couldn't see us from that distance. I couldn't see shit when I jumped down the other side of the wall so I ended up twisting my ankle on the landing pretty bad, but I couldn't really feel it because adrenaline. \n\nWe ran out the side gate of his house into his front yard and just started hauling ass on our skateboards down the street. As we got to the first intersection which led to the street where we saw the cop cars parked out front, we got off our skateboards to peek around. Just then, we saw another two squad cars round the corner near the school coming straight towards us. We turned around a laid prone in some bushes in someone's front yard. We saw their spotlights shine over the top of the bushes as they drove by. After they passed, we checked to make sure there were no more cops, crossed the intersection, and skated like our lives depended on it back to my friends house. \n\nAfter relaxing in his living room for a bit, his step-dad got back home from wherever he was. He jokingly says, \"Jesus what the fuck did you guys do? There's cops all over the neighborhood.\" We looked at each other and explained everything that just happened. He was just like \"Goddamn you boys are lucky you got away.\" He asked why so many cops would be looking for two kids just for skating and we had no fucking clue. But his step-dad was involved in some shady shit too so he was definitely not eager to get the cops involved in anything. He told us to just stay inside. \n\nIn the morning we found out that a bank had been robbed down the street from the school that night, around the same time we were skating in the school. So we think that the cops thought we were the robbers trying to escape/lay low in the school until things cooled down or something. Either way, we're lucky things turned out the way they did. We were stupid for running like we did, but we were just your average 16-year-old punk skater kids. Makes for a good story to tell nowadays though. \n",

We got to be his Stock Boys by basically wheeling the trash can around during lunch, emptying it, and wiping down lunch tables. When we weren&#39;t doing that we got to hang out on the loading dock overlooking the playground and hang out. Kids weren&#39;t allowed near the loading dock during recess, so that made us seem extra cool. On Fridays, Chuck would bring us milkshakes.

[This little 5'2\" Italian grandma named Mildred.](https://i.imgur.com/DfODZhB.jpg) She was very nice to us from what I remember but I also remember that we all knew, even at 6-7 years old, that that rag was fucking disgusting. Some kids used to get really upset and yell at her and even cry and she'd just laugh and laugh. It was nearly impossible to get any sort of retribution. It was like she was too old and too cute of an old lady to even be implicated for anything.\n\nAlso, Mildred has got to be one of the strangest females names I've ever heard and I've never met another one since nor even heard of one -- does anyone know any Mildreds from their lifetime? I had to look it up to make sure she wasn't one of those kids whose parents wished they had a boy but sure enough:\n\n> Mildred is a female given name. It is an Anglo-Saxon name of Old English origin, and its meaning is \"gentle strength\".\n\nI find that name sort of ironic... but yeah, sorry to blow up your spot, Mildred, but you were old as shit back then and I'm sad to say you may not be with us any longer. Sorry to air out your dirty rag laundry but that rag was cold and I was the recipient of your tricks many o' times...",

Some kids used to get really upset and yell at her and even cry and she&#39;d just laugh and laugh. It was nearly impossible to get any sort of retribution. It was like she was too old and too cute of an old lady to even be implicated for anything.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Mildred has got to be one of the strangest females names I&#39;ve ever heard and I&#39;ve never met another one since nor even heard of one -- does anyone know any Mildreds from their lifetime?
