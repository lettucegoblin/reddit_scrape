Japan is for people from Japan, Korea is for Koreans, etc etc. But how do you define 'Chinese' when you don't have a singular ethnicity?\n\nWell normally culture, language and/or religion helps. Thing is China has variety of those as well.\n\nSo way back when they wanted this 'unified' China against all those imperialists, capitalist, foreign interventions etc etc they pushed this idea that China is one nation..and Chinese as people who live on the land (not by their actual history or culture etc)\n\nThen the problem with the USSR collapse and several smaller states becoming independent. So what would happen to 'China' if all these ethnic minorities wanted independence like former USSR satellite states?\n\nWell, since 'Chinese' is people livining in 'China', they justified the government with twisted history (there's whole different practices of china altering/destroying historical sites/relics) to say every one of these ethnicity was 'part of China' at one point or other in its history. To put it simply, rather than to actually unifiy it's ethnicity voluntarily they brainwash and/or use force. Like in this post\n\nThis is just one of those things that happen. Look up Tibet. Not much different. People have been voicing their concerns literally for decades. (Free Tibet). Similar shit happened between China and  (South )Korea and there was tension back few years ago (iirc that's when Trump visited China).\n\nAll to justify the Chinese government rule..and to stomp out ant movement for independence.\n\nIt gets complicated, but this is as simple as I can condense)\n\nEdit: just pointing out that first part of this post about Korea and Japan are examples...cuz people keep pointing this out. I'm aware of Japanese minority. Im aware that Japanese gov has been promoting themselves as homogenous at least till 80's.\n\nI'm just explaining thought process behind why this is happening not what other countries are doing. Hence following paragraphs about what 'Chinese' means to CCP and what they are doing to ensure that everyone is 'Chinese'.\n\nAlso, while I am grateful for your awards, please don't waste any money.

(And &#39;gypsies&#39;)\nDoes anyone know if these &#39;gypsies&#39; got any apologies or reparations out of Germany like the Jews??? Yeah thought so.</p>\n\n<p>PS : other redditer just saying cuz of money and shit...it&#39;s not that simple.</p>\n</div>",

While this is a bit of an Europocentric approach, the history of the last three decades meant that a lot of the political institutions developed in Europe at the time got exported to the rest of the world, with significant regional variations, but nonetheless.\n\nAt the time Europe was rocked by a massive conflict called the 30 year war. I don't know how familiar you are with it but to put it bluntly, Europeans started to  harness the incredible power of gunpowder and efficient administrative political entities for military destruction on a never before seen scale, in reality only the devastation of the world wars came close, nearly 300 years later. On average German states lost between 20-40% of their entire populations, with some losing 3/4 of their people to war, disease and famine.\n\nThe general reason for the war (although there were many economic and political factors that caused it) was the religious differences between the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. It was basically an attempt by half of the princes to influence internal affairs (and change the religion) of the other half, to oversimplify a little. \n\nThe problem was that although some external powers like France, Sweden and even the Turks intervened at times, nobody could really achieve superiority. What ended up happening is that humanity for the first time saw the glimpse of what total war in the modern world would look like, no real winner and lots and lots of losers.\n\nSo at the peace conference in Westphalia, after years of exhausting warfare and sometimes outright genocide,  they decided that states simply cannot be allowed to freely intervene in internal affairs of their neighbours. The many differences would just mean unending warfare and conflict, as they had seen for the last 30 years. What they decided, was that from now on for the parties involved the principle of Cuius regio Ius religio (He who reings decides the religion) would apply. It was no longer permisible to declare war, because of a difference in faith (of course muslims were still satanic heathens etc. but I digress).\n\nThis was the first limitation of the so called Ius ad Bellum (right to war) and it came to shape the way we think about international relations today. Basically the problem with intervening in China because of the Uighur camps is, that it would be hard to say why China should not intervene in the USA because of Guantanamo. This would quickly escalate into a tit for tat and general bad things happening.\n\nNow obviously this system has a major problem and that is gross abuse of human rights. That's why the international community has been trying to develop a principle called R2P (responsibility to protect). Again I will simplify this a little, but the gist is that while every country is sovereign and cannot be intruded upon, there are a couple of basic responsibilities everyone needs to ensure for it's citizens. If you fail to provide them (such as your citizens not being genocided) the international community has a responsibility to act and intervene.  \n\n\nNow obviously this principle is not perfect and it's use is so far limited. But Libya was the first intervention where R2P was specifically used and invoked to legitimize action. The problem is that all the diplomacy and principles need to take real hard power into account and China has lots of that stuff.",

        "body": "Thank you, that's very kind of you!\n\nI wish I had better news to report than *all of the options are undesirable*, but at the very least people ought to be aware of the details. A lot of these companies will broadcast that they're 'locally owned!' or 'locally designed', while hiding in the small print that they outsource all of the production to China. That's their choice, but it does feel a little deceptive.\n\nAlso, I've just seen the edit you made to your previous comment, and I regret to inform that I also did a research dive into reusable toilet paper options. Even if one can overcome the unpleasantness of the concept, there were a few experts [outlining the dangers of contamination](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/15/reusable-toilet-paper-why-one-germ-expert-draws-line-bathroom-cloths/430055002/) (even if you were only to use these options for urine, and not feces. Apologies for the TMI there.) That was enough to rule it out for me, as I don't feel comfortable risking my health in order to try and support the environment.\n\nA bidet seems to be another option, but unfortunately it's not possible in my area. Bidets are illegal due to contamination risk from backflow into the water pipes. If they are installed it must be specifically certified bidets, installed by a professional plumber, and your toilet must be registered. The idea of registering my toilet is...an interesting thought. However, for many people in other parts of the world, they can be purchased cheap and DIY installed. Not sure about the practicality of teaching children to use a bidet, though!\n\nIn the end, I came to the conclusion that it's one of those scenarios where you do the best you can for your own situation. If that means cheap toilet paper, plastic wrapped toilet paper, or chinese-made toilet paper, that's not a reflection upon you. It just further shows that a consumer is often backed into a corner between caring about the environment/ethics of what they need to buy, and what they can safely afford.

A lot of these companies will broadcast that they&#39;re &#39;locally owned!&#39; or &#39;locally designed&#39;, while hiding in the small print that they outsource all of the production to China. That&#39;s their choice, but it does feel a little deceptive.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I&#39;ve just seen the edit you made to your previous comment, and I regret to inform that I also did a research dive into reusable toilet paper options. Even if one can overcome the unpleasantness of the concept, there were a few experts <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/15/reusable-toilet-paper-why-one-germ-expert-draws-line-bathroom-cloths/430055002/\">outlining the dangers of contamination</a> (even if you were only to use these options for urine, and not feces. Apologies for the TMI there.) That was enough to rule it out for me, as I don&#39;t feel comfortable risking my health in order to try and support the environment.</p>\n\n<p>A bidet seems to be another option, but unfortunately it&#39;s not possible in my area. Bidets are illegal due to contamination risk from backflow into the water pipes. If they are installed it must be specifically certified bidets, installed by a professional plumber, and your toilet must be registered. The idea of registering my toilet is...an interesting thought. However, for many people in other parts of the world, they can be purchased cheap and DIY installed. Not sure about the practicality of teaching children to use a bidet, though!</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I came to the conclusion that it&#39;s one of those scenarios where you do the best you can for your own situation. If that means cheap toilet paper, plastic wrapped toilet paper, or chinese-made toilet paper, that&#39;s not a reflection upon you. It just further shows that a consumer is often backed into a corner between caring about the environment/ethics of what they need to buy, and what they can safely afford. I hope that you are able to find a solution that works for you (and your family!)</p>\n</div>",
