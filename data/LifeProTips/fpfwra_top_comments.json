She taught gifted students and special needs students during her 30+ years.  My siblings, her other grandchildren, and myself included were all reading around the age of 2-3 years old.  My sister is 8 years younger than me and I still remember how amazing it was watching my grandmother work with her.  \n\nMy grandmother had 5 kids and as of now has 10 grandchildren.  My uncles and aunts all have at least a bachelors degree in something.  Most of her grandchildren (at least the ones of age) have some sort of college degree.  \n\nShe was so very patient with us and had a knack for picking out books for us to read that she knew we would like based on our interests as kids (which i think is very important to help kids become early readers).  I remember as a kid she heard me talking about the video game Halo: CE when it came out on original xbox.  She remembered that a year later and got me one the older halo novels (cant remember which).  That book happened to be my first sci-fi novel and sparked my love for sci-fi books.  \n\nSince i was a kid and still to this day there really hasn't been a time where i wasn't reading some sort of book.  \n\nThroughout my life i've met people that love to read and those that despise it.  Most people i've met that enjoy reading usually seem more intelligent and more effective problem solvers.  \n\nI hope and pray that my grandmother is still alive when i have children so they can experience her knowledge and love of learning like i did.",

Then of course the expected &quot;book, mama&quot; as I would point to books. </p>\n\n<p>She tells me that by the time I was a year old I was saying 3-4 word sentences. \n&quot;Basically, you started talking at 3 months and haven&#39;t shut up since.&quot; She likes to tease. </p>\n\n<p>I was a very sick child though, so I couldn&#39;t really walk until about 2 years old, so I guess it was a trade off? <em>shrug</em></p>\n\n<p>I could read and write before kindergarten because mom spent all day with me, teaching me, and was practicing my cursive during classes while others were practicing their ABCs. My teacher did force me to write right handed when I was a lefty though, but it was the 90s, I guess it was still a thing back then.</p>\n</div>",

As a parent of a profoundly dyslexic child, I don\u2019t think forcing the mechanics of reading early is always possible and can make it a miserable experience for the kiddo if they have a disability. We used audiobooks and read to our kiddo constantly so she would love books and not hate the process until we could get her proper instruction. She is a freshman in HS now and in honors English, and loves books even though she had virtually no orthographic processing, working memory, or phonemic awareness.\n\nAlso it helps that her dad and I read quite a lot ourselves.",

My daughter is only 2 and a half but already the activities we do together are all about learning and problem solving (sometimes to my detriment haha).\n\nFor example: We play the \"floor is lava\" and we have to get from one couch to the other by throwing pillows on the floor. After a few times of doing this I only gave her 2 pillows and asked her to do it and she of course had no idea. I then showed her she could stand on one pillow, grab the one behind her and place it in front, then walk on that pillow and repeat to get across.\n\nWe read books together, but I also tell her stories and I ask her questions about what should happen in the story, what characters are there or what they are doing. She loves it. And sometimes I ask her to tell me a story. It's usually incredibly short and only a few sentences, but it's great seeing her do her best to imitate our story telling process to me.\n\nOne of the last things I do is reiterate everything we went over. For our story games at the end of the story her character usually tells me and her mom (in the story) everything that happened once more. When I show her how to do simple things I will show her how it doesn't work and then how it works again.\n\nAll of these things (I think as a completely biased party) really help her grow cognitively and both her and I have a great time doing it.",
