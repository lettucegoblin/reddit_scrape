I woke up, didn\u2019t shower, shave, or get dressed, and dialed in. No one was there. They called asking where I was and I said I was waiting on the line but no one else was on. They said it should have been updated and I was supposed to come in. They asked how fast I could get over to do an in person interview and I said 30 minutes. I showed up but didn\u2019t shave and the older owner was like \u201cthis is how you show up to an interview, with jeans and not shaven?\u201d My suit was being dry cleaned. They asked how fast I could get there, not how long it would take. I\u2019m a programmer so it\u2019s pretty irrelevant anyways but I was like \u201cyeah, I didn\u2019t have time because you didn\u2019t update the meeting and it is what it is.\u201d Got hires but knew I\u2019d continue to look for jobs anyways since that\u2019s not a place I\u2019d ever work in my life after being called out like that for their mistake and trying to accommodate them.</p>\n</div>",

Guy missed the interview and asked to reschedule with no explanation.</p>\n\n<p>I just rejected him. If he had a good reason I&#39;d have made an exception but not for no reason.  Another person messaged me and said they were running late because they were having trouble getting their toddler napping about 2 min after the interview was supposed to start and I said no problem and we pushed it to when they were supposed too.</p>\n\n<p>One person communicated the issue and the other left me to assume he had no valid reason.  I&#39;m give my employees a lot of freedom to work. Why would I ever trust someone who won&#39;t communicate or admit fault.</p>\n</div>",
