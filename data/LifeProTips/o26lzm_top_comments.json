I kept hitting tab to make sure it caught all the fields, and then started doing my job when it cycled back to the first field.\n\nafter my second day of work, I got called in to my bosses' office, who informed me that I was being terminated for not taking the job seriously, and potentially causing hours of work to correct people's tax information.

I know I double checked everything.\"\n\nhe grumbled about it and said I was wasting his time, but, he relented and pulled one up. his finger went right down onto that fucking down arrow key, and it took him about ten minutes to complete reviewing the form. \"Well, this one is fine, but...\"\n\nI interrupted with, \"can you pull a new form, so I can show you how I do these?\"\n\nhe was really off guard by this point, but, he pulled up a new document on his computer and stood up, so I could sit. I didn't even sit - I leaned over, hit tab about fifteen times, made a couple corrections, and marked the now corrected form as complete in just over a minute.\n\nafter a pause, dude asked, \"...who trained you to do that?\" I answered, \"no one; the Tab key has done that exact same thing since before Windows was made.\"\n\nhe stewed it over for a little bit, shook his head, and said, \"...no, that's not okay. you weren't approved to do this, and you've likely ruined dozens of people's tax forms. the man hours we'll need just to fix your mistakes is bad enough; I can't trust that you're taking this job seriously, and that's unacceptable in this line of work.\"\n\nfucking boomers, man. there were dozens of people there making a damn fine wage and getting great benefits from the state, and they literally spent the majority of their work day holding down a fucking arrow key. what a scam.",

(I imagine there is some overlap.) The rules are mostly uniform across the country, but there can be some variances by state. \n\nThe first thing that came to my mind is that in California, an attorney may not charge a legal fee that is disproportionate to the actual work performed. From this, it should be clear that an attorney cannot charge a legal fee for time during which no legal work was performed.  (There are additional violations, but this is a core example.) Most attorneys billing on time will have software that automatically tracks and charges client phone time in 6 or 10 minute increments, but this can be adjusted/stopped easily, so there\u2019s really no excuse. I don\u2019t normally bill for time, but I also don\u2019t see the point of anyone doing this with the intention of gouging his/her own client, since there are plenty of other billable tasks\u2014recordkeeping, doc review, research, follow-up\u2014that simply have to be entrusted to the honesty and integrity of the attorney. To simply bill for chit-chat is not only highly inappropriate, but also the worst way to gouge your own client since it\u2019s the one area where the client has oversight.  Something tells me this is simply the neglect/arrogance of an attorney who simply thinks he lives and breathes under an entitlement to bill at X-hundred dollars an hr. \n\nUnfortunately, the rules of professional conduct allow for complaints against attys for ethical violations, but there is very little that can be done under the rules to actually \u201cright\u201d this kind of economic wrong. HOWEVER, I also just learned (while checking up the actual language of the rules to write this out) that in California an atty cannot charge an \u201cunconscionable\u201d legal fee, as opposed to the more widespread standard of \u201cunreasonable\u201d legal fee. (I would have assumed it was unreasonable.)  The reason the California State Bar implemented the higher ethical standard is not to try to shield attorney misconduct, but because attorneys are subject to the same broad consumer protection laws as other professional services. In other words, a client may simply sue under California law (typically for restitution) for unreasonable atty charges, assuming it makes economic sense to do. A state bar complaint for violating the rules of professional responsibility could be warranted in addition to and separate from any lawsuit, if the legal fees charged are unconscionable in proportion to the actual legal services performed.

I'm a baker in a food production facility, and, we have something like twenty commercial-sized ovens, each large enough to fit a full rolling rack and keep it spinning. you might imagine that we make a lot of baked goods.\n\nanywho, when I started, the person who trained me pointed out that half the ovens were newer, because they'd been installed after an expansion some years back. they were made by the same company, but, the updated version swapped out the analog time and temperature controls for a built-in tablet. the guy then shows me a logbook with every single unique item we produce in it, and tells me that *this* book provides the correct times and temperatures for baking anything in the newer ovens, and many of the products had a different time or temp for *each individual* new oven.\n\nto give you an example, one cookie bakes at 400\u00b0F for 11 minutes in any of the ten older ovens. no muss, no fuss. but, if you wanted to do that same cookie in any of the new ovens, the logbook indicates that six of the new ovens will give you the same result at 360\u00b0F for 11 minutes, while four of those ovens would need to be set at 375\u00b0 for 10 minutes. oh, and when I say \"six of the new ovens,\" I don't mean \"those six in a row,\" I mean going down the line like, \"this one, not this one, this one, not these two, these three, not this one, and then this one.\"\n\nas you can imagine, I immediately had questions, because nothing I just told you makes any fucking sense, right? see, we get a daily baker sheet that tells us everything we're baking each day, and it *already includes* the official time and temperature for each item. why not just... go by that?\n\nwell, the answer I got was that the new ovens weren't true to temperature - they were hotter than indicated - and all the bakers were constantly burning product when they first got the ovens. so, a bunch of the managers and supervisors in kitchen decided to use trial and error during downtime to figure out what to set each new oven at, ***per product***, just to have product come out the same as it does from the old ovens. I want to add that we have goddamned **hundreds** of different baked goods we rotate through, and *every* **single** ***one*** of them is in that fucking logbook, **up to ten times each**. it is truly a goddamned marvel of man hours spent. I've been told that if you couldn't find a product in that book, we weren't allowed to bake it in the new ovens for \"quality assurance\" reasons.\n\nI asked why we didn't calibrate the ovens to make sure they were true to the displayed temperature, and I was told that no one had access to the maintenance mode on the new tablet interface because no one knows or remembered the password, so, we just couldn't do that. again, a pretty shitty answer - apparently, over several years, no one has thought to call the fucking company they bought commercial equipment from to ask for assistance with the issue.\n\nmonths later, after I'd gotten promoted and was running the bake room myself on my shift, I had a sudden suspicion cross my mind - what if the book was all a bunch of fucking bullshit? sure, it was a bit of a tin foil hat moment, but, it stuck with me. see, I'd bumped into bakers from the other shifts, and they struck me as being lazy as hell. just a bunch of older guys sauntering around and half-assing their shift and giving me a shitty attitude when I clock in - but, I'm not exaggerating in any way when I say I can do the work of three of their people. that's why I got promoted, actually.\n\nso, when I had some downtime, I scoured the depths of the kitchen, looking for oven thermometers, because no one I had asked knew if even we had any, and I finally dug some up.\n\nI rotated them through the old ovens, both to see if the oven thermometers themselves were working, and to check if the ovens were true to temperature. came back as yes on both. fantastic. I moved over to the new ovens and started rotating thermometers through them.\n\n**YOU'LL NEVER FUCKING GUESS WHAT I FOUND OUT!**\n\n...wait, did you guess that every single one of the new ovens were also exactly true to temperature? because that's what I found out.\n\nthe kicker, though, was performing the legendary Forbidden Technique\u2122, which I had been strongly warned against **ever** doing, lest I ruin a full rack of product - I ignored the book, set the *new oven* to the normal goddamned time and temperature, and threw a rack of cookies through.\n\nit obviously came out perfectly.\n\nthat was the day that I realized that, at some point, an entire kitchen staff came together to create a problem and solve it with what had to be the most left field concept and inefficient use of time I could ever imagine, rather than just fucking calibrating the ovens... \n\n*not that the ovens* actually needed *to be calibrated in the first place.*\n\nit's a big fucking joke, dude. I just run all my ovens on standard times and temps and haven't looked at the book in months. it still boggles my mind that it exists, though.",

I moved over to the new ovens and started rotating thermometers through them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YOU&#39;LL NEVER FUCKING GUESS WHAT I FOUND OUT!</strong></p>\n\n<p>...wait, did you guess that every single one of the new ovens were also exactly true to temperature? because that&#39;s what I found out.</p>\n\n<p>the kicker, though, was performing the legendary Forbidden Technique\u2122, which I had been strongly warned against <strong>ever</strong> doing, lest I ruin a full rack of product - I ignored the book, set the <em>new oven</em> to the normal goddamned time and temperature, and threw a rack of cookies through.</p>\n\n<p>it obviously came out perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>that was the day that I realized that, at some point, an entire kitchen staff came together to create a problem and solve it with what had to be the most left field concept and inefficient use of time I could ever imagine, rather than just fucking calibrating the ovens... </p>\n\n<p><em>not that the ovens</em> actually needed <em>to be calibrated in the first place.</em></p>\n\n<p>it&#39;s a big fucking joke, dude. I just run all my ovens on standard times and temps and haven&#39;t looked at the book in months. it still boggles my mind that it exists, though.</p>\n</div>",

Worldwide mining company, and I have worked as a contractor for them in the past. No less than a few hours after I completed the last of my hire package requirements for another contractor on a different mine site, I receive a text from a \"big mining company\" recruiter to call them regarding setting up a time for an interview. Before I had time to reply to the text (a little unconventional to have first contact over text, however typing that out, I realize the current job I accepted was over text as well haha) I Recieved a phone call from the recruiter.\n\nI was just pulling up to my place, Bluetooth connectivity issues so I rush to shut off my vehicle and step outside, it gets worse, a hydro vac truck is trenching 50 feet from me. So I dart inside and apologize for the noise and confusion. I hadn't given much though or preparation what I would say when I called them back, so I just clarified if they were calling about a specific job posting which quite frankly, I have never seen a more exact job posting than my skill set. The recruiter confirmed that was the one he was calling about.\n\nThe recruiter said the interview would be this coming Tuesday. This Tuesday is when I start my recently accepted position... The timing of this couldn't be worse.\n\nI had to turn down the interview.
