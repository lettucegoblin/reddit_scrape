Of course, none of this is likely, but it\u2019s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you\u2019re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won\u2019t consider possibilities that aren\u2019t annoying and miserable.
