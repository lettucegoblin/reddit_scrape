I&#39;m his bartender and have a job to do, so when I have to cut him off (which has been often of late) he gets nasty. Every time it&#39;s &quot;You&#39;ve done worse. You&#39;re a hypocritical asshole. I&#39;ve seen you more drunk.&quot; (etc.).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve talked to him while he was sober a few times now and let him know that, while I understand the position and apologize for who I used to be, that&#39;s not who I am anymore. Also: don&#39;t fucking treat me like that in my workplace when I&#39;m doing what the law requires me to. But mainly, buddy, that ain&#39;t me anymore. Let me change.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s been months of this and I think I&#39;ve decided to cut my losses and move on from that friendship. Which sucks, because I was friends with his girlfriend first and she&#39;s still awesome and has recognized the changes in me.</p>\n\n<p>Bummer.</p>\n</div>",

You introduce stress (poses) with a constant reminder to work on something, in this case aligning yourself with who you want to be. In the case of the pose, if you fall on your face, you can feel embarrassed or you can practice getting back up and feeling empowered to try again. \n\nWhen stress crops up in real life, your brain has all these little moments of practicing feeling uncomfortable while staying calm and relaxed (again because of the uncomfortable yoga poses) \n\nMy biggest yoga practice is driving, because it pisses me off and I feel terrible at it. It\u2019s a great place to practice aligning myself with better driving and better behavior.\n\nSorry this was so long, yoga is really changing my life and I just wanted to share. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yoga has been life changing for me. My favorite yoga trick that I learned is that the entire practice is about retraining your brain. You introduce stress (poses) with a constant reminder to work on something, in this case aligning yourself with who you want to be. In the case of the pose, if you fall on your face, you can feel embarrassed or you can practice getting back up and feeling empowered to try again. </p>\n\n<p>When stress crops up in real life, your brain has all these little moments of practicing feeling uncomfortable while staying calm and relaxed (again because of the uncomfortable yoga poses) </p>\n\n<p>My biggest yoga practice is driving, because it pisses me off and I feel terrible at it. It\u2019s a great place to practice aligning myself with better driving and better behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry this was so long, yoga is really changing my life and I just wanted to share.

There are so many small details that seem pointless at first but are super important clues for later events or foreshadowing. Re reading cosmere books is super rewarding. If you are still hesitant the series will in total be 10 books, however the series will have a soft end at book 5, with a satisfying ending and a 15 year time skip before the latter half. Brandon has described it as 2 sets of 5 books. So in that sense it's only 3ish years before the first series is finished and these books are looooong, each of them is over 1000 pages. If you're still hesitant I would recommend reading his other series like Mistborn, which is a complete trilogy. He also has 2 stand-alone novels (Elantris and Warbreaker) that are excellent. All of his books are set in the same universe but there is only small hints and references to this, it's not essential to read every book. There's also a second trilogy in the Mistborn series that will be finished in a few years set ~300 years after the first trilogy. If you are new to epic fantasy I would definitely recommend starting with the original Mistborn trilogy (Mistborn:the final empire, the well of ascension and hero of ages). Even if you were to stop after The Final Empire you get a pretty decently satisfying ending! It's very approachable and super fun, it's what got me into reading more fantasy.",
