Honestly, I&#39;m happy for him (the truth, as he was and still is one of my closest friends), but I could leave tomorrow and get that 35% raise somewhere else.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Big shocker, they wouldn&#39;t give me a raise. So the next day, I started applying for jobs. Within a month, I had an offer for 35% more and I took it. They asked me with a straight face why I was leaving. I respectfully reminded them about the pay discrepancy. I&#39;m still friends with a bunch of my old coworkers, but none of the leadership.</p>\n</div>",
