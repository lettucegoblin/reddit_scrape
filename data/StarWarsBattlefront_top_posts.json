You can see a list of all the developer responses [in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d4qft/star_wars_battlefront_ii_dice_developer_ama/dpvakkg/)\n\n---\n\nWelcome to the EA Star Wars Battlefront II Reddit Launch AMA!  \n\nToday we will be joined by 3 DICE developers who will answer your questions about Battlefront 2, its development, and its future.  \n\n# [PLEASE READ THE AMA RULES BEFORE POSTING](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d0793/information_about_the_ama_on_wednesday/).  \n\nQuick summary of the rules:  \n\n\n1.  Keep it civil. We will be heavily enforcing Rule #2 during the AMA: No harassment or inflammatory language will be tolerated. Be respectful to users. Violations of this rule during the AMA will result in a 3 day ban.  \n\n2.  Post questions only. Top level comments that are not questions will be removed.  \n\n3.  Limit yourself to one comment, with a max of 3 questions per comment. Multiple comments from the same user, or comments with more than 3 questions will be removed. Trust that the community wants to ask the same questions you do.  \n\n4.  Don't spam the same questions over and over again. Duplicates will be removed before the AMA starts. Just make sure you upvote questions you want answered, rather than posting a repeat of those questions.  \n\nAnd now, a word from the EA Community Manager!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________  \n \nWe would first like to thank the moderators of this subreddit and the passionate fanbase for allowing us to host an open dialogue around Star Wars Battlefront II. Your passion is inspiring, and our team hopes to provide as many answers as we can around your questions.  \n\nJoining us from our development team are the following:  \n\n * John Wasilczyk (Executive Producer) \u2013 /u/WazDICE  Introduction - Hi I'm John Wasilczyk, the executive producer for Battlefront 2. I started here at DICE a few months ago and it's been an adventure :) I've done a little bit of everything in the game industry over the last 15 years and I'm looking forward to growing the Battlefront community with all of you.\n\n * Dennis Brannvall (Associate Design Director) - /u/d_FireWall  Introduction - Hey all, My name is Dennis and I work as Design Director for Battlefront II. I hope some of you still remember me from the first Battlefront where I was working as Lead Designer on the post launch part of that game. For this game, I focused mainly on the gameplay side of things - troopers, heroes, vehicles, game modes, guns, feel. I'm that strange guy that actually prefers the TV-shows over the movies in many ways (I loooove Clone Wars - Ahsoka lives!!) and I also play a lot of board games and miniature games such as X-wing, Imperial Assault and Star Wars Destiny. Hopefully I'm able to answer your questions in a good way!\n\n * Paul Keslin (Producer) \u2013 /u/TheVestalViking  Introduction - Hi everyone, I'm Paul Keslin, one of the Multiplayer Producers over at DICE. My main responsibilities for the game revolved around the Troopers, Heroes, and some of our mounted vehicles (including the TaunTaun!). Additionally I collaborate closely with our partners at Lucasfilm to help bring the game together.\n\nPlease follow [the guidelines outlined by the Subreddit moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7d0793/information_about_the_ama_on_wednesday) in posting your questions.",
