        "body": "I found this as a comment on another post. I just want to help share this.  \nUrban warfare tips from a former Marine.  \nI am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can\u2019t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.  \nFor the defenders of Kiev, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :  \n1.) Stay out of the steet.  \n2.) Stay out of street.  \n3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.  \n4.) Doors are called \u201cthe fatal funnel.\u201d It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.  \n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn\u2019t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.  \n6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.  \n7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You\u2019ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.  \n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don\u2019t look above or below until last.  \n9.) Don\u2019t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.  \n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it\u2019s much more handy than a rifle.  \n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.  \n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don\u2019t expose it.  \n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.  \n14.) If you wound an enemy, don\u2019t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That\u2019s four less rifles firing at you.  \n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. 16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.  \n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.  \n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don\u2019t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area. 19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.  \n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It\u2019s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.  \n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.  \n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.  \nI don\u2019t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.  \nGlory to Ukraine.  \nEdit: A few extras.  \n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.  \n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.  \n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force. 26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.  \n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.  \n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.  \n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. 30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long",

It might save invaluable lives. Stay safe everyone.\n\nUrban warfare tips from a former Marine. I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can\u2019t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.For the defenders of Kyiv, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :\n\n1.) Stay out of the steet. 2.) Stay out of street. 3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.\n\n4.) Doors are called \u201cthe fatal funnel.\u201d It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.\n\n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn\u2019t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. 6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. 7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You\u2019ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.\n\n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don\u2019t look above or below until last.\n\n9.) Don\u2019t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.\n\n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it\u2019s much more handy than a rifle.\n\n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.\n\n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don\u2019t expose it.\n\n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.\n\n14.) If you wound an enemy, don\u2019t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That\u2019s four less rifles firing at you.\n\n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.\n\n16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.\n\n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.\n\n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don\u2019t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.\n\n19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.\n\n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It\u2019s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.\n\n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.\n\n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.I don\u2019t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.Glory to Ukraine.Edit: A few extras.\n\n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.\n\n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.\n\n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.\n\n26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.\n\n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.\n\n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.\n\n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.\n\n30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long\n\nEdit: formatted for ease of reading.\n\nEdit Edit: I am not the OP",

I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.For the defenders of Kyiv, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :</p>\n\n<p>1.) Stay out of the steet. 2.) Stay out of street. 3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.</p>\n\n<p>4.) Doors are called \u201cthe fatal funnel.\u201d It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.</p>\n\n<p>5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn\u2019t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. 6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. 7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You\u2019ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.</p>\n\n<p>8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don\u2019t look above or below until last.</p>\n\n<p>9.) Don\u2019t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.</p>\n\n<p>10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it\u2019s much more handy than a rifle.</p>\n\n<p>11.) Never fire from the same window twice.</p>\n\n<p>12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don\u2019t expose it.</p>\n\n<p>13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.</p>\n\n<p>14.) If you wound an enemy, don\u2019t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That\u2019s four less rifles firing at you.</p>\n\n<p>15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.</p>\n\n<p>16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.</p>\n\n<p>17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.</p>\n\n<p>18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don\u2019t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.</p>\n\n<p>19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It\u2019s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.</p>\n\n<p>21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.</p>\n\n<p>22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.I don\u2019t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.Glory to Ukraine.Edit: A few extras.</p>\n\n<p>23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.</p>\n\n<p>24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.</p>\n\n<p>26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.</p>\n\n<p>27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.</p>\n\n<p>28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.</p>\n\n<p>29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.</p>\n\n<p>30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long</p>\n\n<p>Edit: formatted for ease of reading.</p>\n\n<p>Edit Edit: I am not the OP</p>\n</div>",
