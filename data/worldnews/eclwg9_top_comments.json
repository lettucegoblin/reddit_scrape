What is the evidence for this corruption? Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian company that was the subject of a then  dormant investigation, and his father who was VP went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold aid if they didn&#39;t fire the prosecutor that wasn&#39;t even investigating the company Hunter Biden worked for. Nevermind the fact that it was not only the policy of the United States but also the entire western world that wanted that prosecuted fired. </p>\n\n<p>Wait hold on a second, if it&#39;s well established that the prosecutor was corrupt, and the investigation into the corruption of the company Hunter Biden worked for was dormant, then doesn&#39;t that mean a new, not corrupt prosecutor would take over and possibly reopen and continue that investigation? </p>\n\n<p>And hold on another second, if the US was going to pressure Ukraine to fire that prosecutor regardless of who they sent to send the message, is it even a conflict of interest at all if the result was going to be the same?</p>\n\n<p>What the fuck? Did the entire Republican argument completely collapse under its own weight? Could that mean... they&#39;ve been arguing in bad faith this entire time? There&#39;s no legitimate reason to ask a foreign leader to investigate your political rival?</p>\n\n<p>Holy shit.</p>\n</div>",
