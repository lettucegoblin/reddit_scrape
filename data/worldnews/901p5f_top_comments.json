        "body": "!-- ***FOR ANYONE WHO CAN'T READ THE ARTICLE:*** (Ctrl+F helper: mirror; text)--!\n\n\nFrom the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered\n\nDavid E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy\u00a0David E. Sanger\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin\u2019s role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\u00a0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\u00a0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin\u2019s own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D.

Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times</p>\n\n<p>By\u00a0David E. Sanger\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg</p>\n\n<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.</p>\n\n<p>The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)</p>\n\n<p>Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the run-up to this week\u2019s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.</p>\n\n<p>The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.</p>\n\n<p>The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.</p>\n\n<p>According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin\u2019s role in the election interference.</p>\n\n<p>President-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times</p>\n\n<p>They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\u00a0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\u00a0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.</p>\n\n<p>And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin\u2019s own role.</p>\n\n<p>That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.</p>\n\n<p>The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d to dig in.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.</p>\n\n<p>After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said \u201cRussia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries\u201d were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations \u2014 including the D.N.C.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, \u201cthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,\u201d he said in testimony in May 2017. \u201cAnd they were very aggressive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated.

        "body": "> The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nWow.\n\n> Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nAnd this is ultimately the damning part. If you stop and take a step back and think about how, since 2017, Donald Trump has known it was Putin, it makes all of his statements on Russian hacking more shady, because he *has* done nothing except try to confuse everyone with statements in every direction:\n\n\"It wasn't Putin\", \"It was Putin, but it could've been others\", \"It was Putin!\", \"It was the Democrats\", etc. etc. etc.\n\nExhibit A:\n\n> On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\n> On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\n> Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nThree days - four different stances. On Monday it's \"Russia didn't do it\". On Tuesday it's \"Russia did it\", and on Wednesday it's \"Russia did it but they stopped\" (which makes no sense seeing as they've faced no repercussions for it since).\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo ultimately, this is where I have the most issues with Donald Trump. You're the President. You know Russia attacked us. Okay, they did it to help you, but you had nothing to do with it!

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is ultimately the damning part. If you stop and take a step back and think about how, since 2017, Donald Trump has known it was Putin, it makes all of his statements on Russian hacking more shady, because he <em>has</em> done nothing except try to confuse everyone with statements in every direction:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t Putin&quot;, &quot;It was Putin, but it could&#39;ve been others&quot;, &quot;It was Putin!&quot;, &quot;It was the Democrats&quot;, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Exhibit A:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)</p>\n\n<p>Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Three days - four different stances. On Monday it&#39;s &quot;Russia didn&#39;t do it&quot;. On Tuesday it&#39;s &quot;Russia did it&quot;, and on Wednesday it&#39;s &quot;Russia did it but they stopped&quot; (which makes no sense seeing as they&#39;ve faced no repercussions for it since).</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>So ultimately, this is where I have the most issues with Donald Trump. You&#39;re the President. You know Russia attacked us. Okay, they did it to help you, but you had nothing to do with it! How do you handle it?</p>\n\n<p>And every single scenario where I place myself into the POTUS&#39;s shoes and ask myself how I move forward knowing a foreign country interfered with our election and how I should handle it, is the <em>exact</em> opposite of how Trump has handled it.</p>\n\n<p>I would immediately issue punishment to that country - Trump actually refuses to sign sanctions for several months, and when he does, they&#39;re extremely watered down sanctions with no real impact.</p>\n\n<p>I would immediately issue a statement condemning and recognizing that the event took place - Trump, as we all know, has made statements in every single direction trying to sow confusion where their should be clarity.</p>\n\n<p>I would, even if it&#39;s a symbolic thing, create or announce a task force specifically designed to combat cyberattacks against this country.
