        "body": "\nMy take on NATO\u2019s strategy here. Putin\u2019s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin\u2019s logical madness. \n\nNATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin\u2019s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. \n\nWhen toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. \n\nThe issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin\u2019s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe\u2019s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO\u2019s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. \n\nAs Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to \u201ccontested\u201d regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. \n\nWith Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin\u2019s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. \n\nThe west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn\u2019t know, and isn\u2019t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.\n\ndit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I\u2019m just calling it like I see it.\n\nEdit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people\u2019s response to my views.",

People who protest are considered \"being out of common sense\" and \"surrenderists\" or even worse by various media. It seems to repeat something along the Nazi propaganda lines.\nIt is hard to flee anywhere since I don't have international passport due to not serving yet.\nI love my country and I love most of the citizens. But seems like most of who don't want war now have the following thoughts: \"I can ruin anything for me and I'm ready. I can ruin everything for my child if my grandchildren are going to be in a better world. But who can assure me there won't be mad dictator along the lines of resistance who will take power vacuum after.\". It seems to be common thought since we have 2 examples of such shit happened within last century in just one country. Some people want to leave, but scared for their family and relatives staying in Russia. Most people know there most likely won't be a \"big war\", but things like this don't make anyone life better.\nI have friends from Ukraine and I don't know why they and any Ukrainian should suffer things like these. I have a lot of things to say, but I'm worry about wall of text that is here already. I never felt worse for being unable to do something of large scale.\n\nUpd.: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger.\n\nUpd.2: My own grandmother(though we are pretty distant now despite being closest relatives) sending me overly nationalistic videos through WhatsApp. I don't even know what to answer. Probably nothing. Her husband was officer, defending the USSR until his retirement. He died from lung cancer and heart disease combined with various other illnesses with nothing to leave after except the flat and Officer's pension. Now she is not poor on Russian pensioner standards, but it still definitely not enough to live OK. Her father died while freeing Europe from Nazi fighting from first days of the war(WW2) until almost the end of it. Idk why the hell am I even adding this as update, but it just made me totally uncomfortable.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It is hard to be simple Russian guy rn. I lost every links with my best friend, who had been taken to Ukraine while being on mandatory army service. People who protest are considered &quot;being out of common sense&quot; and &quot;surrenderists&quot; or even worse by various media. It seems to repeat something along the Nazi propaganda lines.\nIt is hard to flee anywhere since I don&#39;t have international passport due to not serving yet.\nI love my country and I love most of the citizens. But seems like most of who don&#39;t want war now have the following thoughts: &quot;I can ruin anything for me and I&#39;m ready. I can ruin everything for my child if my grandchildren are going to be in a better world. But who can assure me there won&#39;t be mad dictator along the lines of resistance who will take power vacuum after.&quot;. It seems to be common thought since we have 2 examples of such shit happened within last century in just one country. Some people want to leave, but scared for their family and relatives staying in Russia. Most people know there most likely won&#39;t be a &quot;big war&quot;, but things like this don&#39;t make anyone life better.\nI have friends from Ukraine and I don&#39;t know why they and any Ukrainian should suffer things like these. I have a lot of things to say, but I&#39;m worry about wall of text that is here already. I never felt worse for being unable to do something of large scale.</p>\n\n<p>Upd.: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger.</p>\n\n<p>Upd.2: My own grandmother(though we are pretty distant now despite being closest relatives) sending me overly nationalistic videos through WhatsApp. I don&#39;t even know what to answer. Probably nothing. Her husband was officer, defending the USSR until his retirement. He died from lung cancer and heart disease combined with various other illnesses with nothing to leave after except the flat and Officer&#39;s pension. Now she is not poor on Russian pensioner standards, but it still definitely not enough to live OK. Her father died while freeing Europe from Nazi fighting from first days of the war(WW2) until almost the end of it. Idk why the hell am I even adding this as update, but it just made me totally uncomfortable.</p>\n</div>",
