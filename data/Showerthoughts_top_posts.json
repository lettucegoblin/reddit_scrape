Or, in a different interpretation, this action distabilized the Force since the Sith had more control over the universe. The action that brought balance to the Force was when he, as Vader, killed Palpatine. As u/Sarahneth mentioned, he also brought balance to his pod racer as well, if we're being very literal.",
