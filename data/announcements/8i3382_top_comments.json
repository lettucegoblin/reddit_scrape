I have a friend who works in the industry and she explained it me.\n\nNet neutrality means that all traffic is created equal.\n\nSounds good, don't it?\n\nBut that goes both ways. Let me put it another way:\n\nYour Fortnite traffic is equal to a grandmother's netflix.\n\nYour Fortnite traffic is a few KBs a second, the grandmother's traffic is several megabits. But because all traffic has to be treated equally, that grandmother's 15mb/s worth of streaming video can slow down your 5kb/s of video game traffic. Your ping times suffer, while the old grandmother doesn't even notice.\n\nWith relaxed net neutrality rules that allow for traffic to be treated differently for different purposes (I.E. things that require low ping time being given priority over regular downloads, streaming media, torrents, etc) it would open up different avenues for ISPs to provide service to customers.\n\nWant the best game service possible? You pay X amount of money. Don't care about games and are willing to take unoptimized connections because you just watch netflix and won't notice? You pay less money per month.\n\nThis is of course in an ideal America where Comcunts and AT&T aren't out to suck every fucking dollar from your pockets and give the least quality of service possible.\n\nUnder current conditions, your network is as good as the distance to the closest exchange, and if someone 'upstream' from your is sucking up all the bandwidth, well too bad. And with the swap over to digital streaming instead of televised shows, internet consumption is going up. More than two thirds of internet traffic now is streaming video: https://www.businessinsider.com.au/sandvine-bandwidth-data-shows-70-of-internet-traffic-is-video-and-music-streaming-2015-12?r=US&IR=T If your local lines are at capacity, you're fucked. Your internet suffers and the ISPs aren't allowed to implement proper quality-of-service changes because 'all traffic has to be treated equal'.\n\nBut all traffic isn't equal. Some traffic needs priority for the smoothest user experience, while other traffic can take a hit of a few dozen milliseconds and the user won't notice.\n\n*That* is the argument against net neutrality. *That* is why people can say that the removal of net neutrality is a good thing.\n\nI mean, the removal of net neutrality definitely *isn't* a good thing because it's not being replaced with anything that would ensure that the corporations won't abuse the new lack of regulation to make the internet even worse.\n\nSaying that you can't see why someone could think net neutrality is a bad thing just means you haven't researched the issue.\n\nI at least have a more nuanced understanding of the situation and the arguments for and against because of my friend. I think net neutrality *should* be replaced with something more fitting than laws written up from before the internet was even a thing, but this is *not* the way to do it.\n\nShit Pie does not have the interest of the public at heart and that's why I support net neutrality, not because 'I can't even see why anyone wouldn't want net neutrality' . That just means you've only been exposed to one viewpoint, and one side of the argument.\n\nAnd nobody should make decisions based on one side of any argument.",

But because all traffic has to be treated equally, that grandmother&#39;s 15mb/s worth of streaming video can slow down your 5kb/s of video game traffic. Your ping times suffer, while the old grandmother doesn&#39;t even notice.</p>\n\n<p>With relaxed net neutrality rules that allow for traffic to be treated differently for different purposes (I.E. things that require low ping time being given priority over regular downloads, streaming media, torrents, etc) it would open up different avenues for ISPs to provide service to customers.</p>\n\n<p>Want the best game service possible? You pay X amount of money. Don&#39;t care about games and are willing to take unoptimized connections because you just watch netflix and won&#39;t notice? You pay less money per month.</p>\n\n<p>This is of course in an ideal America where Comcunts and AT&amp;T aren&#39;t out to suck every fucking dollar from your pockets and give the least quality of service possible.</p>\n\n<p>Under current conditions, your network is as good as the distance to the closest exchange, and if someone &#39;upstream&#39; from your is sucking up all the bandwidth, well too bad. And with the swap over to digital streaming instead of televised shows, internet consumption is going up. More than two thirds of internet traffic now is streaming video: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/sandvine-bandwidth-data-shows-70-of-internet-traffic-is-video-and-music-streaming-2015-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\">https://www.businessinsider.com.au/sandvine-bandwidth-data-shows-70-of-internet-traffic-is-video-and-music-streaming-2015-12?r=US&amp;IR=T</a> If your local lines are at capacity, you&#39;re fucked. Your internet suffers and the ISPs aren&#39;t allowed to implement proper quality-of-service changes because &#39;all traffic has to be treated equal&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>But all traffic isn&#39;t equal. Some traffic needs priority for the smoothest user experience, while other traffic can take a hit of a few dozen milliseconds and the user won&#39;t notice.</p>\n\n<p><em>That</em> is the argument against net neutrality. <em>That</em> is why people can say that the removal of net neutrality is a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, the removal of net neutrality definitely <em>isn&#39;t</em> a good thing because it&#39;s not being replaced with anything that would ensure that the corporations won&#39;t abuse the new lack of regulation to make the internet even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Saying that you can&#39;t see why someone could think net neutrality is a bad thing just means you haven&#39;t researched the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I at least have a more nuanced understanding of the situation and the arguments for and against because of my friend. I think net neutrality <em>should</em> be replaced with something more fitting than laws written up from before the internet was even a thing, but this is <em>not</em> the way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Shit Pie does not have the interest of the public at heart and that&#39;s why I support net neutrality, not because &#39;I can&#39;t even see why anyone wouldn&#39;t want net neutrality&#39; . That just means you&#39;ve only been exposed to one viewpoint, and one side of the argument.</p>\n\n<p>And nobody should make decisions based on one side of any argument.</p>\n</div>",

All I want is free healthcare I don't give a shit if 1500 bucks comes out of my check every year, when I do my taxes I still have to pay a fee of 50 dollars a month for not having enough money to have health insurance. Why not take that 600 dollars you take every year from the thousands of Americans who don't have health insurance and put it toward something useful. I shouldn't be penalized for busting my ass all year and then get fucked in said ass because almost no company around here offers health insurance, and the places that do still don't cover shit. I still have 3 ER visits that I could never pay off totalling over 8 grand. And that's after my insurance, from a government job I use to have I might add. I really do despise this country as a power, not for our people. Protests do not do anything. The government isn't like a fucking cereal company where if they use dog nails or some shit in the process people can be like \"dogs are people too we need to reprimand these heinous corporate douches\" then they get some bad PR and try to make up for it, no they run our shit. Hell In my town we've had the same corrupt ass sherrifs department since before I was born, it's a known fact our previous mayor was involved in liquidating drugs from evidence with the sherrifs department that went \"missing\". I fucking hate this place man I don't want to raise my 2 year old in all this stupid shit. Especially not now with how kids are and this coming from someone fairly fresh out of high school. I've had to work my ass off for everything I have and it's not much.
