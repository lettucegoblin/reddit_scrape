I am aware [removed] is your pass word. Moreover, I know your secret and I've proof of this. You do not know me personally and nobody paid me to examine you. \n\nIt's just your hard luck that I came across your misdemeanor. In fact, I placed a malware on the adult vids (porn material) and you visited this web site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your web browser began functioning as a Rdp (Remote control desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and cam. After that, my software program gathered every one of your contacts from social networks, and e-mail. \n\nAfter that I put in more time than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double screen video. 1st part displays the recording you had been watching and second part shows the view of your web camera (its you doing dirty things).\n\nHonestly, I am ready to forget all information about you and let you continue with your regular life. And I am going to provide you two options which will achieve that. These two options are either to ignore this letter, or perhaps pay me $1200. Let us examine these two options in details. \n\nOption One is to ignore this e mail. You should know what will happen if you opt this option. I will send out your video to your entire contacts including close relatives, colleagues, and so forth. It does not help you avoid the humiliation your self will face when friends and family learn your unpleasant videos from me. \n\nSecond Option is to send me $1200. We\u2019ll name it my \u201cprivacy charges\u201d. Now lets see what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I will destroy the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if none of this ever occurred. \n\nNow you may be thinking, \u201cI should call the cops\u201d. Without a doubt, I've covered my steps to ensure this e mail cannot be traced time for me and yes it won't prevent the evidence from destroying your life. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I am just looking to get compensated for time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you've decided to create this all disappear and pay me my confidentiality fee. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know how, type \"how to buy bitcoins\" in google) \n\nTransfer Amount: $1200 \nBitcoin Address to Send: 1P4xHsXFXHK*ZrBJ5jCdSoNptHb3N6hXEuM ( You must Remove * from this string and copy and paste it carefully) \n\nExpalin no-one what you would be transferring the bitcoin for or they might not give it to you. The task to get bitcoins will take a few days so do not put it off.\nI have a specific pixel in this email message, and now I know that you've read through this mail. You have 48 hours to make the payment. If I do not get the BitCoins, I definitely will send your video to all your contacts including family members, coworkers, and so on. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the proof and all other proofs immediately. It is a non negotiable one time offer, thus kindly do not waste my personal time & yours. Your time has started. You should be aware that my malware will still be keeping tracking of the actions you adopt when you are done reading this message. To be honest, If I see any wrong activity from your browser history then I will have to send out your sextape to your close relatives, colleagues before your time finishes.\n\n\nEdit: Just to add I knew it was a scam.  I received the email on July 31st at 02:55am.  This was the only account that I used that basic password that has had a security scare recently.  I posted the full email just so people could maybe see the consequence of the hack.  Happy to provide the email to Reddit admins if it helps locate the hacker.  ",

You don't know me and nobody hired me to examine you.\n\nIt is just your misfortune that I came across your misadventures.

While you were watching video clips, your internet browser started out working as a Rdp (Remote desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your screen as well as cam.

And I am about to provide you two options that will achieve that. These two choices are to either ignore this letter, or just pay me $2700. Let\u2019s investigate these two options in more details.\n\nOption One is to ignore this mail. Let us see what is going to happen if you opt this option. I will definately send your video recording to all of your contacts including members of your family, co-workers, etc. It does not save you from the humiliation you and your family will have to face when relatives and buddies learn your dirty details from me.\n\nOption 2 is to make the payment of $2700. We will name this my \u201cprivacy tip\u201d. I will explain what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I'll delete the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if nothing like this ever occurred.\n\nNow you must be thinking, \u201cI'm going to report to the cops\u201d. Let me tell you, I've covered my steps to ensure that this message can't be traced time for me also it won't steer clear of the evidence from destroying your lifetime.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Interestingly enough I happened to get this on Monday, which had my old reddit accounts password as the subject and again had it in the message, which i will censor in the post.  Here you go:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s get straight to the point. I know that ******* is your password. More importantly, I know your secret and I&#39;ve evidence of it. You don&#39;t know me and nobody hired me to examine you.</p>\n\n<p>It is just your misfortune that I came across your misadventures. Let me tell you, I setup a malware on the adult video clips (porn material) and you visited this site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your internet browser started out working as a Rdp (Remote desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your screen as well as cam. After that, my software gathered your complete contacts from your messenger, facebook, as well as email.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I put in more hours than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching and other part displays the video of your web camera (its you doing nasty things).</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I am ready to forget all about you and allow you to get on with your life. And I am about to provide you two options that will achieve that. These two choices are to either ignore this letter, or just pay me $2700. Let\u2019s investigate these two options in more details.</p>\n\n<p>Option One is to ignore this mail. Let us see what is going to happen if you opt this option. I will definately send your video recording to all of your contacts including members of your family, co-workers, etc. It does not save you from the humiliation you and your family will have to face when relatives and buddies learn your dirty details from me.</p>\n\n<p>Option 2 is to make the payment of $2700. We will name this my \u201cprivacy tip\u201d. I will explain what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I&#39;ll delete the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if nothing like this ever occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Now you must be thinking, \u201cI&#39;m going to report to the cops\u201d. Let me tell you, I&#39;ve covered my steps to ensure that this message can&#39;t be traced time for me also it won&#39;t steer clear of the evidence from destroying your lifetime. I&#39;m not looking to dig a hole in your pocket. I am just looking to get compensated for efforts and time I put in investigating you. Let&#39;s hope you have chosen to produce all of this disappear completely and pay me the confidentiality fee.

What jobs I had, where I lived etc.  They checked my financial records etc,   3 personal 2 work references not at current company.  Any bankruptcy/debt etc.  I detailed everything, I was paying off a collections debt mess.  I explained it all.  Never had an issue or a callback on it.   Others had issues with it because they omitted stuff and then had to sit and be grilled on why.   Trying to 'hide' stuff and hope they don't find it never worked.  Honestly integrity etc is huge.   In the industry you build a reputation and that is important. \n\nIt took me 3 weeks just to gather the data.  I now have a nice record of all of that information.

What jobs I had, where I lived etc.  They checked my financial records etc,   3 personal 2 work references not at current company.  Any bankruptcy/debt etc.  I detailed everything, I was paying off a collections debt mess.  I explained it all.  Never had an issue or a callback on it.   Others had issues with it because they omitted stuff and then had to sit and be grilled on why.   Trying to &#39;hide&#39; stuff and hope they don&#39;t find it never worked.  Honestly integrity etc is huge.   In the industry you build a reputation and that is important. </p>\n\n<p>It took me 3 weeks just to gather the data.

Salts are usually randomized for each user and stored in the database right alongside the hashed password. If you can get to the hashed password, you can get to the salt, so there's no guesswork involved. The actual purpose of salting, by my understanding, is to render rainbow tables useless. Given the password 'hunter2' and an unsalted database, you can take the hash, no matter the algorithm, punch it into a reverse hash lookup site, or possibly even Google, and out pops 'hunter2'. Given a database dump of 1,000,000 users including email addresses and passwords, you can dump everything into a pivot table and find all of the most common passwords and all of the users that share them and then you've owned thousands of people at once (if they're using a common or simple password, they're probably using it for everything). If you throw a randomized six-character salt on the end of every password, even if the salt is stored in the same database, you are forcing the attacker to individually brute force every single entry that they want the password for, which greatly reduces the reward for stealing your database and also further protects your users in the event of a beach.",
