You won't pay $10 for Facebook, $5 for streaming sites, etc... or things like that. You won't have access to certain sites blocked.\n\nRather, it will happen slowly and secretly over the next few years, which is arguably worse. You'll notice Netflix and Twitch will start buffering more and more while your ISP sends you a mailer to buy their cable/movie package. Your VoIP will drop calls while your ISP promotes a competitor at a \"special\" price. Independent online games will struggle to have reliable pings while AAA games seem to have no problem.\n\nHow do we know this will happen? Because ISPs have already tried this in the past when the legality was unclear. Now that it's fully legal, what will stop them?\n\nIn the meantime, you'll forget. When they don't charge $3 for access to Netflix, you'll think to yourself that the whole #NetNeutrality cause was overblown. You won't notice the gradual decline of your ISP, and you'll forget what you once expected of them. The ISPs will win unless we continue to fight, but I find it hard to believe that we can maintain this anger for so much longer.\n\nISPs have done this before. And repealing Net Neutrality only enables them more.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I posted this elsewhere, but I feel like copying it here.</p>\n\n<p>The death of Net Neutrality will not affect you overnight like most places are reporting. You won&#39;t pay $10 for Facebook, $5 for streaming sites, etc... or things like that. You won&#39;t have access to certain sites blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, it will happen slowly and secretly over the next few years, which is arguably worse. You&#39;ll notice Netflix and Twitch will start buffering more and more while your ISP sends you a mailer to buy their cable/movie package. Your VoIP will drop calls while your ISP promotes a competitor at a &quot;special&quot; price. Independent online games will struggle to have reliable pings while AAA games seem to have no problem.</p>\n\n<p>How do we know this will happen? Because ISPs have already tried this in the past when the legality was unclear. Now that it&#39;s fully legal, what will stop them?</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, you&#39;ll forget. When they don&#39;t charge $3 for access to Netflix, you&#39;ll think to yourself that the whole #NetNeutrality cause was overblown. You won&#39;t notice the gradual decline of your ISP, and you&#39;ll forget what you once expected of them. The ISPs will win unless we continue to fight, but I find it hard to believe that we can maintain this anger for so much longer.</p>\n\n<p>ISPs have done this before.

Comcast and other internet providers think that this&#39;ll slip under the radar, that after a few months of peace and quiet we will become complacent.</p>\n\n<p>We need to prove them wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Keep contacting our senators, not to stop the FCC, but to approve of a national Net Neutrality LAW. Contact local senators to get state laws. I know Comcast wanted stipulations that there could not be local laws supporting title two net number, but I don&#39;t think that got in the final bill.</p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s a court case (which there probably will be) support that.</p>\n\n<p>I know it&#39;s hard with no end goal in sight. But never let this become normal. Don&#39;t go quietly into that goodnight. Fight all the way. Don&#39;t forget net neutrality.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;ve talked to people that are happy things pass that <strong>financially hurt them, badly</strong> because they think it&#39;s funny that it &quot;pisses off the libtards,&quot; (or Republicans), and they&#39;re generally happy about that. HOW!?!?</p>\n\n<p>Before Trump came into play, the GOP was planning on doing a &#39;rebranding&#39; with celebrities touring the country to try and lure young people to their party because they could see that their typical supporter was about 60. Then Trump won and they got their puppet. It doesn&#39;t matter regarding their voter base anymore because they don&#39;t need them. They can cater to their donors, to their bribes, and to their friends. What&#39;s sickening to me is that they do it in such a brash, in-your-face way, like they&#39;re saying, &quot;We honestly don&#39;t care how you feel.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In all honesty, if some of these people are still in their jobs after the next voting cycle, it really shows you the level of ignorance that people choose to have. It takes 10 minutes online to find out how these bills will affect you personally, and now with the &#39;party over policy&#39; attitude people have, we&#39;re turning into Idiocracy.</p>\n\n<p>Our country is a joke, and our government is a joke, and our President is a ridiculous disgrace of a human being.</p>\n</div>",

If I get another gold do I have to send him an iPad too? I've confused myself.\n\nEdit 2: Darn it guys, now I gotta buy Tim Cook an iPad. I don't even know which size he'd want. What's next, I gotta spring for an Apple TV, too?\n\nEdit 3: Holy crap, you guys, I'm not made of money over here! I owe this guy an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV, next thing you're gonna tell me is he gets a Macbook, too!\n\nEdit 4: This just isn't fair. It's Christmas time and I have presents to buy. It's not like I can run out tonight and pick up a Mac Pro for the CEO of Apple. You guys gotta cut this out.\n\nEdit 5 and 6: Look. I'll level with you. I'm sitting here surrounded by Apple products addressed to Tim Cook and I'm running out of ideas. What do you people want with me? You want me to go buy him a literal bag of apples? Like just a bunch of gala apples for the CEO of Apple?\n\nEdit 7: This is getting out of hand, folks. The people at the mall and the grocery store are giving me really, really weird looks. I literally have nowhere to sit, there's so much A(a)pple in my apartment. I suppose now I gotta also send him Apples to Apples too?",
