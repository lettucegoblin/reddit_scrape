        "body": "I was an intern on Capitol Hill a few years ago and would like to give a little more insight into what happens when you call your representative. \n\n1. Your call is going to be answered by either a low-paid, overworked Staff Assistant, or often times an unpaid, overworked intern. BE POLITE. I cant tell you how many times someone called yelling at an intern to make the world perfect.\n2. My office recorded down the content of the calls, the position of the caller on the issue, and where they are from. If the caller was not from the constituency, then would politely direct them to their own Representative. If they were nice, I would even look up their Rep or Senator and give them their office number.\n3. It may also be beneficial to know that the staff/interns answering phone calls are given scripts pertaining to specific positions, or lack of position that a Rep/Sen may have. It's not worth it to argue with interns/Staff Assistants because we are just telling callers what we are told to say. Deviating from the script may lead to social media or other posts saying something like, \"a source within Sen/Rep's office today confirmed that the Sen/Rep's real position is _____ on the issue of pepsi vs coca cola.\"\n4. The Senator/Representative will get a tally at the end of the week telling them how many people called about what issue, not about the specific content of the calls. It basically is something like: 1000 people called in support of net neutrality, 50 people called in support of legalizing hemp, etc.\n\nIt is important to:\nKeep your expectations low: Senators and Representatives have busy schedules and will not take constituent calls 99.99% of the time, even if you ask to \"talk to the Senator/Representative\"\n\nAgain, be polite. The people answering the phones are literally at the bottom of the food chain, and can also have bad days too. You would be surprised with what kindness can do. I was willing to take a few extra steps to help people along every time someone was nice and polite.\n\nEDIT: Included script information\nEDIT 2: Im working a job right now that employs Administrative Assistants, and I blended the two positions together in my mind, so replaced Administrative Assistants with Staff Assistants ",

Keep in mind I do occasionally go on T_D now and then to shitpost but most of the time it's for laughs. I'm a conservative who hated, HATED the repeal and didn't agree with it in the slightest. \n\n\nYes you can find posts on there saying why the repeal would be good Yaya yada and posts praising the repeal, but a lot and I mean a LOT of the users generally didn't agree with the repeal and didn't want it. A lot of comments made it to the top on those pro Net Neutrality repeal saying why it was a bad decision. The_Donald was split for real that day between those that were for it and against it. When Reddit first started making strides to stop it, some users mentioned trying to rally The_Donald to try and help them fight for NN, yet other users with highly up voted comments said that The_Donald can go suck it and fuck them we don't need there help we can do this without them. Had the some reddit users put aside there differences and encourage T_D to help out, it would have been very beneficial to ALL of us, no matter the political view. Instead, the opposite happened and T_D users who were undecided decided to be for the repeal as a way to say fuck you to Reddit. Reddit Alienated The_Donald from the net Neutrality cause, you don't do that to one of the largest and most active non default subs on the sight, a sub that would have been a great help in the cause. *The enemy of my enemy is my friend* as they say, the reddit users who said those things and pushing T_D away from the cause made a mistake, they made a lot of users who would have helped out NOT help out. \n\n\nWe can all disagree on politics and smear each other for that in our politically motivated subs all day, but when it came to Net Neutrality, having The_Donald as a ally to defend the internet would have really come in handy DESPITE the differences and disdain T_D and the rest of Reddit has for each other. I know some users will not like this comment, but I feel it needed to be said. \n\n\nI thank you all for reading this if you made it this far, no matter your political view I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day and hopefully NN comes back, I have made my calls and letters, we won't go quietly.\n\nEdit: I said my piece, disagree if you would like I don't want to get into a big argument about it as it's pointless at this point. I'm just saying what I felt a lot of other users were feeling about the issue. I'm not a T_D user like I said, I will ocaciaonly visit to joke and shitpost but that's it. I'm not a Trump fanatic, I'm a conservative who dislikes republicans and many of Trumps decisions like the rest of you.\n\n\nEdit 2: Also fuck Ajit Pai. \n\n\nEdit 3: You people below have proved my point.

If the goal is to contact a senator, send a letter to the editor to a few of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in your state. If you're trying to contact a representative, send it to any newspapers within your district. In either case, make sure to mention the legislator you're trying to reach by name, preferably in the title. You should also look up the submission requirements for any newspapers you'd like to try to get to publish your letter.\n\nWhy the letter to the editor? Legislators are more likely to be influenced by a letter if they have reason to believe it could influence the opinions of their constituents, whose support they'll need to be re-elected.\n\nFrom what I can tell from having worked in a senator's office for a summer, they almost never will read a letter or an email you send them directly. A staffer will do that, and if enough letters on a given subject come in, that staffer will draft a form letter response to send back to constituents.\n\nBut, in the office in which I worked, any letter to the editor that mentioned my senator by name and appeared in one of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in the state was included in a document that he read first thing every morning. I was often tasked with organizing and printing off copies of the document. I printed off the documents in the basement, where interns from a number of other senate offices were doing essentially the same thing that I did. So I know that practice was not exclusive to our office.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nCall your legislators, because that's the easiest and least time-intensive tactic available.  Send them emails and letters at well.  Those tactics are useful. \n\nBut if you have the time, you should consider writing a letter to the editor and trying to get it published in a newspaper.

Because it's so expensive to build out your own network, and you have to do that before you can even consider selling your service. Net Neutrality means that at least if you've done that, the networks you hook into have to treat your customer's data like all the other data and pass it through at a reasonable speed.

Is it really that hard for you to grasp why people may not want to work with you guys? I'm pretty sure there was a sticky made by the mods there that showed they were against NN. Not to mention even if we did want to work together, it's kind of impossible for people on the other side to align with you when being a fanatical Trump supporter is basically a requirement, or you get banned.

I wish you were alienated more, to be honest. Your subreddit should just be banned entirely. Your entire post is blaming everyone but your subreddit.

If you find the shit they do funny, and contribute to it, you're no different, even though you like to pretend you are.\n\n>  I said my piece, disagree if you would like I don't want to get into a big argument about it as it's pointless at this point.\n\nTranslation: I don't have an argument at all so won't bother with it.",

And nobody really wants to align with the subreddit calling for politicians to be hanged, and accusing survivors of a mass shooting of being actors. Is it really that hard for you to grasp why people may not want to work with you guys? I&#39;m pretty sure there was a sticky made by the mods there that showed they were against NN. Not to mention even if we did want to work together, it&#39;s kind of impossible for people on the other side to align with you when being a fanatical Trump supporter is basically a requirement, or you get banned. You don&#39;t get to be shitty to everyone else and then get upset when they decide not to include you. Nothing would have stopped you from speaking up there. Except maybe mods banning you.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Had the some reddit users put aside there differences and encourage T_D to help out,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This goes both ways. There&#39;s a reason you guys are alienated. I wish you were alienated more, to be honest. Your subreddit should just be banned entirely. Your entire post is blaming everyone but your subreddit. This is why you are impossible to work with; you can&#39;t accept any blame, and it&#39;s always someone else&#39;s fault. That and your toxicity, attitudes, and total disregard of facts. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m more than open to a reasonable argument about this. Prove me wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind I do occasionally go on T_D now and then to shitpost but most of the time it&#39;s for laughs. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a T_D user like I said</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Literally what being a TD user is. Also, harassing and doxxing people is your idea of just for laughs? I bet you think sending death threats to the families of kids who died at Parkland is god damn hysterical, huh? If you find the shit they do funny, and contribute to it, you&#39;re no different, even though you like to pretend you are.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I said my piece, disagree if you would like I don&#39;t want to get into a big argument about it as it&#39;s pointless at this point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: I don&#39;t have an argument at all so won&#39;t bother with it.</p>\n</div>",

If we assume our government is in league with Russia in ways we haven&#39;t yet discovered (Aside from POTUS definitely being compromised, possibly a blackmailed asset working for Russia), this FOSTA vote could be a way to control and eliminate smaller internet communities so that the only places to go and discuss things are places like Reddit, Twitter, etc.  Again, these places are proven Russian targets, and they are being HEAVILY targeted.</p>\n\n<p>(EDIT) - As you can see, this post is getting a lot of dissenting replies that fail to understand the point and actively attack it even.  Almost like I struck a nerve with a certain group of people.  The western hemisphere is asleep right now, but it&#39;s 1:13 PM in, you guessed it, Russia.</p>\n</div>",

Section 230 limits the legal liability of interactive computer service providers or users for content they publish that was created by others.\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill amends the federal criminal code to add a new section that imposes penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to 10 years, or both\u2014on a person who uses or operates (or attempts to use or operate) a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.\n\nAdditionally, it establishes enhanced penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to 25 years, or both\u2014for a person who uses or operates a facility of interstate or foreign commerce to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person in one of the following aggravating circumstances: (1) promoting or facilitating the prostitution of five or more persons, or (2) acting with reckless disregard that such conduct contributes to sex trafficking.\n\nA court must order mandatory restitution, in addition to other criminal or civil penalties.\n\nA person injured by an aggravated offense may recover damages and attorneys' fees in a federal civil action.\n\nA defendant may assert, as an affirmative defense, that the promotion or facilitation of prostitution is legal in the jurisdiction where it was targeted.\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit construing section 230 to limit state criminal charges for conduct: (1) that promotes or facilitates prostitution in violation of this bill, or (2) that constitutes child sex trafficking.\n\n(Sec. 5) Additionally, it prohibits construing this bill to limit federal or state civil actions or criminal prosecutions that are not preempted by section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nSo from what I can figure, it adds an exemption from the 230 protections if the content \u201cpromotes or facilitates\u201d prostitution or sex trafficking.
