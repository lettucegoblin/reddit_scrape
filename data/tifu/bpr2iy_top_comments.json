        "body": "**FULL WITH ALL UPDATES**\n\n**This happened an hour ago, and I\u2019m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....\n\nThere\u2019s 2 \u201csituations\u201d that leads to the conclusion of the FU.\n\nFirst situation:\n\nAsked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.\n\nFound out the memory card still had content.\n\nHer husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 \u201cporn\u201d video, assuming sent to him a while back.\n\nI\u2019ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.\n\nA certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.\n\nSo finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\u2019ve always fantasized about, \u201cgifting my past self\u201d, while living my happy current life.\n\nSecond accident:\n\nI have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.\n\nWife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\u2019s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\u2019s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.\n\nLast night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?\n\nI have the day off today, today was the day I\u2019d do the \u201cdeed\u201d. I don\u2019t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.\n\nThis would have lasted me tops 5 mins.\n\nBut the \u201cforeplay\u201d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.\n\nWife\u2019s phone didn\u2019t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.\n\nShe comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.\n\nShe knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.\n\nBut VR porn was never \u201cdiscussed\u201d as an \u201cis it cheating if....\u201d thing. You know the convo I\u2019m talking about, \u201cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if it\u2019s a robot\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\u201d, etc...\n\nIt was the type of convo we\u2019d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\u2019s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\u2019re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.\n\nAnyways, VR wasn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for me to do so. I guess it was \u201cwrong\u201d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That\u2019s when I see her in the room.\n\n\u201cThe fuck??\u201d she says.\n\nThen she looks inside.\n\n\u201cIs that my sister?!?!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fucked.\n\nShe still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.\n\nSeeing from the tracking app... she\u2019s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.\n\nI\u2019m fucked.\n\n**UPDATE**: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that\u2019s when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it\u2019s called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.\n\nI was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.\n\nSo basically... after posting... after feeling a \u201cbit\u201d better by \u201ctelling someone\u201d and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...\n\nThis went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn\u2019t focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying \u201cCall me\u201d.\n\nI left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn\u2019t help as I didn\u2019t focus once on Detective Pikachu.\n\nI received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....\n\nOn the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me \u201cfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it\u201d\n\nArrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....\n\nI get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said \u201csorry\u201d but there was nothing to be \u201csorry\u201d about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I\u2019m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I\u2019m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say \u201csorry\u201d.... but didn\u2019t know how.\n\nWife then says \u201cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\u201d\n\nFucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \u201cknows what?\u201d\n\nShe says \u201cdon\u2019t lie, the video\u201d.\n\nI was red flushed I\u2019m sure. My heart was beating so fast.\n\nThen wife said she has deleted the video.\n\nThis is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....\n\nThen sister-in-law speaks... she says \u201cyou do understand this video wasn\u2019t for you\u201d, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.\n\nBut then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\u2019t for her husband neither. He\u2019s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he\u2019s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\u2019s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.\n\nSister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.\n\nIt was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.\n\nMe obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.\n\nFor tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.\n\nWe will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.\n\nWife seemed ok for now too.\n\nTL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act by wife, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to my life.",

Just get it over with it\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....</p>\n\n<p>I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said \u201csorry\u201d but there was nothing to be \u201csorry\u201d about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I\u2019m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I\u2019m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say \u201csorry\u201d.... but didn\u2019t know how.</p>\n\n<p>Wife then says \u201cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \u201cknows what?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She says \u201cdon\u2019t lie, the video\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I was red flushed I\u2019m sure. My heart was beating so fast.</p>\n\n<p>Then wife said she has deleted the video.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....</p>\n\n<p>Then sister-in-law speaks... she says \u201cyou do understand this video wasn\u2019t for you\u201d, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.</p>\n\n<p>But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\u2019t for her husband neither. He\u2019s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he\u2019s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\u2019s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.</p>\n\n<p>Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.</p>\n\n<p>It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.</p>\n\n<p>Me obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.</p>\n\n<p>For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.</p>\n\n<p>We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.</p>\n\n<p>Wife seemed ok for now too.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act by wife, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to my life.</p>\n</div>",

Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc. \n\nA certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life. \n\nSo finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\u2019ve always fantasized about, \u201cgifting my past self\u201d, while living my happy current life. \n\nSecond accident: \n\nI have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife. \n\nWife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\u2019s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\u2019s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table. \n\nLast night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency? \n\nI have the day off today, today was the day I\u2019d do the \u201cdeed\u201d. I don\u2019t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. \n\nThis would have lasted me tops 5 mins. \n\nBut the \u201cforeplay\u201d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on. \n\nWife\u2019s phone didn\u2019t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone. \n\nShe comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on. \n\nShe knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there. \n\nBut VR porn was never \u201cdiscussed\u201d as an \u201cis it cheating if....\u201d thing. You know the convo I\u2019m talking about, \u201cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if it\u2019s a robot\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\u201d, etc... \n\nIt was the type of convo we\u2019d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\u2019s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\u2019re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way. \n\nAnyways, VR wasn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for me to do so. I guess it was \u201cwrong\u201d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That\u2019s when I see her in the room. \n\n\u201cThe fuck??\u201d she says. \n\nThen she looks inside. \n\n\u201cIs that my sister?!?!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m fucked. \n\nShe still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house. \n\nSeeing from the tracking app... she\u2019s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law. \n\nI\u2019m fucked. \n\nTL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.",

        "body": ">***Edit  by OP (credit to u/***[GizmoCharlie10](https://www.reddit.com/user/GizmoCharlie10)): UPDATE: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that\u2019s when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it\u2019s called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.  \n>  \n>I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.  \n>  \n>So basically... after posting... after feeling a \u201cbit\u201d better by \u201ctelling someone\u201d and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...  \n>  \n>This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn\u2019t focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying \u201cCall me\u201d. I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn\u2019t help as I didn\u2019t focus once on Detective Pikachu.  \n>  \n>I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....  \n>  \n>On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me \u201cfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it\u201d  \n>  \n>Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....  \n>  \n>I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.  \n>  \n>I didn\u2019t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said \u201csorry\u201d but there was nothing to be \u201csorry\u201d about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I\u2019m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I\u2019m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say \u201csorry\u201d.... but didn\u2019t know how.  \n>  \n>Wife then says \u201cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\u201d  \n>  \n>Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \u201cknows what?\u201d  \n>  \n>She says \u201cdon\u2019t lie, the video\u201d.  \n>  \n>I was red flushed I\u2019m sure. My heart was beating so fast.  \n>  \n>Then wife said she has deleted the video.  \n>  \n>This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....  \n>  \n>Then sister-in-law speaks... she says \u201cyou do understand this video wasn\u2019t for you\u201d, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.  \n>  \n>But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\u2019t for her husband neither. He\u2019s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he\u2019s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\u2019s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.  \n>  \n>Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.  \n>  \n>It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.  \n>  \n>Me obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.  \n>  \n>For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.  \n>  \n>We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  \n>  \n>Wife seemed ok for now too.  \n>  \n>Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.  \n>  \n>***Edit By OP's Wife:*** This is his now ex-wife.  \n>  \n>Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve removed all of this personal story for my family\u2019s protection and changed this account\u2019s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.  \n>  \n>I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!  \n>  \n>I\u2019m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.  \n>  \n>I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.  \n>  \n>Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn\u2019t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn\u2019t \u201cfun camping\u201d or a \u201cpicnic\u201d.  \n>  \n>This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.  \n>  \n>I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.  \n>  \n>I\u2019m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.  \n>  \n>Oh, and if you can read this, I\u2019ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.  \n>  \n>TL;DR: His life is ruined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that is how OP was able to achieve singularity in his life.",

I don\u2019t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.  </p>\n\n<p>For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.  </p>\n\n<p>We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  </p>\n\n<p>Wife seemed ok for now too.  </p>\n\n<p>Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Edit By OP&#39;s Wife:</em></strong> This is his now ex-wife.  </p>\n\n<p>Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve removed all of this personal story for my family\u2019s protection and changed this account\u2019s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.  </p>\n\n<p>I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.  </p>\n\n<p>I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.  </p>\n\n<p>Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn\u2019t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn\u2019t \u201cfun camping\u201d or a \u201cpicnic\u201d.  </p>\n\n<p>This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.  </p>\n\n<p>I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.  </p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you can read this, I\u2019ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.  </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: His life is ruined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And that is how OP was able to achieve singularity in his life.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "This happened an hour ago, and I\u2019m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on.... \n\nThere\u2019s 2 \u201csituations\u201d that leads to the conclusion of the FU. \n\nFirst situation: \n\nAsked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to. \n\nFound out the memory card still had content. \n\nHer husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 \u201cporn\u201d video, assuming sent to him a while back. \n\nI\u2019ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc. \n\nA certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life. \n\nSo finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\u2019ve always fantasized about, \u201cgifting my past self\u201d, while living my happy current life. \n\nSecond accident: \n\nI have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife. \n\nWife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\u2019s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\u2019s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table. \n\nLast night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency? \n\nI have the day off today, today was the day I\u2019d do the \u201cdeed\u201d. I don\u2019t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. \n\nThis would have lasted me tops 5 mins. \n\nBut the \u201cforeplay\u201d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on. \n\nWife\u2019s phone didn\u2019t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone. \n\nShe comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on. \n\nShe knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there. \n\nBut VR porn was never \u201cdiscussed\u201d as an \u201cis it cheating if....\u201d thing. You know the convo I\u2019m talking about, \u201cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if it\u2019s a robot\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\u201d, etc... \n\nIt was the type of convo we\u2019d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\u2019s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\u2019re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way. \n\nAnyways, VR wasn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for me to do so. I guess it was \u201cwrong\u201d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face.

So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house. \n\nSeeing from the tracking app... she\u2019s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law. \n\nI\u2019m fucked. \n\nTL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nJust in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This happened an hour ago, and I\u2019m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on.... </p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s 2 \u201csituations\u201d that leads to the conclusion of the FU. </p>\n\n<p>First situation: </p>\n\n<p>Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to. </p>\n\n<p>Found out the memory card still had content. </p>\n\n<p>Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 \u201cporn\u201d video, assuming sent to him a while back. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc. </p>\n\n<p>A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life. </p>\n\n<p>So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\u2019ve always fantasized about, \u201cgifting my past self\u201d, while living my happy current life. </p>\n\n<p>Second accident: </p>\n\n<p>I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife. </p>\n\n<p>Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\u2019s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\u2019s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table. </p>\n\n<p>Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency? </p>\n\n<p>I have the day off today, today was the day I\u2019d do the \u201cdeed\u201d. I don\u2019t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. </p>\n\n<p>This would have lasted me tops 5 mins. </p>\n\n<p>But the \u201cforeplay\u201d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on. </p>\n\n<p>Wife\u2019s phone didn\u2019t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone. </p>\n\n<p>She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on. </p>\n\n<p>She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there. </p>\n\n<p>But VR porn was never \u201cdiscussed\u201d as an \u201cis it cheating if....\u201d thing. You know the convo I\u2019m talking about, \u201cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if it\u2019s a robot\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\u201d, etc... </p>\n\n<p>It was the type of convo we\u2019d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\u2019s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\u2019re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, VR wasn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for me to do so. I guess it was \u201cwrong\u201d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That\u2019s when I see her in the room. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe fuck??\u201d she says. </p>\n\n<p>Then she looks inside. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs that my sister?!?!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m fucked. </p>\n\n<p>She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing from the tracking app... she\u2019s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m fucked. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.</p>\n</div>",

Some people asked about the app, it\u2019s called  Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low  or when phone is back on.  \n>  \n>I was  already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification  appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents  house before posting.  \n>  \n>So basically...  after posting... after feeling a \u201cbit\u201d better by \u201ctelling someone\u201d and  having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the  apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying  her phone was busy...  \n>  \n>This went on for  45 mins, or forever, couldn\u2019t focus on the time. All of a sudden the  sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She  called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave  up. Then just a text saying \u201cCall me\u201d.  \n>  \n>I  left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre,  needed to get distracted, which didn\u2019t help as I didn\u2019t focus once on  Detective Pikachu.  \n>  \n>I received a call  from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple  Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She  only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left  the theatre and decided to go back home....  \n>  \n>On  the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was  petrified... but my out of body experience just told me \u201cfuck it, suck  it up. Just get it over with it\u201d  \n>  \n>Arrived  home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out  of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the  door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was  back....  \n>  \n>I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.  \n>  \n>I  didn\u2019t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said  \u201csorry\u201d but there was nothing to be \u201csorry\u201d about? At this point I was  trying to gauge the mood. I\u2019m not for confrontations or leading  conversations, I\u2019m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to  say \u201csorry\u201d.... but didn\u2019t know how.  \n>  \n>Wife then says \u201cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\u201d  \n>  \n>Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \u201cknows what?\u201d  \n>  \n>She says \u201cdon\u2019t lie, the video\u201d.  \n>  \n>I was red flushed I\u2019m sure. My heart was beating so fast.  \n>  \n>Then wife said she has deleted the video.  \n>  \n>This  is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost  crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was  really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but  no....  \n>  \n>Then sister-in-law speaks... she  says \u201cyou do understand this video wasn\u2019t for you\u201d, then she goes on  for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept  nodding.  \n>  \n>But then this drama comes out  that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\u2019t for her husband neither.  He\u2019s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he  could for work, but also through the years he\u2019s been having an affair  with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while  and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the  providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her  sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid  dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\u2019s not the  first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me  because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her  husband as he does not know about this video.  \n>  \n>Sister-in-law  is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor  now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone  long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls  was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if  I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce  process as if SHE was at fault.  \n>  \n>It was a  very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The  focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for  having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely  leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping  more and more at her parents house.  \n>  \n>Me  obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it  was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will  come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and  tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my  wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.  \n>  \n>For  tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got  some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit,  although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling  better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or  kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more  open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could  trust and talk to if she needs.  \n>  \n>We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  \n>  \n>Wife seemed ok for now too.",

But now they told me  because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her  husband as he does not know about this video.  </p>\n\n<p>Sister-in-law  is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor  now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone  long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls  was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if  I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce  process as if SHE was at fault.  </p>\n\n<p>It was a  very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The  focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for  having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely  leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping  more and more at her parents house.  </p>\n\n<p>Me  obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it  was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will  come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and  tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my  wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.  </p>\n\n<p>For  tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got  some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit,  although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling  better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or  kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more  open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could  trust and talk to if she needs.  </p>\n\n<p>We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  </p>\n\n<p>Wife seemed ok for now too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
