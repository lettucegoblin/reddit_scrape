        "body": "Yea, he dodged a bullet here. My x got on my ass for the same thing. Accused me of being gay or bi because I had bromance's with a few best friends (doing the same shit OP does). She didn't trust me when I told her I was 100% sure of my sexuality and I was confident with who I was. She had a problem with me being myself and that was a huge red flag for me. I couldn't give her 100% of my personality without her questioning some aspect of who I was. Unfortunately I stayed in the relationship for 6 months after that, huge mistake. Luckily I got out of it and found someone who loves me for who I am and finds the bromance's cute and funny. Thats who we all deserve in the end.

He had what looked like a nice decorative water wall fountain that was actually a urinal. \n\nBasically an entire stone wall with water pouring down it, it was recycled water with a pump, but when you stepped on a discreetly hidden pedal it would purge the system with fresh water down the drain and inject some antibacterial cleaner into the next cycle. \n\n[Looked something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/0QziwyV.jpg)\n\nEdit: Since this seems to be way more popular than I thought it would be I'm adding some tidbits of info, going solely off memory as this was ten plus years ago and involved people I haven't spoken to in about just as long.\n\nThere were no stones around the base, just a knee high stone wall set out about 8 to 12 inches from the main rear wall. To conserve water since he was the only one using it he flushed it once every couple of days, and it may have been on a timer but could be manually flushed with the pedal. The cleaning solution would neutralize odors and bacteria. I think it was something in the region of 105 liters per flush cycle, so about six to seven standard toilet flushes, which is actually pretty damn impressive. And yes, it was elegantly lit with customizable ambient lighting\n\nTrying to find a company that makes these, but can't find anything. Probably contracted the job through a company that makes wall fountains.\n\nSo yea, rich guy urinal. It's possible if you have $20,000 or so to drop on it.
