So she gave birth in this doctor's basement and then went on with her life afterward. The doctor forged George's birth certificate to say George was born to him and his wife. George did not know he was adopted until his father admitted it on his deathbed. But he did not tell George his mother's name. So in the family there are 4 possible candidates to be George's mother. We have no idea who. Also George is a jackass who started cursing at my Grandma through email after we could only narrow it down to those 4. We no longer correspond with George.

So she gave birth in this doctor&#39;s basement and then went on with her life afterward. The doctor forged George&#39;s birth certificate to say George was born to him and his wife. George did not know he was adopted until his father admitted it on his deathbed. But he did not tell George his mother&#39;s name. So in the family there are 4 possible candidates to be George&#39;s mother. We have no idea who. Also George is a jackass who started cursing at my Grandma through email after we could only narrow it down to those 4. We no longer correspond with George. So to sum it up, we&#39;re happy George is not written onto our family tree.</p>\n</div>",

It brought her to a family she never knew she had, and also brought a lot of questions. </p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr\nMom took DNA test. Found out she has a different father. Both of my grandparents passed away so she had no one to ask questions to until locating her living bio-dad.</p>\n</div>",

And all three kids had different fathers. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways turns out I have an aunt we never knew about. And she even got the birth certificate to prove it! She initially was doing for heath reasons than anything else. It gets cooler because I was able to meet her last month! We had already booked our trip last year and turns out that it\u2019s close to where she lives and frequents! </p>\n\n<p>I think its amazing and while it may rip apart families or leave questions unanswered. It\u2019s pretty cool to meet new family you never knew about. </p>\n</div>",

Doesn't sound too bad, just sad, right? Well here's the thing(s):\n\nTheir perceived inability to find a partner leads to immense, **immense** frustration. This leads to self-hate in many individuals (I am not good enough). In short, they wallow in self-pity. \n\nApart from that, they also tend to blame anyone else for their problem, particularly women (Women don't know what they are missing / what they want / only want money / only want assholes / are dumb). This is usually what people first see when they first come into contact with incel culture: blame women for their own inability to find a partner. In short, they are immensely misogynist.\n\nAnother thing they tend to do is blame feminism and modern cultural shifts, particularly equality between men and women. They believe their chances of finding a partner are diminished because women should not have such freedom, they should act in accordance to their man's will and be loyal to him. In short, they have a backward patriarchal view of family and love. \n\nThey also, fittingly, give men and masculinity all sorts of virtues, like being stronger, more righteous, and of stronger will than women. I personally believe this is made worse in a lot of places of the world where one's masculinity is calculated in how much sex one has (see American high-school series and the like). Anyway, they believe the only right way to get a partner is to be overly masculine (which they usually aren't, see the self-pity part).  In short, they have a very fragile masculinity which they accredit way too much value to.\n\nAll the while, when some overly manly guys *do* \"get girls\" while they don't, those guys are obviously assholes and 'Chads'.\n\nFinally, if my description of masculinity and femininity reminds you of the nazis, you're not far off. A lot of incels dabble in fascist and neo-nazi circles, both irl and on the net, as they have at least some views and beliefs in common. In short, they have fascist tendencies. \n\nSo, to recap, incels are self-hating, misogynist, fascist brats. They think sex is the only thing a man needs to be a man, and being a man is the most important thing ever, and this self-placed goal they can't achieve. \n\nThey are scum, stuck within this vicious circle: they hardcore believe that what you need to do to be a man is get girls. But they can't, and the problem lies with women, who are untrustworthy and need to be kept in line by a strong man. This attitude of wanting to appear strong mixed with their self-imposed frustration makes them downright assholes, and last time I checked being an asshole only works out in getting a girl in their imagination. Still not being able to get a girl, they still don't think they've achieved their only purpose in life: being real men, and the cycle begins anew. Meanwhile, they find friends on the internet and irl and they make a joint effort of convincing each other that the problem lies indeed with women (as well as society ruled by women) in true reddit-fashion echo chambers.\n\nYet I can't help but think this is a problem created by surroundings. I briefly mentioned American high school series, and I do believe there are more examples. You see, in those series, the \"bad guy\" is stereotypically a chad who chats up all the ladies all the time -- fair enough. But then all too often, the story is about our young male hero who is interested in a girl *but can't get her*, and once he does *get her*, then there's the happy ending. It's all about \"getting a girl\", it is as if sex really is the only thing that ever matters to a man, and every man wants to be exactly that kind of man. \n\nIf any young man in the correct age group, who hasn't had a sexual partner yet, reads this: ***don't worry***. First off, sex is nice, but there is more to life, there is more to love, even. Be yourself, show interest in the people around you, have something interesting to tell, and all pieces will fall right on their place. ",

It&#39;s all about &quot;getting a girl&quot;, it is as if sex really is the only thing that ever matters to a man, and every man wants to be exactly that kind of man. </p>\n\n<p>If any young man in the correct age group, who hasn&#39;t had a sexual partner yet, reads this: <strong><em>don&#39;t worry</em></strong>. First off, sex is nice, but there is more to life, there is more to love, even. Be yourself, show interest in the people around you, have something interesting to tell, and all pieces will fall right on their place. </p>\n</div>",

Both groups were made to sit in a room for an hour while loud, disturbing sounds were played, but for one group (the experimental group) the room contained a button which they were told could be pressed at any time to stop the sounds.\n\nEven though no one pressed the button and it wasn't even wired up, they found that the participants from the experimental group were a lot less unsettled after that hour than those from the control group - precisely because they had the *belief* (albeit mistaken) that they could escape the unpleasant situation at any time. It's also why a person scratching their nails down the blackboard is able to tolerate it better than anyone else in the room.\n\nSimilarly, incels are the sorry fuckers who not only don't get any, but have likely tried and been shot down enough times that they're like the control group in the experiment described above - don't believe they have any control over their situation, and therefore are badly affected by it.
