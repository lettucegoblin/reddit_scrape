All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

No Politics\n* Political videos\u2014including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)\u2014should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.\n\n* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.\n\n#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views\n\n* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts\n\n* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. \n\n* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.\n\n* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.\n\n* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.\n\n* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout\n\n#9. No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.\n](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)\n\n#10. No Self Promotion\n\n* *\"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.\"* - Confucius\n\n* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.\n\n\n---\n###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)\n\n#Removals & Warnings\n* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.\n\n* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*\n\n* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. \n\n* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos.

Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval.

Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform.

No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of \"that is next level\" from viewers.\n\n#Use A Descriptive Title\nWrite a clear title for your content that describes the post well. If your title is ill-defined your post may be removed. For example posting CGI content without the mention of it being CGI will result in a removal.\n\n#Avoid Common Reposts\nPosts that have been posted recently to /r/nextfuckinglevel should not be posted repeatedly. If a post has done well on the sub within the past few months it should not be posted again.\n\n#Be Respectful to Others\nTreat others in the subreddit politely and do not troll or harass anyone. This includes slurs and hate speech, which will prompt a ban. We welcome positivity above all.\n\n#Avoid Spam\nDo not post multiple times to this subreddit in a short amount of time. Repeated spam will be moderated.\n\n#Link directly to the content\nYour post (gifs, videos) must be directly linked to the content.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

References through text, balance, snapping, and colour are not accepted. The mod team may make occasional exceptions to this rule at their own discretion.\n\n- Rule 1b. Context cannot be in the title. If the meme caption is in the title or the post makes no sense without the title, it will be removed.\n\n- R-2a. Low effort/quality posts will be removed. This includes unaltered video clips, photos of people coloured purple, etc.\n\n- R-3a. Do not add spoilers in the post title or the post body without a spoiler tag.\n\n- R-3b. The spoiler period lasts 3 weeks after the movie has been released in the theatres.\n\n- R-4. NSFW/NSFL content is not allowed. This includes all nudity regardless of whether genitalia is shown. Breaking this rule will result in an immediate permaban.\n\n- R-5a. Reposts of posts less than 1-month-old will be removed. Please check Hot and New before posting. Crossposting is allowed and encouraged.\n\n- R-5b. Templates are allowed as long as they are not a direct copy/paste of the originals.\n\n- R-6. Follow the Reddit TOS in both posts and comments. Incivility, asking for votes, using Reddit as a marketplace, and brigading will result in an immediate permaban.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101), and visit [/r/Newtoreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) \n\n---\n\n# Rules\n*hover for details*\n\n|||\n|:------|:---|\n|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden. [Read more](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10.3A_no_social_media_or_electronic_messaging_content.).

[Click here!](https://www.reddit.com/user/funny_mod/m/funnyplus)\n\n---\nPlease note:\n\n* Hate speech and bigotry will be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\n* Bots and bot-like accounts are not allowed.\n\n* No link shorteners (or HugeURL) in either post links or comments. They will be deleted regardless of intent.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

You'll also get updates on the meme market, and be able to collaborate with other fellow meme traders analysing the new memes on the block.\n\n*****\n\nThis sub is not ***only*** for templates. It is for memes in general, themed in an economic perspective. Though, this is not a dumping ground for your low effort memes, please refrain from posting them here.\n\n***\n\n###***[Send us your suggestions here!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMemeEconomy)***\n\n###***[Join the new Discord here!](https://discord.gg/MSsVu8E)***\n\n###***[Unsure how to use the Bot? Look here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/wiki/index)***\n\n***\n\n#### [**Rules:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/rules/)\n\nRule|Description\n:-:|:-:\n1. Appraisal Requests|If a post wishes to request investors' opinion of an old template, it must EXPLICITLY state in the title that it is an appraisal request, and flair it as so. Failure to do will be seen as an attempt to post regular memes, and will be immediately removed.\n2. Create Original and Quality Content|MemeEconomy is a subreddit focused on brainstorming/discovering new formats that: * Are versatile * Have some level of quality * Have originality.But posts that do not belong here are those that are:* Spam * Memes that have little to no use * Old, done-to-death memes * Low effort content (e.g. unoriginal templates).Moderators are able to remove low-effort memes subject to their discretion, including overdone formats, which have been oversaturated and their market value is next to nothing.\n3. No Blatant, Direct Reposts|Reposting in the sense that you take a post from another meme subreddit, copy and paste the image to this subreddit and call it a day is **not allowed**.However, if a new template got popular somewhere else on Reddit, and you were to only take the template and **transform it in a good way**, that would be fine, but make sure you give credit to the user who first made the template. Posting old MemeEconomy posts is **also not allowed.**\n4. No Advertising|Instant and *possibly permanent* bans will be dished out for making a post, or a comment out of the blue which its\u2019 only purpose is to promote some form of product, service or person.**We're not Google Ads.**\n5. No Market Manipulation / Alt Accounts|Please respect the economy. Sharing economic exploits, false market information & **anything that gives an unfair advantage over others**, including using alternate accounts to artificially inflate the share price, are crimes that are subject to having your account suspended or in some instances, certain posts will be **suspended from trading**.This is heavily frowned on by the entire community as well as the moderators.\n6. Must Include Template/Example|__**If you posted a template:**__You are required to share a link to an example meme.__**If you posted a meme:**__You are required to share a link to the template.Reply to the bot's sticky comment with, for example, !template https://imgur.com/, to post your template/example. If you fail to share the relevant link in the next hour, **your post may be manually removed!**\n7. Reputable Investors Only|This is a forum for reputable investors. Your account must be **older than 7 days** and have at least **50 comment karma** to post. If your account does not meet these conditions, AutoModerator will automatically remove your post.\n8. Be Civil and Respectful|TToxic behavior towards others **is not** allowed and will be met with a ban. This behavior includes (but is not limited to) *trolling, harassing, bullying, taunting, brigading, threatening, hating, antagonizing, and bothering* other users.This doesn't mean that you should report everyone who has a **different opinion** to you, and being \"ironic\" **doesn't give you the right to say anything.**\n9. No Doxxing/Personal Information|Many Redditors prefer to keep their identity hidden and out of public view. You should always ask for consent, and should not publically leak their information on the subreddit. Posts that defame people with private lives may be subject to removal depending on how severe the mods see it.\n10. Keep NSFW/Offensive Posts To A Minimum|NSFW material or edgy material that is *excessively graphic*, *offensive*, or **that causes widespread division & controversy** is subject to removal. Memes that try to faciliate Nazi/alt-right views will be removed (e.g. StoneToss comics).Examples of NSFW posts are memes that may or may not depict sex or nudity excessively, or those that have excessive violence or gore. Examples of edgy memes are those that glorify hate such as KKK or Nazi memes, and any other bigotry.\n11.Think, Talk & Post Economically|We'd ideally like you to post original content and keep the title economics-related. This **is** a subreddit for discussing the meme economy, after all.

        "subreddit_description": "*Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It\u2019s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\u2019s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)\n\n---\n###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) \n\n#1. Videos Only\n* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.\n\n*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos\n\n#2. No Politics\n* Political videos\u2014including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)\u2014should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5. No Porn, Gore, or Death.\n\n* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.\n\n#6. No Solicitation of Votes or Views\n\n* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts\n\n* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. \n\n* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.\n\n* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.\n\n* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.\n\n* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout\n\n#9. No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.\n](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)\n\n#10. No Self Promotion\n\n* *\"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.\"* - Confucius\n\n* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.\n\n\n---\n###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)\n\n#Removals & Warnings\n* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking).

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules).

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed.

Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* \n * Do not post GIFs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to GIF formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. \n\n **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  \n **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**\n\n Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.\n\n2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)\n\n3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  \u2020**\n\n4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!\n\n5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.\n\n6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. \n\n7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqu\u00e9 posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)\n\n8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof.

No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

(See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of \"that is next level\" from viewers.\n\n#Use A Descriptive Title\nWrite a clear title for your content that describes the post well. If your title is ill-defined your post may be removed. For example posting CGI content without the mention of it being CGI will result in a removal.\n\n#Avoid Common Reposts\nPosts that have been posted recently to /r/nextfuckinglevel should not be posted repeatedly. If a post has done well on the sub within the past few months it should not be posted again.\n\n#Be Respectful to Others\nTreat others in the subreddit politely and do not troll or harass anyone. This includes slurs and hate speech, which will prompt a ban. We welcome positivity above all.\n\n#Avoid Spam\nDo not post multiple times to this subreddit in a short amount of time. Repeated spam will be moderated.\n\n#Link directly to the content\nYour post (gifs, videos) must be directly linked to the content. Redirecting links are not allowed and your post will be removed.\n\n___\n\n*Do not police or gatekeep the content of this sub (debate what is or is not next fucking level) in the comment section; 100% of the content is moderated.*",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.\n\n*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos\n\n#2. No Politics\n* Political videos\u2014including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)\u2014should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#3. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5.

See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8.

No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed.

Most submissions do not make the cut, so please do not treat removals under Rule 2 as personal attacks: They are simply the results of our content model.\n\n[](/starlightrage)\n##See something that breaks our rules?  \n\n###Use the report button and remember to choose a reason for reporting.\n\n---\n     \n### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**\n\n|||\n|:------|:-----|\n|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the \u201csuggest title\u201d option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|\n|2. Submit only if \u201cOniony\u201d. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be \"Oniony\". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|\n|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|\n|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|\n|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it\u2019s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|\n|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|\n|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|\n|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|\n|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|\n|10. No mobile versions. | If you\u2019re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically \u201c.m\u201d or \u201cmobile\u201d) from the url before submitting.|\n|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren\u2019t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|\n\n[](/sunburstnervous) **[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval) to view a list of sites deemed unreliable by our moderator team.**\n\n###See [our FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/nto101) for more information on our rules. \n____\n\n###Keep all comments civil.\n\n[](/twirage) Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, grandstanding, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc. will not be tolerated and ***you will be banned***.\n\n[Witch hunting or brigading is not allowed.

Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101), and visit [/r/Newtoreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) \n\n---\n\n# Rules\n*hover for details*\n\n|||\n|:------|:---|\n|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules).

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

No hate speech. No posts about how different Pearl is from her father.\n\n3. **Do not put the punchline in the title of the post.**\n Having a funny picture of a Bikini Bottom resident and using the title as the punchline *does not make your post a meme.*\n\n4. **Do not post *really* low-effort memes.**\nUsing excessively overdone and/or outdated templates, posting something that is excruciatingly unfunny, begging for upvotes, *cake days posts*, posting something that simply doesn't make any sense... you get the idea.\n\n6. **No spamming.** More than 4 posts in 24 hours is considered spam.\n\n6. **The mods reserve the right to take any action (which includes banning users and removing comments) that they feel improves the overall quality of this subreddit.**\nOur most basic duty as mods is to keep this sub clean of any bullshit.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.*\n\n\n## RULES:\n**1. NO METAGAMING**\n\n**2. DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE**\n\n**3. POSTS MUST BE MEMES OF THE STAR WARS PREQUELS.**\n\n**4. POSTS INAPPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING IN PUBLIC, LIKE AT WORK, MUST BE TAGGED NSFW.**\n\n**5. NO POLITICS.**\n\n**6. NO EDGY OR INFLAMMATORY POSTS.**\n\n**7. NO BRIGADING/ENCOURAGING BRIGADING.**\n\n**8. NO ENCOURAGING SUBREDDIT DRAMA.**\n\n**9. NO ANNOYING BOTS OR NOVELTY ACCOUNTS**\n\n**10. NO SHORT-TERM REPOSTS**\n\n**11. NO LOW-EFFORT POSTS**\n\n**12. NO PROMOTION**\n\n**13. NO MISINFORMATION**\n\n**14. NO SPAM**\n\n##DETAILS:\n\n1. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who \u201cstarted it\u201d when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made from prequel-content or about prequel content.\n\n4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start \u201cmeme wars\u201d, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit\u2019s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\nPosts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\nIt also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted\n\nAll reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\nOP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don\u2019t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn\u2019t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the \u201cI love democracy\u201d macro slapped below it.\n\n12. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although there are exceptions\n\n13. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.",

News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n> 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n7. **[Cite Sources.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_7._cite_sources)** - If your comic is a direct adaptation of an existing joke, tweet, post or meme, please cite the original source in the comments.\n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n> * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n> * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n> Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n> &nbsp;\n    \n> [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n> * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)",

The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!\n\n\n---\n\n#####Discord Server\n\nr/DunderMifflin now has a Discord Server. [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/dundermifflin) and discuss the show!\n\n---\n#####Rules\n\n####1) Be Civil\n\nDon't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. \n\n####2) No spam/Low-effort posts\n\nKeep posts directly related to TV show \"The Office\". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk). Memes/images from social media will also likely be removed as they're 99% reposts.\n\n####3) No piracy\n\nDon't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.\n\n####4) No politics\n\nNo posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. This includes posts mentioning/comparing something or someone from the show to a political figure, or anything you saw at a protest/strike/rally.\n\n####5) No cake-day posts/asking for karma\n\nCake day posts are forbidden unless they are high-effort OC. \n\n####6) Image hosting\n\nImages, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.\n\n####7) Self-Promotion\n\nThe promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.\n\n####8) No Merchandise\nPosts that are about items of merchandise (\"look at this cool shirt\", \"I found this board game\", \"I made Cards Against The Office\") are prohibited without prior mod approval.\n\n####9) No New Spoilers\nActors from The Office may feature in new media and franchises. Though it may be tempting to discuss their new roles, feeling like this is a safe community to do so: it isn't. This subreddit is for The Office only. If you make a post or comment that spoils new content (within reason, like for a major franchise) in other \"cinematic universes\", the post will be removed, and you may receive a ban.\n\n[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)\n\n#####Guidelines:\n\n####Reposts\n\nPlease do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.\n\nRecent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.\n\n####Stay relevant\n\nMake sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image. If you have to give it a The Office title to make it relevant, it's not worth posting.\n\n####Is your post low effort?\n\nThe following types of posts are low effort and will be removed:\n\n* Pictures of your TV screen (especially \"are you still watching\" netflix screens)\n* Photos of small wall-mounted TV screens\n* AI-generated scripts, scenes, quotes, etc.\n* Actors in other TV shows\n* IRL sightings of names related to the show.\n* George Foreman grills\n* Photos of Randall Park (Asian Jim) making a joke about how it's actually Jim\n* Screenshots of the show with nothing else added to them\n* Any post with an especially shitty title\n\n[More examples here of low effort posts](https://redd.it/95w3xk)\n\n####Unexpectedoffice\n\nScreenshots of Reddit/social media comments referencing the show should be posted to /r/unexpectedoffice instead.\n\n#### Bots\nBots and novelty accounts, as determined by the mods in their sole discretion, are subject to arbitrary bans.\n\n---\n\n#####Related subreddits\n\n* /r/unexpectedoffice\n\n* /r/Schruteprotips\n\n* /r/creedthoughts\n\n* /r/tobyistheworst\n\n* /r/TelevisionQuotes\n\n* /r/SnapChatTheOffice \n\n#####The Office Resouces\n\n* [The Office on Wiki](http://bit.ly/n3spL)",

No memes \n> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n> ### 2. No related posts\n> Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n> ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here.

Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101), and visit [/r/Newtoreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/) \n\n---\n\n# Rules\n*hover for details*\n\n|||\n|:------|:---|\n|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed (use /r/Nsfwfunny). Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#4. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#5.

See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#7. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#8.

If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams.

No Self Promotion\n\n* *\"It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.\"* - Confucius\n\n* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.\n\n\n---\n###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)\n\n#Removals & Warnings\n* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking).

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3.

Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed.

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed.

This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

Not entirely in keeping with the general theme: spatially-situated freakouts occurring in person and in public\n\n**[Repost]** - While they have their place, avoid making these submissions consistently\n\n**[Follow Up]**- A news article or other report which follows up on a video that was previously posted to the subreddit. Please include a link to the original freakout if possible. \n\n**[Protest Freakout]** - Videos of Protests and the Freakouts that occur during the protest.\n\n**[Compilation]** - A compilation of freakouts\n\n**[Possibly Fake]** - Might have been staged\n\n##Avoid:\n\n**[Fake]** - Staged freakouts\n\n**[Non-Public]** - Non-public freakouts\n\n**[Non-Freakout]** - Submissions that are not freakouts\n\n##Filters:\n\n[Filter out submissions with 'Protest Freakout' flair/tag.\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=NOT+flair%3A%22Protest+Freakout%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\n[Filter out submissions with 'Super Bowl Freakout' flair/tag.\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=NOT+flair%3A%22Super+Bowl+Freakout%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\n[Filter out submissions with 'Repost' flair/tag.\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=NOT+flair%3A%22Repost%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\n[Filter out submissions with '\ud83c\udf0e World Events' flair/tag.\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=NOT+flair%3A\ud83c\udf0e%2BWorld%2BEvents&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\n##Shout Outs:\n\n* [Hotwheels aka Fredrick Brennan of (8chan)](https://imgur.com/a/kBEF4Xw)\n\n* [John Mayer](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/b5g6yg/meta_john_mayer_shouts_out_this_sub/)\n\n##In the News:\n\n[Fox News reports on comments within /r/publicfreakout](http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2018/06/27/bart-rider-calls-cops-on-passenger-for-dining-on-burrito-in-viral-video.html?message-to-seo-guy-at-FOX-News=We-come-in-peace-from-reddit.com/r/publicfreakout-you-write-about-us-we-link-back-to-you) - [The discussion reported on](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/8tddfe/man_on_bart_calls_for_police_to_report_another/)\n\n[rare.us article\n](https://rare.us/rare-news/caught-on-video/complete-stranger-goes-off-the-rails-after-seeing-a-couple-kiss-in-public-im-from-california-go-back-to-whatever/)\n\n[Know Your Meme's page about Public Freakout](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/public-freakout-videos)\n\n[Vice Article](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-internet-is-losing-its-shit-over-moms-losing-their-shit-at-skate-parks) about /r/publicfreakout and /r/skateparkfreakout\n\n## Like it here?

In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

If a post has done well on the sub within the past few months it should not be posted again.\n\n#Be Respectful to Others\nTreat others in the subreddit politely and do not troll or harass anyone.

No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you\u2026\" or \"When they\u2026\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators\u2019 discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no \u201cCake Day\u201d posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7.

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10.

Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

This can be due to greed, apathy, laziness or just downright scumbaggery. \n\nCheck out /r/Clickshaming and /r/AntiAssholeDesign as well!\n\n---\n\n###Rules\n\n\n#####`1.` ***[Must Abide by Hanlon's Razor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)***\n> *\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\"*\n\n> Usually, bad things happen not because of bad intentions, but because of bad planning. Asshole designs are specifically engineered to exploit the user for profit. Try to think what the designer would gain from deceiving the user, and if it's likely to be an oversight on their part rather than an intentional design. For common topics that fall under this rule, check our wiki.\n\n> https://reddit.com/r/assholedesign/wiki/hanlonsrazor\n\n#####`2.` **No, It's Not Literal.** \n> *\"Haha, so it's like an actual asshole in r/AssholeDesign, right?\"* STOP! Don't post dicks or butts to this sub. You're not being clever. The joke is dead. **This rule is strictly enforced,** and breaking it will lead to an immediate 7-day ban.\n\n#####`3.` **Don't be Subtle.**\n> Please make it obvious what you\u2019re trying to highlight. A clear and concise post title can go a long way.\n\n> If this is the reason why your post was removed, we don't know what we're supposed to be seeing.\n\n#####`4.` **Common topics.** \n> To keep the subreddit's content fresh, we remove common topics and designs that have recently been posted by other users. For a list of retired topics that fall under this rule, check our wiki.\n\n> https://reddit.com/r/assholedesign/wiki/common_topics \n\n#####`5.` **Posts must display aspects of design.**\n> If your post doesn't talk about the way something is designed, don't post it here.\n\n#####`6.` **No low effort content.** \n> Please put some thought into your post and how you present the \"asshole design\" in it. Also, make sure your title is relevant to the post and descriptive of the design. Make it easy to read, don't make it overly lengthy.\n\n\n___\n\n###Guidelines\n\n#####`1.` **We're not limited to programming.** \n> Asshole design goes beyond the computer screen. Some of our best posts have been from non-technical stuff.\n\n#####`2.` **You can post positive things, too!** \n> Informational videos demonstrating malicious techniques, resources for combating assholedesign, etc. are all completely acceptable.\n\n#####`3.` **Satire and Lampshade Hanging is acceptable if tagged appropriately**. \n> Satire is ridicule of asshole design techniques, and should be tagged under the \"Satire\" flair. Lampshade Hanging is subversion of asshole design techniques and should be tagged under \"Lampshading\". \n\n#####`4.` **Bots & novelty accounts are subject to arbitrary bans.** \n> Some users have issued concerns regarding certain bots and their use as a constructive part of Reddit. Some bots might be banned, others may be allowed to stay. This rule will be enforced on a case-by case basis.\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)",

Failure to provide the photographers name or the original source of the image can result in a ban. \n\n###### A single image\nAlbums may be posted in the comments.\nPanoramas, Image Stacks, Composites, and images edited via Photoshop or similar software are allowed.\n\n###### An image featuring a natural landscape\nImages must have visible land. Images with humans, machines, boats, roads, airplanes, farms, animals, buildings, or other human-made objects in them [will be removed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_what_types_of_images_are_allowed.3F)\n\n###### An unsilhouetted image\nImages where details in the landscape are not visible due to silhouetting will be removed.\n\n###### No photos taken illegally\nThis includes flying your drone in a no-fly zone. Please respect local laws and access closures!\n\n\n###### **Title Requirements:**\nYou submission title must contain the following:\n\n###### The location of the area in the photo.\nWhen it comes to location, the more specific the better. If you wish to not disclose the location you should at the very least name the state/country. Rule of thumb for naming only the location (e.g. a lake, mountain): if one can find the place immediately by searching it in google it's fine. For possibly ambiguous locations add state/country for safety.\n\n###### The resolution of the image in pixel format.\nFor example, an image taken on an iPhone 6 would have a resolution of [3264x2448]\n\n###### The photographers name.\nIf you took the photo use [OC]. OC submitters will be reward with different camera flairs based on number of OC submissions.\n\n###### Do not include your device name in the title.\nFeel free to add photography details such as camera, lens, and settings, as a comment.\n\n###### Do not ask for upvotes in your title.\nA complete list of subreddit rules are found in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index)\n\n---\n\n###### **Comment Rules:**\n\nHate Speech, Abusive remarks, homophobia, and the like have no place on this subreddit, and will be removed on sight.\n\nPlease contribute to the discussion positively; constructive criticism is fine, but if you don't like a picture and you wish to voice your opinion please refrain from abusing the photographer/submitter.\n\n---\n\n###### **Other important rules:**\n\nEarthPorn is not a catch-all subreddit. Images that are submitted here are individually reviewed for compliance with our subreddit rules. If your submission is removed, a moderator should advise which of our network of SFWPorn subreddits would be a more appropriate place to submit.\n\n* Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to \"fix\" the colors of an image or remove a watermark.\n* Non-OC submissions are restricted to [one per day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2pd9kj/a_small_rule_change_for_earthporn/)**\n* Regarding reposts: [Submissions are considered reposts if they have been submitted in the last 2 years or if they have received more than 20,000 karma when they were previously submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/rkyp98/rules_update_for_2022/) \n* Circlejerky/sandbagging/pandering titles may be removed.\n* If you have any questions check out the [**wiki**](/r/EarthPorn/wiki/).\n* Breaking multiple rules will result in a ban.\n\n----\n\n######**[Follow us on Twitter!](http://twitter.com/sfwpearth)**\n\n-----\n\n**Other subreddits you may enjoy:**\n\n* /r/AmateurEarthPorn\n* /r/AmateurPhotography\n* /r/beerwithaview\n* /r/CampingandHiking\n* /r/EarthPornGifs \n* /r/IncredibleIndia\n* /r/ITookAPicture\n* /r/JoshuaTree\n* /r/Nature\n* /r/NatureGifs\n* /r/NaturePics\n* /r/natureporn/\n* /r/SpecArt \n* /r/telephotolandscapes **< new and cool**\n* /r/rwallpaperchanger\n\n---\n\n[National Photography Subreddits Network](http://goo.gl/fzLyGl) - photography from around the world",

Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**\n\n-----\n> ### 1. No memes \n> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n> ### 2. No related posts\n> Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n> ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n> ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n> **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n> **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n> **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n> **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n> ###5. No screenshots\n\n> No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0), ;P, \ud83d\ude1c, \u2764, \u2605, \u273f )\n\n> *Still confused?

Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of \"that is next level\" from viewers.\n\n#Use A Descriptive Title\nWrite a clear title for your content that describes the post well. If your title is ill-defined your post may be removed.

Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.
