SpaceX has plans to also sell satellites that use the same satellite bus and these satellites that may be used for scientific or exploratory purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Development began in 2015, initial prototype test-flight satellites are expected to be flown in 2018, and initial operation of the constellation could begin as early as 2019 to 2020. The SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington, houses the research and development operations for the satellite internet project.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup>[</sup> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space\"><sup>PM</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme\"><sup>Exclude</sup> <sup>me</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/space/about/banned\"><sup>Exclude</sup> <sup>from</sup> <sup>subreddit</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index\"><sup>FAQ</sup> <sup>/</sup> <sup>Information</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot\"><sup>Source</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate\"><sup>Donate</sup></a>   <sup>]</sup>\n<sup>Downvote</sup> <sup>to</sup> <sup>remove</sup> <sup>|</sup> <sup>v0.28</sup></p>\n</div>",
