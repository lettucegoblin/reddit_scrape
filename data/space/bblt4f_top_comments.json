        "body": "Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the \"point of no return\" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than \"it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,\" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: if you really want to get into the details, [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205) is the journal released today by *Astrophysical Letters* with all the papers!  And it appears to be open access!\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.",

The simulations used to make these predictions relied on GRMHD - general-relativistic magneto-hydro-dynamics. This in an incredibly complex and difficult area of physics, far beyond general relativity on its own. Think of the simulations that manufacturing companies have to make using fluid dynamics for e.g. air flow around airplanes and cars. Dealing with the basic properties of a fluid such as its mass, compression, and temperature is difficult enough to require supercomputers *on its own, in constant gravity.* Now add magnetic fields and their interplay with the fluid. Then add self-attraction and variable gravity. *Then* add general relativity, with space-time, a moving and curving frame of reference which interplays with all of the above dynamically and non-linearly. It is simply astonishing that the outcome matches reality *at all.* This is by far the most extreme test of our understanding of GRMHD to date. It gives us a ton of confidence that the assumptions and simplifications that we make to even be able to run the models at all... are actually very correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, there's the ability of black holes to drive jets. These jets have been observed directly in many galaxies including M87 but the physics behind their ejection is very debated. How does the direction of black hole 'feeding' relate to the largest, galaxy-scales of jets? How do they vary in time? Which part of the structure around the black hole launches the jets? With an image, a disc size, and time-variability (or lack thereof) we can suddenly build models with a lot fewer assumptions. Plus, our confidence in GRMHD is now a lot higher, and jet-launching is a deeply related to the magnetic fields around the event horizon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have now reached the final scale in the study of quasars, after detecting inter-galactic jets, effects on the host galaxy, central velocity effects on stars, gas feeding reservoirs, and now the event horizon itself!

This is the best possible resolution you can get of this particular black hole with a dish effectively the size of earth due to the limits of angular resolution. To get a higher resolution image there are three options.\n\nOption one, you need an array of radio telescopes that are wider apart than Earth, and not just in low earth orbit either because that doesn't achieve anything significant. Lagrange points or elsewhere, doesn't really matter because that is an insane undertaking in terms of engineering and in funding and there are orders of magnitude better ways to fund science than doing that. Its not happening any time soon. If humans exist for millennia this will almost certainly be possible though.\n\nThe second option is to find a black hole that is closer. I have no idea what the likelihood of that is or the reasoning of looking at the one they did, but I'm gonna assume if that was an option then that's what we'd be seeing today. I doubt they chose such a distant black hole just for the fun of it if there was an easier one to image.\n\nThe third option and the thing we did with the planets of our solar system is to send a probe then beam the image back. This thing is 50 million+ light years away, so a round trip (probe there, data back) even with a lightspeed probe is 100 million years. Although of course if we were gonna do that, we could go to a nearer black hole (super-massive or not). Either way, our nearest black hole which Google says is 3000LY away is still totally not on the cards, and even if it was...minimum 6000 years to get the results back, eek. The furthest out we've gone is with Voyager 1, at 0.002 lightyears away, and was launched 42 years ago. You can see that we're not even slightly close on that front to reaching even the perfect goal of 6000 years (wormholes not included).\n\nUnless anyone can think of any other way? Don't get me wrong I'd love to see it, but seems like we are hard limited by the laws of physics on this one.",

So objects moving through these pockets of space-time that are warped have to experience time differently as well.\n\nSo imagine time like an object. If the object moves through a vacuum it experiences no dilation, but if you add stuff to the vacuum (like water) the object will interact and slow down. Just like objects through water, time through gravity has to push through more warped space just to end up at the same place.  Because of this, the closer you are to another object the more it's gravity has an effect on time experienced by you. So if you were orbiting a black hole, the warping of space is so great that a couple moments for you could translate to a timescale of years depending on orbit.\n\nAt least this is my monkey-brained understanding of it.
