They tried to get me and my friend to snitch to get out of jail to which we told them to go fuck themselves and do their job because i pay there paychecks with my tax payer dollars. Needless to say they pushed the sentence to the judge and they won't budge. Ive been clean for a year, took my own pee tests, joined NA got into an apprenticeship, got my GED, and have been care taking for my family during covid and they still don't give a fuck.
