With other health problems and the amount she works it's likely to get worse so fuck me I guess.

Obviously they pick the first one because they care too much about making another billion than being a decent human being and actually giving a shit about whether people live or die.\n\nWe didnt deserve this! My mother doesnt deserve this! But because we got the short end of the stick we can suffer?! \"Oh it's because you haven't worked hard enough to achieve your dreams\" is complete BS! How is it her fault that after working hard her whole life she got screwed over by a husband who left her and their four kids to go to another state, only to drop by every month or so?! The answer is she doesnt but the American system is too fucked to care about people who need others to help them!\n\nDont get me wrong, I dont expect it to change anytime soon.

Doesn\u2019t all health insurance have a maximum out of pocket expense limit per year? Mine always has since I started working and having my own insurance 15 years ago, including when I had free health insurance while working at Starbucks and Whole Foods through college. Isn\u2019t that the whole point of health insurance? It\u2019s always been $2k-3k for me. Right now mine is $2500 so even if the brain surgery I\u2019m about to have costs $100k, I\u2019m only going to have to pay an additional $1500 because I\u2019ve already spent $1000 this year on copays and a $600 MRI. \n\nAm I missing something?  Why would it bankrupt them if they have insurance?  Does health insurance exist with no maximum out of pocket amount? If so, why would you ever choose that plan when you\u2019re a successful family like OP makes themselves out to be? That\u2019s putting all your wealth in jeopardy if a health issue arises and all humans eventually have health issues. \n\nFurthermore, I had a different surgery 5 years ago and it also pegged my maximum out of pocket so I owed the hospital $2300. I didn\u2019t pay that shit at all and they just sent the bill over and over for years. It\u2019s not like they forcibly take the money from you. Eventually they offered a payment plan of $50 per month with zero interest or late fee (even though I make good money). I said sure and didn\u2019t pay that shit either. I still owe the same hospital $2300 to this day and they\u2019re still doing my brain surgery in a few weeks. So why would OP just cave and hand over their life savings?  Seems like an intelligence problem rather than a financial one.",

Also if they both have degrees but still have an insurance that won\u2019t cover cancer treatment? Gonna get downvoted for this but get a degree in a lucrative field and don\u2019t get the lowest teir insurance. That\u2019s the hard truth and if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s your choice. </p>\n\n<p>I feel terrible for them if it\u2019s true but if you\u2019re going bankrupt with 20 years of savings of two people with college degrees, you haven\u2019t been saving that much.</p>\n</div>",
