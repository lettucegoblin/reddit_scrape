And i CANT \"like it or leave\" because no one lets felons immigrate and i had a \"different\" youth than most- way different than is even possible today w/ all the checks and the cameras and social media and shit, like the 90s were the wild west of making money lowkey- and PLUS AMERICA IS NOW ON CIVIL RIGHTS WATCHLISTS AND MANY COUNTRIES IN 1ST WORLD (which i HAVE TO stay in for medical reasons) DONT ACCEPT AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS UNLESS THEYRE RICH- AND THEY NEVER ACCEPT FELONS EVEN IF WE FROM WERENT FROM RACIST DICKHEAD AMERICA. Took 18 years to get caught but now im a free disabled citizen and have \"paid my debt\"- so until someone actually fixes me, and as theyre still getting 80%- STFU AND GO AWAY OR FIX MY DAMN STOMACH!!! And like i said- if i could leave to any other \"1st world\" counties i would have- like decades ago BTW!!! (for all you \"love it or leave it\" folks)",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I disabled and broke, have SSDI and Medicare, and even though I&#39;m only 43 owe literally 100s of Ks totaled to DRS/HOSPITALS around the country, and THATS AFTER MEDICARE GAVE THEM 80% OF THE BILL, WHILE DOING NOTHING GO FIX MY CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES- I LIVE OFF SSDI- THEY SHOULD KEEP THEIR 80% AND STFU BECAUSE THEY ARENT GETTING A CENT FROM UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING- AND THEY WANT ALMOST A \u00bd MILLION FROM ME, AND THATS 20%, THEY ALREADY GOT $4.5 MILLION FROM Medicare, SO THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH EAT A DICK if they think im EVER giving a dime- i mean im DISABLED ENOUGH THEYVE FORGIVEN MY STUDENT FUCKING LOANS in full and im 43- AND THEYVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP ME OVER 20 YEARS EXCEPT SENDING BILLS- IM STILL IN THE SAME STATE/HAVE SAME PROBLEM IT&#39;S JUST GETTING WORSE- THEYVE HELPED NONE- SO THEY SHOULD TAKE THEIR $4.5M THEY GOT FROM MEDICARE AND FUCK OFF- cause they cant take my cash for hospital bills (check that if you think im lying- as long as you give them $5 a month they have to leave you alone- hospal bills AREN&#39;T LIKE credit card debt or mortgages- they will NEVER garnish you wages for hospital bills)- 43, owe hundreds of thousands and THEY CANT DO SHIT! it not a &quot;real bill&quot; like you have to pay in full like you mortgage or car payment. Just fucking saying. And maybe thats because my &#39;credit&#39; sux already anyway- like can you believe they actually give degenerates me who owe obscene amounts of money to hospitals and Drs in like 7 states- and they STILL GIVE ME CREDIT CARDS? Which are a trap to make you owe more money do so I dont actually use them- i use my debit card cause if i dont have the money for some shit- i do w/o it. Like dont do 9-5s, never have- but i keep my shit in cash just in case- dont trust MEDCARE/SSDI much anymore either- bit if they gave you 4.5 million i think you should leave the broke disabled guy (whos NEVER GONNA PAY THEM ANYTHING MORE ANYWAY) ALONE! FOR REAL- DO YOU WANT MY FIRSTBORN SON? FUCK OFF- TAKE YOUR 80% AND STFU- you drs and shit make OBSCENE amounts of cash- @ some point cant you JUST FUCK OFF AND HELP PEOPLE? Wait let me cut off a pound or two of flesh while I&#39;m @ it you GOP economy and ecosystem and everything can eat a bag of pimple covered dicks. what happened to the hippocratic oath? what happened to altruism?

The most fucked part of it all is that the practices you are going to are suffering this exact thing.

Tried rewashing my clothes at the laundry mat thinking it may have been the detergent. While at the laundry mat my face started turning deep red along with my eyes, it scared the hell out of my wife.

They gave me an injection of benadryl on the way to the hospital.\n\nWhen we got there they gave me a shot of epinphern. Couple hours later I was ok to go home, probably 70% myself. Got the bill from the hospital and it was over $400. The ambulance was over $600. This was with insurance, UPS insurance at that. Starting to think about switching jobs because why do I bust ass for 10 years just to have my body shut down and have bills crammed down my throat. I went into anaphalixs shock a 2nd time and had to use an epipen my primary prescribed me and call an ambulance I refused to let them take me to the hospital a 2nd time because of the bills instead I had them take my vitals and told them I wold have someone take me there if I got worse. Still fighting with my insurance because everything was suppose to be 100% covered \"upon review\" aka if they don't think it's an emergency then you have to pay.",

Please realize that this is not me defending this crazy system, just trying to explain the issue, because the way Reddit presents it makes it very hard to understand how anyone but an idiot or a psycho could tolerate our system.  \n\nFor huge swaths of the middle class, everyone from postal workers to teachers to soldiers to employees at big banks and tech companies and telecoms and utilities, teamsters and unionized factory workers, health insurance is provided by our employers. They pay an annual cost for each worker that the worker never sees and this benefit is a major workplace perk. While you still pay bills, you often have what's called an \"out of pocket maximum co-payment,\" the most a family can ever be asked to pay while insured in a single 365 day period. Despite what you hear on Reddit, this system can sometimes be cheaper (for the middle class workers) than a single payer system, unless you assume your employer would just fork over the total cost of your benefits if they weren't responsible for them, which, at least in American capitalism, is a dubious assumption. \n\nSo, say last four years everything was pretty normal; you had your physicals and some antidepressants (because you're American). This year, your wife gives birth and you have an OOP maximum of $6,000. All her OB visits and everything at the hospital will go towards that, so this year, despite your pre-adjustment costs being $30,000-50,000, you'll only pay $6000. Last four years, with your copays and prescription benefits, you only paid $1000. So, total, you  spent $10,000 in five years, or $2000 average per year, which is vastly less than any family making $70,000-150,000USD equivalent would pay in taxes in a country with single payer. \n\nNow, in those same five years, they've been on hold with insurance for 35 hours, and been misbilled four times, but that's just seen as an unavoidable pain in the ass. Also, during those same five years, poorer and unskilled people got screwed, went bankrupt, and died for lack of care. But people in these groups don't vote in any sort of sizable numbers, and as much as the middle class might want to help them, fear of losing their own family's healthcare in an upheaval and tolerable conditions in the current paradigm keeps many focused on other issues. Our mainstream \"progressive\" party isn't even discussing a universal plan as an option, and Obamacare was not only sabotaged by Republicans, but undermined from within by ghouls like Cory Booker.",

Not that you\u2019re asking for my input, but I\u2019ll leave it here just in case it might help a little :) \n\nFirst, I\u2019d pull your SBC (Summary of Benefits and Coverage). This is that thing you get from your company when signing up for insurance that has your deductible information and other coverage info, such as you\u2019ll pay $500 for an ER visit in network and $1,000 for out of network. I\u2019ve had situations where a place tries to bill me for more than what my SBC says, so I\u2019ll call my insurance and tell them, then they actually deal with the service place and get it all straightened out for me. I just worry about paying what my SBC says and the insurance company deals with the rest. \n\nIf the SBC has $1,500 for an MRI, then yeah, you\u2019re SOL in terms of getting it any cheaper using insurance. If this is the case, I\u2019d call a couple of other places and ask them what their prices are. Be sure to ask if they offer a cash discount. A lot of places will give you an upfront discount (I believe my company typically does 30%) if you pay at the time of service - doesn\u2019t have to be cash, could be a credit card. Plus, when calling around, you\u2019ll probably be able to find a place that does offer a payment plan if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. Definitely try some of the bigger places that are associated with hospitals or large medical groups, they tend to have more payment options available since they serve such a huge patient base. Keep in mind you can have your doctor refer you to wherever (assuming the place requires a doctor referral for a scan), so it\u2019s not like you have to go to the initial place he referred you.",
