All shots were fired within half a second. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Phoenix Police Department&#39;s Use of Force Review Board found Cooke&#39;s shooting to be designated as within policy, but the board recommended the department review policies and training on first aid and the duty to render aid. Neither officer tried to stop the bleeding after Whitaker was shot. Instead, they waited for EMS to arrive.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Police Chief Jeri Williams disagreed with the report and fired Officer Cooke August 2021.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cooke appealed to the Phoenix&#39;s Civil Service Board. That board reinstated Cooke\u00a0in December, but he did serve a 240-hour suspension.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Maricopa County Attorney&#39;s Office did a\u00a0criminal review of the shooting and determined the officer&#39;s actions were justified.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, everything continues to be awful.</p>\n</div>",

The &quot;Ambush&quot; That some are claiming is a trained defensive maneuver in order to not get shot through the door. It&#39;s extremely common training after several cops were killed when suspects fired through the door, killing cops and innocent people alike. They responded to a supposed domestic disturbance call, and these have a tendency to turn violent extremely easily as tensions are very high before the police even arrive.</p>\n\n<p>He instantly went to the ground in a surrender stance and was placing the weapon on the ground. Fuck the cop that shot and killed him. He committed no crime, he did everything properly, even though he had a weapon he instantly did the right thing by going to his knees and attempting to drop the weapon. The cop who fired should be charged with murder and jailed for this.</p>\n\n<p>I watched the bodycam thinking there was no way it was as redditors were claiming, but nope. it was as bad as they claimed. Fucking hell.</p>\n</div>",

Be postured as if they are certain whatever comes out of the door is a murderer and cannot be reasoned with - fingers on trigger, lights in homeowner&#39;s...I mean murderer&#39;s...face\n3.  Be startled by whatever opens the door anyway and never suspect a homeowner might assume a threat from an unexpected knock on the door at night\n4. Have no plan for dealing with anything anyway, shoot to kill, ruin lives, even their own maybe</p>\n\n<p>Should he have opened up so fast while holding a gun? Probably not. Maybe he could have yelled asking if it was his friend or some poorly trained D- reckless cop. </p>\n\n<p>It seems obvious that Ryan Whittaker&#39;s behavior was completely rational and should have been anticipated by the cops. Even if there&#39;s a 3% chance that he&#39;d be alive if he stumbled differently, his behavior in the situation should have been 100% expected by the cops. </p>\n\n<p>Someone much smarter than those cops please tell me what they should have done?  Did they ignore common training?</p>\n\n<p>And fuck CNN etc for basically ignoring this. They go beyond ignorance. Cover all of the news or stop pretending you do.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan&#39;s getting the Daniel Shaver treatment.</p>\n</div>",

DA says &quot;you have to let him go... he could sue the department for false imprisonment.&quot; Apparently the DA was screaming at the cops basically calling them dumb fucks for doing what they did. No warrant, arresting someone other than who they were looking for, etc. By the way, they were looking for his roommate for a bunch of unpaid parking tickets. So yeah.... all of that kicking a door in, slamming my friend to the ground. All over unpaid parking tickets. And they weren&#39;t even his unpaid parking tickets. Oooof. </p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s exactly what my friend did. He sued our local police department (just a small town in USA) Took about 3 years total, police department ended up settling out of court to the tune of $17,000. They settled because they didn&#39;t want it going public and tarnishing the image of their small town police department.</p>\n</div>",

But the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/opinions/systemic-racism-police-evidence-criminal-justice-system/\">weight of academic evidence</a> supports the idea that black people face pretty significant racial bias at the hands of the American justice system. Due to this, the unjust deaths of black Americans receive headlines as they are representative of a widespread societal issue. White people just aren&#39;t as persecuted in American society as a whole, so while this story does contribute to the conversation about police brutality, it is less relevant to the conversation about racial justice. Thus it gets less headlines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do I say all lives matter without saying all lives matter and being lumped in with a bunch of racists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stop wanting to say things the racists say and you&#39;ll avoid having to curb your language to avoid being lumped in with them.</p>\n\n<p>It really isn&#39;t hard to understand.</p>\n</div>",
