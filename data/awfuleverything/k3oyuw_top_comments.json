In terms of Republican morons that's called a \"communist\" health care system. I don't care a SHIT. Crap people spout crap. We just call it our *social* health care system.\n\nWhat does that mean, compared to the mess and cesspool of American health care? Well:\n\n1. EVERYONE has a health insurance that covers all essential medical procedures fully. This means there are virtually no people here who lack a health care insurance. In the USA, the number of uninsured people dropped from ~46 million in 2010 to 26.7 million in 2016 due to the Obama administration policy. Thereafter it is increasing again and now it's almost 30 million and rising. And apart from those almost 30 million people having no health insurance at all, there's a multitude of people suffering a health care insurance with insufficiently poor coverage.\n\n2. In my country the premium for average health care insurance costs about \u20ac 150-175 per month. This is an *obligatory* (Republicans: \"communist\") health care insurance. If you wish, you may choose for a supplementary coverage of less essential medical treatment, which is voluntary. When opted, this will cost an additional \u20ac 15-40 per month. In dollars this equals $ 179-209 resp. $ 18-48 per month. In the USA an average health insurance premium costs about ~$ 495 per mont. Spot the difference? Moreover, from 2010 to 2020, total premiums for family coverage increased by 55%, and the worker\u2019s share increased by 40%, outpacing wage growth. \n\n3. In all international rankings about the quality and equity of the health care system, the USA scores far below average. For instance, in the WHO ranking, the USA occupies the 37th position. Or maybe the Commonwealth healthcare performance ranking? 11th and last position. Any other rating system? Find out yourself - it'll be the same story.\n\n4. What is the overall performance of the US health care system, measured by life expectancy? Well the average life expectancy in the USA at birth is almost 3 years lower than most EU countries. The life expectancy in the EU is on a steady, longitudinal rise, in the USA last years it has been *dropping*.\n\n5. What about the costs of te health care system? By all means, whatever way calculated - per capita or % relative to the GDP, the American health care system is by far the most expensive system in the world. In most EU or other developed countries in the world like Japan, Taiwan, South Corea, Australia, New Zealland, the health care per capita costs are mostly no more than $ 5,000 per year. Only a few countries spend somewhat more: in Switzerland it's $ 5,030, in Norway $ 5,399 and in Luxembourg $ 5.506. The USA? A staggering $ 8.047. Health care in the USA is on average *twice* more expensive than most developed countries. T W I C E.\n\nSo you have a ridiculously expensive health care which performs poorly and leaves a host of people either fully uninsured or insufficiently insured.\n\nHealth care elsewhere in the developed world is, often vastly, *superior* over the American system. In *all* respects.\n\nThe roadblock between a NORMAL (Republicans: \"communist\") and the *inferior* health care system of the USA is called \"Republicans\".\n\nDoes it hurt your butt? *You bet*.\n\nEDIT: some typos and the like.",

Disney World, where she worked her way up to a corporate manager for almost 20 years, fired her even though she only used saved vacation time to get her many surgeries and chemotherapy. Firing someone for getting sick is actually illegal, but Disney does it all the time because it\u2019s allowed as long as it is a \u201cmass\u201d layoff and Disney always has large enough groups to fire at once that they don\u2019t ever have to be accountable. \n\nShe lost her insurance (which still had a lot of out of pocket expenses) when she was fired and started down a long rabbit hole of Cobra and other programs. \n\nShe got taken in by lots of snake oil salesmen as well selling \u201cnatural\u201d cures that she thankfully only did alongside REAL treatment. But was pushed toward because her real treatment was always up in the air due to the loss of her real insurance. \n\nThey lost their savings, they lost their $250,000 house. My father in law moved into a rented mobile home for $500 a month. My wife\u2019s grandparents paid for my mother-in-law to get an apartment in Houston by the cancer hospital as they blew through $100,000 of their retirement. \n\nMy wife and I had to move (from FL) into the 1 bedroom apartment in Houston and sleep on an air mattress to take care of her. We still had all of our bills back home and blew through around $20,000 of our savings. I had just started making $80,000 a year as a freelance food photographer but lost a lot of my clients after being away from my home studio so long. \n\nMother-in-law went on hospice but somehow got a lot better. She was able to go off hospice to go back on treatment but no programs existed to pay at that point. When you go on hospice you MUST die. So once she left the bills racked up faster than ever. She died with at least $250,000 of debt passed to my father in law. \n\nHe drank himself to death within 2 years. The day he died we found a note next to his ATM card. (He knew he was dying for some time). He had saved $4,000 of his social security in the last 2 years to leave to us. He needed us to pull it out before hospitals would claim it. We ended up forging his signature on a check instead because the ATM would take days with the daily limit and have footage of us using it... even though we had his note... the money was technically the debtors\u2019 money. \n\nThat money mostly covered his cremation and cleaning out the rented mobile home. Oh... and in the desk where he\u2019d left the note, we found his gun. He had tried to fire it. It was jammed. \n\nMy wife\u2019s family went from having a net worth of around $500,000 to my wife inheriting $1,000 that we had to steal like criminals. BINDING INSURANCE TO YOUR JOB is the most asinine concept in the world. What job is going to keep you around as you are dying, or if you become a quadriplegic etc?!\n\nThere is a somewhat silver lining to this story...\n\n8 years later... we got a letter in the mail... There was a pension account at Disney my mother-in-law couldn\u2019t cash out. They were looking for my wife to give her $100,000. Changed our lives and was honestly one of the only ways, being freelancers, we made it through this year. \n\nDon\u2019t take that as me forgiving Disney in any way... Disney, like most companies these days stopped offering that kind of pension years ago.",

From the prognosis was never had a chance of living it was basically for a gamble for an extra few months of life, since she wanted to see her new granddaughter this year. Basically what what ended up happening was they were monitoring a growth on her liver when it hemorrhaged and needed to be operated on except when they opened her up the tumor growth was a much more rampant than they anticipated so they only removed some of the tumors and closed her back up and she didn't qualify for a transplant because it was genetic induced instead of caused by something like drinking. We speculate that it could have been caused due to her infusions for her crones and colitis since that knocks down your immune system and she had to have that done each month. Since your immune system helps kill off tumor growth, however that's only speculation. she did experience some radiation sickness initially especially after they put these radioactive glass beads into her liver essentially. Fortunately she never balded (she was losing her hair but she had a lot of it) it was mainly just solely declining and weakening large in part due to lack of appetite and eating as well as constant nausea and vomiting. But I helped her out as much as I could and we installed a chairlift for her as well as helped her get out of bed and go to the bathroom etc. Took a wheelchair to the parks a few times when she was up to it to get her out of the house a bit and distract her from everything, But we also have to be really careful because of covid obviously. Later she got scared from worsening and I was talked into trying tecentriq which had some really scary side effects such as blindness and kidney failure. Which is why she had adversion to it initially. But when your options are take a bullet now or take a bullet later there are no good choices, so I told her I would support her no matter what she decided. The treatment turned her entirely jaundice since it was attacking her liver and the few remaining good parts. But she's declined rapidly after that (due to kidney failure) I was able to talk my sister into a trip down to see us with the baby even though she had hold outs because she's scared of getting sick from covid, but I eventually talked her into it and she passed on the fourth day of her visit so at least I help my mom at least see her granddaughter. There is always suffering when someone is declining like that it was just all consuming due to covid. The only thing that really I think could have made any difference would have been if they allowed her to get a new liver which I offered half of mine (since livers regenerate) but they refuse to do any more treatment outside of chemotherapy partial because they didn't know what was causing the cancer. Since most liver cancer is related to drinking and cirrhosis caused from that. It shows you the limits of medicine when you deviate from the norm since a lot of the procedures for surgeries and treatments are basically step by step instructions that are followed to a T and there is no creative medicine like you see on the TV shows with house.",

The most amazing part, to me, is the fact they&#39;ve successfully brainwashed so many people into thinking this is a fair and balanced system, and that socialised healthcare would be <em>worse</em>... </p>\n\n<p>Most other countries this situation would be addressed by mass-protests, rioting and then a complete collapse of various systems until the government have no choice but to create legislation stopping hospitals and insurance companies from fleecing regular people. American &#39;freedom&#39; seems to block any kind of meaningful change quite well considering I never see mass protests by the people asking for a major overhaul of healthcare.</p>\n</div>",
