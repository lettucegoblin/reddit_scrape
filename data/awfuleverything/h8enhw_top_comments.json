The most infuriating part about his story is that the cop that shot him should never have been a Cleveland cop in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Independence police department found him &quot;emotionally unfit to serve&quot; after only being on the force for 6 months. Instead of firing him, they allowed him to resign.</p>\n\n<p>Cleveland hired him with out checking his application. He had been a Cleveland cop for less than 8 months when he killed Tamir. Cleveland fired him for lying on his application, but not for shooting Tamir. </p>\n\n<p>Being found unfit to be an officer, being involved in a shooting that sparked nationwide outrage, and being fired for lying after only working as a cop for less than 14 months was still not enough to prevent him from being a cop because another Ohio police department hired him after the shooting.</p>\n\n<p>The community was obviously outraged and protested until he stepped out and now nobody knows what hes doing but at least hes not a fucking Ohio cop.</p>\n</div>",

Why even say that?\n\n>you can miss and hit something else\n\nThat's the same for all shooting. Police are supposed to be aware of what's behind the target, even when they're aiming center mass, because shit happens. It's not like aiming center mass absolves police from noticing there's a civilian 20 feet behind the guy they're shooting at.\n\n>in the event there is a real threat you want to stop the threat asap, someone with a gun can still fight after being shot in the leg because adrenaline is a hell of a thing\n\nWhy aren't you out here protesting to have more police arrested for negligence then? Because what *we're* all talking about is police shooting people who aren't a half-second from being shot. We're talking about perpetrators armed with knives and shit, tens of feet from the police, which is plenty of time and distance to put someone down long before it's so imminent that it becomes a need for ASAP killing the threat.\n\nLet's take your argument to its logical conclusion though: Clearly the police should be armed with hand grenades so that they don't even need to be in a threat's line of sight to put down the threat.\n\n>You have other options to disable, gun should be the last resort.\n\nSure, but that doesn't mean the last resort should be used as lethally as possible. Ever see that video of a dude wielding a handgun in a lawn chair having his gun shot out of his hand by a sniper? Following your logic, that was a bad thing for the sniper to do, but it clearly worked out better, so ***I*** would say he made the right decision to aim for the gun/hand instead of the perp's chest.\n\nThe real reason this happens, I'm pretty sure, is because a maimed suspect is a lot more costly to deal with in every regard, from short term (aftermath of the scene) to the long term (court proceedings) to the very long term (prison and health treatment). I mean that, and police being conditioned to react poorly.",

It&#39;s not like aiming center mass absolves police from noticing there&#39;s a civilian 20 feet behind the guy they&#39;re shooting at.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>in the event there is a real threat you want to stop the threat asap, someone with a gun can still fight after being shot in the leg because adrenaline is a hell of a thing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why aren&#39;t you out here protesting to have more police arrested for negligence then? Because what <em>we&#39;re</em> all talking about is police shooting people who aren&#39;t a half-second from being shot. We&#39;re talking about perpetrators armed with knives and shit, tens of feet from the police, which is plenty of time and distance to put someone down long before it&#39;s so imminent that it becomes a need for ASAP killing the threat.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take your argument to its logical conclusion though: Clearly the police should be armed with hand grenades so that they don&#39;t even need to be in a threat&#39;s line of sight to put down the threat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have other options to disable, gun should be the last resort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but that doesn&#39;t mean the last resort should be used as lethally as possible. Ever see that video of a dude wielding a handgun in a lawn chair having his gun shot out of his hand by a sniper? Following your logic, that was a bad thing for the sniper to do, but it clearly worked out better, so <strong><em>I</em></strong> would say he made the right decision to aim for the gun/hand instead of the perp&#39;s chest.</p>\n\n<p>The real reason this happens, I&#39;m pretty sure, is because a maimed suspect is a lot more costly to deal with in every regard, from short term (aftermath of the scene) to the long term (court proceedings) to the very long term (prison and health treatment). I mean that, and police being conditioned to react poorly.</p>\n</div>",
