Instead of hauling his ass in like they should have they turned him over to us and it was pretty much swept under the rug. He kept partying and drinking before getting orders someplace else where he eventually got discharged after being involved in a DUI accident off base.\n\nHad another guy get busted for DUI off base and lost his license but they let him continue to drive on base to work because he needed a way to get to work. He was busted for DUI again off base and discharged after totaling his car when he swerved into a semi on the interstate.\n\nMajor fire broke out in an abandoned section of base housing requiring the response from off base agencies. Asbestos throughout the old housing area to the point where we could train in the buildings at all and actually had to go get exposure reports done because some of us had been training in there. Everyone out there for that fire and the literal days it took to get everything under control. Not a word was said to the off base agencies about the exposures. \n\nHad one guy stealing from the station's fund to do things like shift dinners, holiday meals, that sort of stuff, so he could buy his kids scooters and shit. When he got busted hauling off the recyclables and taking money from the fund they dealt with it behind closed doors, the money wasn't returned, and nothing was ever said about it. He kept running the fund though. \n\nWhen I was in Iraq my friend shot himself and a bunch of the people I work with used his funeral as a chance to go party and fuck off for a weekend without ever attending his funeral. Afterwards people acted like they cared and were there but everyone knew that out of the 25 people who were sent like 5 actually showed up. \n\nThis is just every day shit. Hell I remember the guy who went in to have his gall bladder removed, they fucked up hitting an artery or something, let him bleed out for too long, had to medically induce a coma, he lost so much blood his legs had to be amputated, and while he was still in a coma they tried to discharge him until his family found out, had them wake him up, and then sued the shit out of the military (Air Force I believe, one of their training hospitals) because the guy himself couldn't sue because he was military property at the time of the procedure. Family thankfully won but just imagine going in for a basic surgery and waking up with no damn legs and your family involved in a legal battle with the military because you can't.\n\nEdit: Oh I forgot the time the department also got a guy killed during an air show when a plane wrecked upside down after flying in too low. Due to improper setup and blowing response times the guy burned to death in the plane and the people working the tower got to listen to the whole thing. Afterwards the department tried to pretend like it hadn't done anything wrong and all procedures were followed but once it got out of military hands the truth started coming out about having no one stationed at the outlying stations and that they had to drive all the way around the huge fucking crowd to get to the incident. \n\nIn the videos from the crowd you see the flightline supervisor show up and a fire command vehicle and then it's like four or five minutes until an actual fire department truck gets on scene and even longer to put the wet stuff on the red stuff. The whole time the plane goes from just sitting there to lightly smoking to heavily smoking and then flames. \n\nThen there was the botched response when a woman woke up to find her husband unconscious on the bathroom floor. Called 911, call went out, first run crew went up a road that was under construction (they should have known this and avoided the area) and had to back down the road because there was nowhere to turn around delaying their response and failing to communicate this to dispatch so another unit could be sent out. Rescue started to roll, heard first run was closer, and pulled back into the station thinking they wouldn't need help.\n\nWoman sat there with an LE unit doing chest compressions for nearly 10 minutes because the hospital couldn't get on the line to hear the call and weren't picking up afterwards to send an ambulance. \n\nOnly reason the shit didn't hit the fan is because the guy had a brain aneurysm and was long gone before his wife woke up and found him. \n\nI'm sure more will come back to me in time.",
