There is a Generic Novolog but they don\u2019t list it directly in the system as a generic version so you have to ask your doctor to write a prescription for Insulin Aspart which is significantly cheaper but the exact same product from the exact same manufacturer. </p>\n\n<p>Also Walmart has a generic insulin that is extremely reasonable called Novlin-N, $25 per vial.

I remember I got into a tussle in Yoyogi Park and lost my two front teeth. Got them bonded back together for 1000 yen (around $10 bucks) with insurance, and they've held up for about 2 years so far. An x-ray, MRI and pain medicine for broken ribs after a match came out to about $100 out of pocket, open-and-shut. I caught an _awful_ case of strep throat last year that required 6 days of hospitalization, along with around-the-clock IV-drips and three meals a day (all porridge because I couldn't swallow or speak a single word for about 5 days). The hospital room for an entire week along with all of the treatment came to about $600, and they told me I could even set up a payment plan if that was too much. I was floored. $600 is how much my great-grandmother had to pay for an ambulance to the hospital that was a _three minute ride away_ in Indiana.\n\nI've told my mom to just pay the $1300 plane ticket to Japan and get treatment here if something serious happens back in the States. \n\nEdit: I just remembered my Irish coworker who says he loves the United States, but could never live there because his skin condition requires a certain type of medicine that would bankrupt him in the US.\n\nA lot of Japanese people think we Americans act 'cool' when we say we don't want to go to the hospital. People here will cough twice and say 'I'm gonna go to the doctor, brb', and expect us to do the same when we feel something is out of place. It took me about 5 years of living here before I finally tore down the barrier between me and hospital visits, and I regret not going more often sooner.",

The hospital room for an entire week along with all of the treatment came to about $600, and they told me I could even set up a payment plan if that was too much. I was floored. $600 is how much my great-grandmother had to pay for an ambulance to the hospital that was a <em>three minute ride away</em> in Indiana.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve told my mom to just pay the $1300 plane ticket to Japan and get treatment here if something serious happens back in the States. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I just remembered my Irish coworker who says he loves the United States, but could never live there because his skin condition requires a certain type of medicine that would bankrupt him in the US.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of Japanese people think we Americans act &#39;cool&#39; when we say we don&#39;t want to go to the hospital. People here will cough twice and say &#39;I&#39;m gonna go to the doctor, brb&#39;, and expect us to do the same when we feel something is out of place. It took me about 5 years of living here before I finally tore down the barrier between me and hospital visits, and I regret not going more often sooner.</p>\n</div>",

I'm not saying it's outside the realm of possibility,  there just has to be more to this story than what is being represented here. Never in my 5 years of Underwriting partially self funded SMB insurance policies have I seen an employer sponsored plan with a rate in the $400's and a deductible in the $7000's for a single Male.  Typically when the deductible/coinsurance/ OOP Max is that high, its because the plan is \"catastrophic coverage \" and when that's the case,  the employee premiums should only be like $50 to $100 a month, TOPS. From what I've seen,  these plans almost ALWAYS include Rx coverage (BY LAW per the ACA) and if it doesn't, the employer needs to offer a plan that does include some degree of Rx coverage. \n\nNow the only case I can see this exact scenario happening is if the brand of insulin he needs is considered \"specialty Rx\" and the plan doesn't cover speciality Rx because, like I said above,  it's a catastrophic plan. Even if that is the case,  he should be able to find a Dr. In network that will prescribe an alternative insulin that is covered under the Rx section of his plan. Dr's will often do this because, uh ya know,  they like keeping their patients alive. It goes without saying, insulin is deemed \"medically necessary \" by insurance companies and is always covered to some degree.\n\nFully Insured and Level Funded policies use the same type of plan docs as the partially self funded industry that I  mentioned above, so in the event this restaurant uses an alternative method of procuring their employees health insurance, he should have been covered all the same. Now I realize that in my 5 years in the insurance industry I still see new shit every day that shocks and suprises me, but it's in my opinion that this guy should have had no problem finding insulin with a copay of $40-$75 while on an employer sponsored plan. If he truly wasn't able to, someone needs to investigate either his employer and or the policy holder for some level of insurance fraud.\n\nEdit: After reading through the comments and doing some quick research I just realized that DM1 patients often need multiple injections of insulin per month. If he truly is on a really shitty plan with high Rx copays or he pays a coinsurance % like 50% of the cost of the drug (which is rare, but I've seen them on catastrophic plans I mentioned above), then yeah he would be in trouble.  If that's what happened here then this isn't an insurance issue,  it's a drug cost issue, and believe me America has a HUGE problem with rising drug costs. There's a medication that I saw last week which is used to treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy, it's an orphan drug so there are no generics or alternatives - $2 MILLION PER INJECTION WITH 4 - 5 INJECTIONS A YEAR!

Its the exact same insulin most people in other countries who are talking about how cheap their insulin is are taking. Its easier to overdose on and get into a dangerous low-sugar situation, it doesn't really work in pumps, you need to constantly be adjusting your dosages based on your current sugar readings. It's not an excuse to not change the pathetic healthcare system in the U.S.\n\nBut it can save your life. If you are on newer, expensive insulins always have a talk with your doctor and get the equivalent novalin dosages you need -- just in case. If you're suddenly without insurance, talk to a nurse practitioner for equivalent dosages if you can't get into see a doctor or can't afford one.\nAgain, this isn't an excuse for American Healthcare, but this is something every diabetic needs to be aware of.",

        "body": "Gonna copy a comment I have made previously, because I see this Walmart insulin point brought up whenever insulin affordability is talked about. The insulin Walmart sells (synthetic human insulin) is pretty dangerous for type one diabetics. It peaks MUCH slower then the analog insulin commonly prescribed today. What that means is that to use it without risking a episode of hypoglycemia(low blood sugar) you would need to have several very carefully measured meals throughout the day.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Gonna copy a comment I have made previously, because I see this Walmart insulin point brought up whenever insulin affordability is talked about. The insulin Walmart sells (synthetic human insulin) is pretty dangerous for type one diabetics. It peaks MUCH slower then the analog insulin commonly prescribed today. What that means is that to use it without risking a episode of hypoglycemia(low blood sugar) you would need to have several very carefully measured meals throughout the day.

And sure we pay a lot of taxes, but from what I can gather the mean tax an American pays is around 25%, and the mean tax a Norwegian guy pays is around 35%, both of these are excluding VAT, so Norwegians will pay a bit more. But overall after taxes, Americans have a bunch of insurances to pay, while Norwegians don't. And after you include those expenses, you're paying 2-3% less than the average Norwegian.\n\nAnd yet, when Norwegians go to the hospital, the co-pay is somewhere between 20 and 100 dollars, this is even when you have surgery. And after 450 dollars, the state takes care of all of it. And if you have travel insurance (around 12 dollars/month) it'll cover around 200-250 of those 450* dollars, after co-pay.\n\n*We've got to different co-pays, one at 240 dollars and one at 210 dollars.

And sure we pay a lot of taxes, but from what I can gather the mean tax an American pays is around 25%, and the mean tax a Norwegian guy pays is around 35%, both of these are excluding VAT, so Norwegians will pay a bit more. But overall after taxes, Americans have a bunch of insurances to pay, while Norwegians don&#39;t. And after you include those expenses, you&#39;re paying 2-3% less than the average Norwegian.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, when Norwegians go to the hospital, the co-pay is somewhere between 20 and 100 dollars, this is even when you have surgery. And after 450 dollars, the state takes care of all of it. And if you have travel insurance (around 12 dollars/month) it&#39;ll cover around 200-250 of those 450* dollars, after co-pay.</p>\n\n<p>*We&#39;ve got to different co-pays, one at 240 dollars and one at 210 dollars. And insurance co-pay is around 100 dollars each.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: numbers are wrong.</p>\n</div>",

Yes we spend an absolute butt ton on healthcare, but that's only covering the people actually receiving care. This thread highlights the real issue that a significant portion of Americans go untreated for a ton of health issues because they can't afford it or have no insurance. \n\nFurther, the US has the absolute worst social safety net. A book I read comparing health systems of Scandinavia vs the US used this example (based on a true analysis of differences): In the US, a college aged boy named Billy applied to go to college, but due to his parents making barely above the poverty level of income, he recieved no financial aid. He couldn't afford to live on campus, so he slept on a friends couch to attend the university. Further, Billy has type 1 diabetes and can't afford insulin regularly. Since Billy is crashing on a friends couch, Billy's friend doesn't want his landlord to know he has a squatting friend so Billy must use the back door to enter the apartment every time. The back door is surrounded by marshy ground that soaks through Billy's poor people shoes. \n\nFast forward a month, Billy has a flair up in his foot caused by his diabetes and wet feet. He goes to the hospital where they need to amputate a toe at the cost of $20,000 to taxpayer money (Billy ain't paying). The doctor tells him to keep his feet dry, eat a healthy diet, and to take his insulin regularly or they'll need to cut off his foot next time. Obviously Billy can do none of those things, so the doc does him a favor and supplies him with a month of insulin and sends him on his way. \n\nFast forward another 3 months and Billy returns to the hospital where they indeed need to remove a foot ($50,000) and he can no longer walk. Billy drops out of college and is now placed on disability for life at a cost to taxpayers of $40K per year. A crappy healthcare AND social system failed Billy. \n\nNow let's look at a quick similar scenario in Sweden. Billy enrolls for a low/no cost university paid for by the government as education is a citizen's right ($20k for 4 years). Since Billy's family is poor, he is given a monthly stipend of $800 per month to cover room and board during his university time ($10k per year). Insulin is covered by Sweden's healthcare system (very low cost). Billy is also issued a pair of orthopedic shoes once a year due to his diabetes ($150). After 4 years, Billy graduates college and starts making $75k per year which means no more social assistance and he also pays over $30k per year in taxes for life. He is successful and lives happily ever after. \n\nSorry that was long, but a *huge* portion of what's missing from UKs expenditures is your social net of other programs you offer to help avoid large medical expenses. Other countries often spend astronomically more than the US helping their citizens stay on their feet while the US let's people flounder. Should that also be added into the GDP comparison? Sweden Billy avoided nearly $1M in lifetime medical/social expenses due to a light early investment by Sweden. In the US we stupidly pay for citizens for life only after we cripple them instead of investing early and helping them become productive. \n\nRant over. Enjoy your healthcare. Ours stinks.",
