Notice that this protest is never brought up, it has practically been scrubbed from media because in my opinion it hit the nerves of the people that are the problem.

Guess what: We're going to take yours. We get up at 5 a.m. & work till 10 p.m. or later. We're used to not getting up to pee when we have a position. We don't take an hour or more for a lunch break. We don't demand a union. We don't retire at 50 with a pension. We eat what we kill, and when the only thing left to eat is on your dinner plates, we'll eat that. For years teachers and other unionized labor have had us fooled. We were too busy working to notice. Do you really think that we are incapable of teaching 3rd graders and doing landscaping? We're going to take your cushy jobs with tenure and 4 months off a year and whine just like you that we are so-o-o-o underpaid for building the youth of America. Say goodbye to your overtime and double time and a half. I'll be hitting grounders to the high school baseball team for $5k extra a summer, thank you very much. So now that we're going to be making $85k a year without upside, Joe Mainstreet is going to have his revenge, right? Wrong! Guess what: we're going to stop buying the new 80k car, we aren't going to leave the 35 percent tip at our business dinners anymore. No more free rides on our backs. We're going to landscape our own back yards, wash our cars with a garden hose in our driveways. Our money was your money. You spent it. When our money dries up, so does yours. The difference is, you lived off of it, we rejoiced in it.\u2026We aren't dinosaurs. We are smarter and more vicious than that, and we are going to survive.\"",

Guess what: We&#39;re going to take yours. We get up at 5 a.m. &amp; work till 10 p.m. or later. We&#39;re used to not getting up to pee when we have a position. We don&#39;t take an hour or more for a lunch break. We don&#39;t demand a union. We don&#39;t retire at 50 with a pension. We eat what we kill, and when the only thing left to eat is on your dinner plates, we&#39;ll eat that. For years teachers and other unionized labor have had us fooled. We were too busy working to notice. Do you really think that we are incapable of teaching 3rd graders and doing landscaping? We&#39;re going to take your cushy jobs with tenure and 4 months off a year and whine just like you that we are so-o-o-o underpaid for building the youth of America. Say goodbye to your overtime and double time and a half. I&#39;ll be hitting grounders to the high school baseball team for $5k extra a summer, thank you very much. So now that we&#39;re going to be making $85k a year without upside, Joe Mainstreet is going to have his revenge, right? Wrong! Guess what: we&#39;re going to stop buying the new 80k car, we aren&#39;t going to leave the 35 percent tip at our business dinners anymore. No more free rides on our backs. We&#39;re going to landscape our own back yards, wash our cars with a garden hose in our driveways. Our money was your money. You spent it. When our money dries up, so does yours. The difference is, you lived off of it, we rejoiced in it.\u2026We aren&#39;t dinosaurs. We are smarter and more vicious than that, and we are going to survive.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Hi, Please read if you are having doubts about investing your money in GME today. Some of you will not like what you are about to hear but please stick with it and be open to changing your mind.\n\nTLDR; the information about there being 140% short interest in GME is old information and is most likely not true any more, you may be buying into the hype on misleading information and you are potentially being psychologically manipulated in a very sophisticated way to think that any information that doesn't fit the David vs. Goliath narrative is corporate fake news. \n\nI'm a long time lurker and I am hoping to save even just one person from losing money on GME. What I've seen over the last few days here boggles the mind. Misinformation is spreading like wildfire, the amount of propaganda on here is unreal. People are pulling at your heart strings and getting you emotionally invested as well as financially invested.\n\n**THE NUMBERS**\n\nWhen I first stumbled across the short squeeze on GME concept last week I thought it sounded like a good idea as well and was close to getting carried away by it. The idea that there weren't enough shares for the shorts to buy would cause an infinite squeeze in which the average Joe investor could make a fortune was appealing but ultimately very flawed. People still seem to believe that there aren't enough shares to cover the shorts but if you believe this you have been tricked. Look at the volume of shares that have been traded in recent days.\n\nShares available on the float :  **46.89M** \n\nShares outstanding :  **69.75M** \n\nTrade Volume\n\n Jan 28, 2021   57,010,400 \n\n Jan 27, 2021   93,396,700 \n\n Jan 26, 2021   178,588,000 \n\n Jan 25, 2021   177,874,000 \n\n Jan 22, 2021   196,784,300 \n\n Jan 21, 2021    57,079,800 \n\n Jan 20, 2021   33,471,800 \n\n Jan 19, 2021   74,721,900 \n\n Jan 15, 2021    46,752,200 \n\n Jan 14, 2021   93,717,400 \n\n Jan 13, 2021   144,501,700 \n\nWhy is this important? This is important because it probably shows that the battle has already been fought days ago and you are very, very late to the party. On Jan the 22nd alone 196,784,300 shares were traded!! There are only 69,750,000 in total. That means that all of the shares of GME were bought and sold nearly three times each in one day alone. People that are new to the market are likely to be Naive and not believe that to be possible.\n\nPeople keep going on about how 140% of the shares are shorted. That was true on the 14th of Jan but is almost definitely not true now. Those numbers only get reported every two weeks. As you can see above the shorters have most likely already bought the shares and have lost a lot of money but they are most likely no longer losing money, in fact they might have seen what is going on and might be able to make a bundle of it back. The reports that they had closed positions were most likely true. If you are in this to bankrupt hedge funds that battle was likely won many days ago. The squeeze was squoze.\n\n**THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION**\n\nThere are two very strong psychological drivers at work here and I wonder if a group has intentionally done this or if it has naturally arisen due to the way that popular opinions are upvoted on Reddit.\n\nTHE UNDERDOG. Everybody loves a David vs Goliath story. This narrative that the poors are taking on Wall Street has intoxicated many of you. It is all that you see in these message boards. Unprecedented numbers of messages have completely taken over Reddit and any dissenting voices have been smothered. This underdog taking the big dog down narrative has got people hook line and sinker. And then the idea that institutions are systematically screwing you over really gets to a lot of people. Do corporations sometimes screw over the little guy and write the rules themselves? Yes. Are they doing it this time? It doesn't necessarily follow that the answer is yes. Could Robinhood preventing people from buying shares actually be in the peoples best interest. Yes. Look at how many newbies got in recently and potentially how many will get absolutely burnt because of a lack of basic financial understanding.\n\nGREED. What's better than taking on the big guy and winning? If you had put a bet on yourself winning that would pay off in many multiples. Isn't it ironic that one of the main drivers for people buying into GME was the idea that they might bankrupt people that had got themselves caught in a trap because of greed but in the process themselves beome incredibly rich? The idea that you could stick it to the millionaires AND also become a millionaire? It's like killing greed with greed. Another very intoxicating idea but in trying to destroy what you hate you might become what you hate.\n\nTHE HIVEMIND. I hope some of you can see that if you have been on Reddit for the last few days nearly all that you have seen will be about GME. Nearly all of the comments following the same narrative. People have been upvoting each other when they agree with each other and everything you read just reaffirms what you think any dissent is smothered. Memes have made you happy in the past, you thought they were your friend but they have been turned against you to turn you into a misinformation spreading bot.\n\nVALIDATION The fact that people that you trust have talked about it and backed you might influence the way you think. 'Elon Musk is with me, hell he can't be wrong he's the richest man in the world', 'AOC finally says something I agree with!' You have to ask yourself, 'why is this the one thing I agree with AOC on?' It's because you want the stories of corporate manipulation to be true and for you not to be the one responsible for losing your money.\n\nAnyway, my heart goes out to anyone who gets burnt in this. I wanted to write more and proofread this a bit more but time is of the essence, market opens in an hour and I want at least some of you to read this. Some people will have made a fortune, congratulations u/DeepFuckingValue , but many more will lose and when the dust has settled it'll be interesting to look back and see who manipulated who or whether it all bubbled up quite organically because of Reddit's algorithms feeding people what they want to hear. The story that has been painted is very convincing and plays into the way a lot of people feel at the moment. \n\nAnd here is what might be the controversial bit. This looks to me to be very similar to how the Capitol riots took place. A frenzy being whipped up online and a lot of people feeling very empowered about taking on those in power. Take a look at yourself if you believed in either of these hypes and take another look at who you are believing and why and whether you might be falling for other psychological tricks in the future.\n\nLet the downvotes commence.\n\nThis is not financial advice.",

Here is what happened. \n\nGabe Plotkin's Melvin hedge fund is the counterparty to WSB's scheming short squeeze. They nearly went broke due to shorting 150% of GME's stock which is a fantastically risky thing to do. Plotkin, by the way, is famous for making high risk high reward bets like this. And when they all panned out he was making 30% returns every year. \n\nBut this time some meddling kids turned the tables on his strategy and he was fucked. Guess what Plotkin did to avoid his multi billiion dollar HF from going tits up? He called his buddy and former boss Steven Cohen and said \"hey dude, got a spare $2.8 billion laying around?\"\n\nLuckily Cohen looked under some couch cushions and discovered he did have that and bailed out Gabe's HF, no shit\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest\n\n>A pair of billionaire investors are swooping in to support a short-selling hedge fund in its battle against an army of irreverent day traders.\n\n>Steve Cohen's Point 72, Ken Griffin's Citadel, and other partners are plowing a total of $2.75 billion into Melvin Capital, the hedge funds said on Monday. They will receive non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin in return for their money.\n\nNote the term \"irreverant\", as if regular people making money is somehow wrong but billionaire parasting massive amounts of cash off the backs of the working class is perfeclty okay. \n\nSteven Cohen, by the way, owns the NY Mets and has one of the largest private art collections on planet earth valued at over $1 billion.\n\nHe was also found guilty of one the largest insider trading schemes in wall street hisotory, paid a fine, and walked.\n\n>In 2013, the Cohen-founded S.A.C. Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8 billion in fines ($900 million in forfeiture and $900 million in fines) in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund. Cohen was prohibited from managing outside money for two years as part of the settlement reached in the civil case over his accountability for the scandal. The hedge fund agreed to ***plead guilty to wire fraud and four counts of securities fraud and to close to outside investors***\n\nMeanwhile Martha Stewart was found guilty of a the tiniest fraction of insider trading and actually went to prison. \n\nSo this criminal douche bag bailed out the hedge fund that WSB nearly took down. These rich douches have SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY they can lend $2.8 billion to each other at a drop of the hat and it barely effect their bottom line. Let that sink in.\n\nThere are children in this country whose only solid meal in a day is the shit tier lunch they get at school. And yet Gabe fucking Plotkin can snap his fingers and make $2.8B appear out of nowhere so he can continue to run around shorting stocks and making billions. \n\nTake away: Tax these mother fuckers into the ground!",

He called his buddy and former boss Steven Cohen and said &quot;hey dude, got a spare $2.8 billion laying around?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Luckily Cohen looked under some couch cushions and discovered he did have that and bailed out Gabe&#39;s HF, no shit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A pair of billionaire investors are swooping in to support a short-selling hedge fund in its battle against an army of irreverent day traders.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Cohen&#39;s Point 72, Ken Griffin&#39;s Citadel, and other partners are plowing a total of $2.75 billion into Melvin Capital, the hedge funds said on Monday. They will receive non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin in return for their money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note the term &quot;irreverant&quot;, as if regular people making money is somehow wrong but billionaire parasting massive amounts of cash off the backs of the working class is perfeclty okay. </p>\n\n<p>Steven Cohen, by the way, owns the NY Mets and has one of the largest private art collections on planet earth valued at over $1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>He was also found guilty of one the largest insider trading schemes in wall street hisotory, paid a fine, and walked.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2013, the Cohen-founded S.A.C. Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8 billion in fines ($900 million in forfeiture and $900 million in fines) in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund. Cohen was prohibited from managing outside money for two years as part of the settlement reached in the civil case over his accountability for the scandal. The hedge fund agreed to <strong><em>plead guilty to wire fraud and four counts of securities fraud and to close to outside investors</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Martha Stewart was found guilty of a the tiniest fraction of insider trading and actually went to prison. </p>\n\n<p>So this criminal douche bag bailed out the hedge fund that WSB nearly took down. These rich douches have SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY they can lend $2.8 billion to each other at a drop of the hat and it barely effect their bottom line. Let that sink in.</p>\n\n<p>There are children in this country whose only solid meal in a day is the shit tier lunch they get at school. And yet Gabe fucking Plotkin can snap his fingers and make $2.8B appear out of nowhere so he can continue to run around shorting stocks and making billions. </p>\n\n<p>Take away: Tax these mother fuckers into the ground!</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "> There are companies called hedge funds. They make LOTS of money by basically betting companies will lose money. \n\nMany also bet on stocks going up. Shorts are a classic way of hedging your bullish positions (hence the 'hedge' in hedge fund).\n\n> When they do, their stock options, called 'shorts', are called, and they make a metric fuckton of cash. If a short is NOT called (this is the 'betting' portion), they LOSE the money they invested on the short call.\n\nAlmost none of these words are correct. Short positions don't get \"called\" when a stock goes down. \n\nShorting is borrowing a stock, promising to give it back eventually, and then selling that borrowed stock. The person shorting borrows and sells high, waits for the stock to go down, then buys at a lower price and returns what they borrowed, pocketing the difference. Someone with a short position takes their profit when they choose to do so, just like if you buy a stock you get to decide when you sell it. \n\nThis is NOT stock options, BTW. It's just shares being traded. Though you can use options to bet on stocks going down too (and I'm sure some of these funds did it with GME and are feeling the pain from it).\n\nGetting \"called\" in this context (it's an overloaded term in finance) is, as I understand the story, what happened to Melvin Capital the other day. It's named that because your broker calls you and demands you give them more collateral or else they're going to liquidate your positions because you're so upside down on a trade. Why? Because you borrowed those shares, but the price has gone up so much the person you borrowed them from is worried you won't be able to pay them back. So you have to give them collateral. It works a lot like a collateralized loan- because that's exactly what it is.\n\n> Earlier this week, a reddit thread on r/wallstreetbets was put out there basically challenging the worlds day traders and 'fun money' stock traders (ie, normal folk without a ton of money) to rally around gamestop, purchase shares, and (arguably) artificially inflate the price of Gamestops stock from like, 40 dollars, to over 300. In continuing to purchase more and more of GME (Gamestock), the price kept rising, **which prevented the hedge funds 'shorts' from ever happening, thereby costing hedge funds literally billions of dollars.** \n\nThis is mostly what happened, but the bolded part is wrong. The price of the shares that the hedge funds borrowed skyrocketed. Let's say a year ago they borrowed 2.5 million shares that used to be worth a total of $10 million (random numbers), but two days ago those shares were worth $75 million. The hedge has lost so much money at this point that they have to buy 2.5 million shares and gives them back. But a hedge fund buying that many shares that quickly drives the price up. Now other hedge funds that are short also end up deep underwater on the trade and decide to get out.  The vicious cycle continues and the price skyrockets even more.\n\nBut what happens to those who don't have the cash to buy back the shares they borrowed or provide enough collateral? They go bankrupt. \n\n> This was the 'little peoples' way of saying, fuck you big money, fuck you wallstreet, fuck you hedge funds, we have power too. The meteoric rise of Gamestops stock has broken records and shut down Wallstreet temporarily.\n\nYup, except it didn't shut down Wallstreet. Just some brokers decided to stop allowing people to buy shares of the stocks that were being run up (gamestop, AMC, etc.). \n\n> Eventually the people that made a LOT of money, are going to want to cash in on that money, and sell. Selling will lower the price. \n\nYes.\n\n> Lowering the price triggers a short. \n\nNo, that is not a thing.\n\n> And the shorts will (eventually) make their money...but not after losing so much money they almost went straight up out of business.\n\nSorta. Anyone who shorted at the top - which might have been today - will make a ton of money. Funds who shorted at $30 and survived the ride up will (probably) make their money. But funds who were forced to close the position - like the folks at Melvin Capital - have lost a shit-ton of money and aren't making it back (unless they are also in the first group and had the balls to go short again).\n\nThere are also other dynamics at play here. The whole friday being a key day thing has to do with options contracts. I don't know if Melvin was also betting against the stock this way. I won't go into the details; just know that it's yet another thing that could cause a massive amount of forced buying because someone owes someone else some shares.",
