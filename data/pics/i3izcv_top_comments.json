This is a picture of a SCHOOL, its not a hospital, its not a meat packing plant, teachers and other school employees are the subject of discussion thats relevant to this picture.

Id like to think if I saw this Id walk right the fuck out of the building and tell the district that they can fire me, but theyll be hearing from my lawyers about unsafe working conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Unreal the amount of bullshit comments here saying &quot;teachers are essential workers&quot; or &quot;what about other public employees, why are teachers so special?&quot;.  This is a picture of a SCHOOL, its not a hospital, its not a meat packing plant, teachers and other school employees are the subject of discussion thats relevant to this picture.

It's such a mixed bag as far as what counties decide to do, what they have the resources to do, etc. Some wealthy counties like Columbia County can offer both online school AND alternating days of in-class instruction, where half of the students who want to go TO school come on Mondays and Wednesday, and half come on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and everyone learns from home on Fridays.

But the majority of these systems are also rural, and have large pockets of low-income neighborhoods - including Paulding County. The county seat is Dallas, Ga., with only about 12,000 residents. According to the 2010 Census, the median income for a household in the county was $62,348 and the median income for a family was $67,117. That's more than I make, to be sure. And about 7.0% of families and 8.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.4% of those under age 18 and 11.8% of those age 65 or over. Those are okay numbers.

She's almost 16, she's very responsible, I'm only 10 minutes away from her, and my ex-husband is only 12 minutes away. We also live in a ridiculously safe neighborhood with great neighbors, and yet we're only 150 yards from the town's main strip, if she needs help or supplies. We're a 5-minute walk from a bookstore, an 8-minute walk from a city bus stop.

I was talking to my ex and we agreed that there are no good choices here, only crappy ones. You have to do the best you can and deal with the consequences that arise.   \n\nAll of that to say that it's VERY easy to judge these people, these school systems.

Here is 3rd grade math showing you exactly what will happen and why it doesn't work. If we need X cases a day to hit 70% immunity in a country of 328 million people before active antibodies fade (6 months, generously), and this percent of those cases need to be hospitalized (20%), that translates to this many hospital beds we need every day. Here is the number of beds across hospitals in the USA. Is the number of daily COVID cases that need hospital beds greater than or less than the number of hospital beds in the US? Oh, it's greater? Now here are the normal daily hospital admissions that won't get beds since we're assuming 100% of capacity is devoted to covid. Oh, and the average duration of a COVID19 hospital admission is 10-13 days, which means once those beds are filled, you can assume they are filled for 10 days. Then it's pretty obvious rushing back to normal is impossible without millions upon millions dying.\n\nBut because it blew up her little fantasy, she choose to suddenly claim that math doesn't work? \"I don't believe the numbers.
