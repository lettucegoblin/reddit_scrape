The idea that no one would know her terrified me. </p>\n\n<p>All I wanted to do was tell the whole world about her.  I wanted people to know how funny she was, how kind she was, what her interests were, her struggles, how deeply she loved. I wasn&#39;t around for whatever controversy or anything that a previous post of yours might have caused, but don&#39;t let anyone tell you you aren&#39;t grieving properly. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you to keep it private, to keep your grief to yourself. Don&#39;t listen to the trolls who&#39;ll tell you you&#39;re just doing it for attention. We&#39;ve gone through pain that they think they can imagine but they can&#39;t. Our loss escapes their capacity. </p>\n\n<p>May she rest in peace, I&#39;m sorry for your loss.</p>\n</div>",
