My dad had done some work for this guy on the side and this gentleman had gave us this dirt bike because he had no use for it, we would never be able to afford it otherwise.\n\nWe went camping a few weeks later and when we returned we found the house burglarized, my PS2 stolen as well as my dirt bike. Hastily we made a police report expecting nothing to be done.\n\nA week goes by and by some miracle the police had found my dirt bike! Great! I exclaimed, but its Thursday, we won't be able to pick it up until tomorrow. The officer assured us that it would be fine.\n\nThe next day we arrive at the police lot and I am greater by the sound of my dirt bike being ran in the lot behind. The officer had brought his kids to the lot to ride the dirt bike. A bit annoyed, but ok no harm no foul. Thats when my dad was informed that he would have to charge him 2k dollars for all the \"fees\" associated with the return if the dirt bike. My dad, not having that kind of money, asked for any other options.\n\nThe officer told us that we could wait for police auction to try and get it back or pay the fee. Well the auction wasn't for a month, so my dad desperately tried to scrounge the money up. 1 day later my dad had the money (with additional for the extra day of storage) and he went to get the dirt bike back. The officer we had been speaking to the day before had indicated on the paperwork that we had, \"given up the rights\" to the dirt bike and the officer was allowed to purchase the dirt bike before the auction, my dirt bike had already been sold for a few hundred dollars.\n\nAnd thats the story about how my dirt bike was stolen and then stolen again by police. We never got that dirt bike back and no we didn't sue as it would have been a lengthy expensive hassle.\n\nGoodjob officer dick weed, you stole a 14 year olds dirt bike.",
