        "body": "My \"son's\" therapists and teachers all told me the same thing as he was growing up. \n\nThe reason son is in parentheses is because he is not my son by birth. He's technically not my son, but I refer to him as that whenever I talk about him, and he refers to me as his dad whenever he talks about me to his friends or introduces me to his neighbors. \n\nHe started out as a neighbor's kid. I sold them a puppy, a registered blue heeler, which they decided to return after it was a few months old. He was the prettiest of my dogs 3 litters of puppy's so I decided to keep him instead of re-homing him. Then the mother brought the son by to visit the pup a couple times. The next thing I know I'm getting a call from the kids day care at 8pm saying that I am on the pick up list and no one has showed up to pick him up or is responding to calls and they are closing. So I go to pick him up, feed him, wash his clothes so he has something clean to wear to the next day, and get him back to day-care the next morning. \n\nLong story short, I eventually found out both of this kids parents are severe alcoholics and prescription drug abusers. Kid memorizes my phone number so he calls me whenever he gets in to trouble from his parents disappearing on him and I basically become his primary care giver. All this time I am dealing with child protective services, teachers, and after school care givers, trying to get relatives to step in and do something, I get him in to regular sessions with a really great therapist. This continues for several years. His mom and dad go in and out of prison, dad goes severely off the deep end of alcoholism and eventually dies of liver failure. And I eventually end up with a permanent legal guardianship of the kid with the grandparents blessing. \n\nIt has a good outcome for the kid. He ends up going to the junior olympics in hockey in Jr high. He ends up graduating from high school with honors. He gets accepted to an ivy league university on a scholarship and graduates on time and with honors. He eventually marries a high school sweetheart who becomes a doctor and 2 years out of college he's making more money than she is and than I ever have and and by his mid 20's owns a half million dollar home in one of the fastest growing cities in the country.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My &quot;son&#39;s&quot; therapists and teachers all told me the same thing as he was growing up. </p>\n\n<p>The reason son is in parentheses is because he is not my son by birth. He&#39;s technically not my son, but I refer to him as that whenever I talk about him, and he refers to me as his dad whenever he talks about me to his friends or introduces me to his neighbors. </p>\n\n<p>He started out as a neighbor&#39;s kid. I sold them a puppy, a registered blue heeler, which they decided to return after it was a few months old. He was the prettiest of my dogs 3 litters of puppy&#39;s so I decided to keep him instead of re-homing him. Then the mother brought the son by to visit the pup a couple times. The next thing I know I&#39;m getting a call from the kids day care at 8pm saying that I am on the pick up list and no one has showed up to pick him up or is responding to calls and they are closing. So I go to pick him up, feed him, wash his clothes so he has something clean to wear to the next day, and get him back to day-care the next morning. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short, I eventually found out both of this kids parents are severe alcoholics and prescription drug abusers. Kid memorizes my phone number so he calls me whenever he gets in to trouble from his parents disappearing on him and I basically become his primary care giver. All this time I am dealing with child protective services, teachers, and after school care givers, trying to get relatives to step in and do something, I get him in to regular sessions with a really great therapist. This continues for several years. His mom and dad go in and out of prison, dad goes severely off the deep end of alcoholism and eventually dies of liver failure. And I eventually end up with a permanent legal guardianship of the kid with the grandparents blessing. </p>\n\n<p>It has a good outcome for the kid. He ends up going to the junior olympics in hockey in Jr high. He ends up graduating from high school with honors. He gets accepted to an ivy league university on a scholarship and graduates on time and with honors. He eventually marries a high school sweetheart who becomes a doctor and 2 years out of college he&#39;s making more money than she is and than I ever have and and by his mid 20&#39;s owns a half million dollar home in one of the fastest growing cities in the country.

        "body": "Yep.  I was born in central Illinois in 1981.  If you messed up, you likely got your ass whooped by whose house you were at.  Then they sent you home and called your parents at the same time.  \n\nThen you did the slow walk home full well knowing you were going to to get chewed out and mostly likely whooped again because you couldn't act right in public, but you acted a fool in public, thereby not only making yourself look bad, but also your parents.  \n\nI feel like back then we had a whole lot more freedom as kids.  We could be gone for hours and everyone was fine with it.  But if you messed up the punishments would likely be illegal now in many cases.  But when you really think of it, it kind of makes sense.

We could be gone for hours and everyone was fine with it.  But if you messed up the punishments would likely be illegal now in many cases.  But when you really think of it, it kind of makes sense.

I looked around wondering what the hell it was and I noticed that everyone in the laundromat was frozen in place like statues.\n\nI looked out the large windows and saw that everyone on the sidewalk had also stopped.  Even the cars on the street had come to a complete standstill and the drivers stared straight ahead not moving.\n\nI walked around the laundromat completely puzzled.  I went back to my washer and looked at the lady next to me and I could see that although her body was frozen, her eyes were wide with terror as she stared at me.\n\nThe siren outside was starting to fade.  As it stopped, everybody began moving again right where they left off.  The people were loading and unloading the washers and dryers.  The sidewalk people were moving as well as the cars.  Everything was back to normal except the lady next to me.  She grabbed my shoulders in a panic.\n\n\"You could move during Call!  How did you do that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?  The hell just happened?\"  I asked her.\n\n\"You're from...The Elsewhere!\"  She gasped.\n\n\"What are you talking about?  What is this place?\"\n\nShe started to say something, but stopped herself and just turned on her heel and hurried for the door.  As I watched her go I realized that everyone in the laundromat was staring at me and not in a friendly way.  \n\nAll the people made a fist and began lightly tapping them on their hearts. As they tapped, they made a *hmm* sound with each tap.  The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.  Something was very wrong here.  I forgot my laundry and headed for the door.  None of them followed me or made any outwardly threatening moves.  They just stood there staring at me and tapping their hearts and *hmm*ing.\n\nI left the building and got in my car.  I started the engine and began backing out of the parking space.  A cop car pulled up directly behind me blocking me in.  The cop got out of his car and walked up to my window and made the universal Roll Down The Window gesture.  I looked up at him.  He was wearing a military uniform, but not like any that I had ever seen.  In my business, I see a LOT of military uniforms from every nation, but never had I seen one that resembled this.\n\nThe cop looked down at me with a bemused smile.\n\n\"Well, now.  Don't this just beat all?  Shut off your engine and step out of the vehicle, *please*.\"\n\nI turned off the key and got out.  As I exited, I saw the woman from the Laundromat across the street watching me.  She gave a slight shake of her head as though she knew I was likely to do something dumb and to not bother.\n\nThe cop was staring at me very intently.  There was no smile this time.\n\n\"Not from around here, are ya?\"  He asked.",

I mean sure, you have bills to pay, but if you manage your time and money effectively you can spend plenty of time on your hobbies also. I probably spend at least 20 hours a week playing computer games.</p>\n</div>",
