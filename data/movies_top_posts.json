The use of celebrity voices is not only insulting to the art of voice acting but also takes away from the authenticity of the characters.\nLet me explain. When you watch a cartoon or play a video game, you expect the characters to sound consistent throughout the series or game. However, with celebrity voices, you get inconsistencies because the celebrities may not always be available for recording sessions. This means that the character's voice may change from episode to episode, which is jarring for the audience.\nFurthermore, professional voice actors bring a level of expertise and nuance to their roles that celebrities may not possess. Voice acting requires a specific set of skills, including the ability to modulate one's voice, understand",
