It may not have been articulated to be about that among common, everyday job-types in the Northern states but in Congress and on the political stump, this was the deciding issue. \n\nFurthermore, this issue had so flummoxed the Union that for 40 years, new and more convoluted laws were passed to maintain the institution of slavery despite the fact that the entire time this was happening, generations of Southern plantation owners and aristocracy had a deep-seeded fear that slavery would be abolished.

These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. &quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or you can read the <a href=\"http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/\">Cornerstone Speech</a> by the <em>Vice President of the Confederacy</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. <strong>This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, The South was hunky dory with having the federal government intervene when it meant benefiting slavery and imposing restrictions on the free states with things like like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850\">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford\">Dred Scott decision</a></p>\n\n<p>Boo Confederacy. Booooo.</p>\n</div>",

In order to prevent further damage to the other gravesites, his grave was disinterred, and moved to the back of the cemetery. The spot he was reburied (and remains today) was intended to be a temporary grave, as the cemetery was undergoing a redesign, in preparation for the thousand of other American servicemen who were to be laid there. \n\nThe American Battle Monuments Commission intended to rebury Patton back alongside the other soldiers (generally speaking ABMC followed a policy where soldiers were buried together, regardless of rank). When news reached Patton's wife of his disinterment, and that the ABMC planned to bury him for a third time, she protested against any further moves (paraphrasing her, \"what don't you understand about rest in peace\") and threatened to begin the process of repatriating Patton back to California.\n\nHer protest caught the attention of the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg (a personal friend of Beatrice), who offered her a final resting place in the Grand Ducal of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg. The protest from his wife, the subsequent offer from the Grand Duchess, and the overall bad publicity the ABMC was garnering over a war hero, led to them dropping all further plans for Patton's grave.\n\nHe remains at the back of the cemetery to this day (a myth persists that the grave was designed with him at its front, but as I explained, its positioning wasn't done for that reason...). In fact, the second gravesite that Patton was laid to rest was considered the back of the cemetery at the time (though the layout of the site today, with the memorial and everything, would probably have most people consider it to be the front now... which was probably how the myth started).

The breaking away of the South to form the CSA was the most egregious of these divisions. He would certainly have been stern when needed, but I can imagine much of Lincoln\u2019s Reconstruction would be based around realigning the states as a strong federation and a progressive policy to deal with a large free black polulation living in a land that just had hundreds of thousands of men die in an attempt to preserve their enslavement. Instead, we ended up with a Reconstruction policy defined by retribution, opportunism, and exploitation while ignoring a racial powder keg that manifested itself in horrible ways.

        "body": "Except, it really wasn't an argument made often at the time that the Civil War as over the \"states' right to own slaves.\"  I'd argue that's a southern revisionist argument.  At the time, if you read the South Carolina Declaration of the Causes of Secession (which one can point to as an impetus for the war) South Carolina contends that their secession was due to the election of Lincoln who they viewed as a potential tyrant who would take away their slaves and another key development since 1850:  In 1850, the Compromise of 1850 stipulated (among other stipulations) that California would enter the Union as a free state, but the southern states would get a stronger fugitive slave law.  Northern states, burgeoning with abolitionist sentiment, exercised their \"states' rights\" by electing not to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law within their borders and not cooperating with federal authorities with the apprehension and deportation of runaway slaves to the south.  In many ways, it was the northern states exercising their \"states' right\" to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law that southern states abhorred (ironically since South Carolina itself had so vociferously advocated for the states' right of nullification in 1832.)  South Carolina claimed the federal government was not actually being strong enough in forcing the northern states to comply to protect slavery that was protected by federal law.\n\nMississippi's secession document is far less nuanced:\n\n>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\n\nI think Lincoln said it best in his Second Inaugural address when telling the people then and future generations what the cause of the Civil War was:\n\n>One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Except, it really wasn&#39;t an argument made often at the time that the Civil War as over the &quot;states&#39; right to own slaves.&quot;  I&#39;d argue that&#39;s a southern revisionist argument.  At the time, if you read the South Carolina Declaration of the Causes of Secession (which one can point to as an impetus for the war) South Carolina contends that their secession was due to the election of Lincoln who they viewed as a potential tyrant who would take away their slaves and another key development since 1850:  In 1850, the Compromise of 1850 stipulated (among other stipulations) that California would enter the Union as a free state, but the southern states would get a stronger fugitive slave law.  Northern states, burgeoning with abolitionist sentiment, exercised their &quot;states&#39; rights&quot; by electing not to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law within their borders and not cooperating with federal authorities with the apprehension and deportation of runaway slaves to the south.  In many ways, it was the northern states exercising their &quot;states&#39; right&quot; to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law that southern states abhorred (ironically since South Carolina itself had so vociferously advocated for the states&#39; right of nullification in 1832.)  South Carolina claimed the federal government was not actually being strong enough in forcing the northern states to comply to protect slavery that was protected by federal law.</p>\n\n<p>Mississippi&#39;s secession document is far less nuanced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think Lincoln said it best in his Second Inaugural address when telling the people then and future generations what the cause of the Civil War was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
