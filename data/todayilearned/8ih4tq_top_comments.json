But u/Back_To_The_Oilfield was nice enough to correct me, and I found this great up to date [chart](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/charts/imports_domestic_petro_shares_demand_large.jpg)  that says we only import 19% of our oil from imports. \n\nWooops!\n\nOriginal dumb comment:\n\nI am not an expert, but I was also curious. ~~Yes, we do export oil, but according to [this article from PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/does-the-us-export-domestic-oi), we refine 17.6 million barrels a day, 9% of which we export (1.6 million barrels), but we also import 13 million barrels a day. So we don\u2019t sell more than we buy.~~\n\n~~I wanted to calculate what percent of how much we consume a day is domestic, but the numbers don\u2019t add up. From the PBS article, it would seem that we purchase 29 million barrels a day, but the [US Energy Information Agency\u2019s website](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&t=6) (didn\u2019t know that was a thing) says we only consume ~ 20 million barrels a day. ~~\n\n~~It\u2019s unclear to me where that missing 10 million barrels a day goes, I assume into reserve. If all of that reserve is produce domestically, which again as a non expert, I think might be the case, then about 65% of daily consumption is imported oil. ~~",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>BIG EDIT I SCREWED UP:</p>\n\n<p>Ugh. Okay. So I messed up and based almost everything off of the PBS article I found. I messed up and read the date as 2018. I was lazy. I suck. But <a href=\"/u/Back_To_The_Oilfield\">u/Back_To_The_Oilfield</a> was nice enough to correct me, and I found this great up to date <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/charts/imports_domestic_petro_shares_demand_large.jpg\">chart</a>  that says we only import 19% of our oil from imports. </p>\n\n<p>Wooops!</p>\n\n<p>Original dumb comment:</p>\n\n<p>I am not an expert, but I was also curious. <del>Yes, we do export oil, but according to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/does-the-us-export-domestic-oi\">this article from PBS</a>, we refine 17.6 million barrels a day, 9% of which we export (1.6 million barrels), but we also import 13 million barrels a day. So we don\u2019t sell more than we buy.</del></p>\n\n<p>~~I wanted to calculate what percent of how much we consume a day is domestic, but the numbers don\u2019t add up. From the PBS article, it would seem that we purchase 29 million barrels a day, but the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6\">US Energy Information Agency\u2019s website</a> (didn\u2019t know that was a thing) says we only consume ~ 20 million barrels a day. ~~</p>\n\n<p>~~It\u2019s unclear to me where that missing 10 million barrels a day goes, I assume into reserve. If all of that reserve is produce domestically, which again as a non expert, I think might be the case, then about 65% of daily consumption is imported oil. ~~</p>\n</div>",
