They have EMTs for a reason, they have phone numbers to call if you are having a medical emergency...why didn&#39;t a member of his entourage or simply just a damn friend bring him his prescription from pharmacy?</p>\n\n<p>This story sounds like BS...not even bc she won 5 figures on a scratch off, but because here&#39;s a rapper who has <em>millions and millions of dollars</em>...but absolutely nobody within arms reach that could go pickup his prescription of insulin at the pharmacy for him? He can&#39;t pay a doctor or pharmacy to deliver it to him??</p>\n\n<p>Without insulin, a diabetic has, generally speaking, a very narrow window of time without being administered their insulin before they&#39;ll go into what&#39;s known as a diabetic coma...and yet, somehow he surpassed not 1 or 2...but 3 hours of waiting for this fan to arrive?! C&#39;mon dude, this story makes 0 sense.</p>\n</div>",

Even then my doctor has forgotten to prescribe me needles and adequate amounts of test strips, their office hasn\u2019t responded to faxes of a medical supplier thus delaying me getting a useful CGM that\u2019s COMPLETELY covered by my insurance, and has failed to administer me tests to officially diagnose my kind of diabetes. I pay like 220 a month. I use my lunch break everyday calling medical suppliers, my insurance company, my pharmacy, and my doctors office because all of these entities are seemingly useless unless I get that on the phone and beg them to interact with each other. My point is, even when the system is supposed to be working it\u2019s still terrible. I fear for when I lose my health insurance and I have to make all these phone calls, manage my diabetes, AND pay unprotected prices for insulin.</p>\n</div>",

The scripts are written like \u201clong acting: 20u a day\u201d because long acting for the most part will stay the same and then drs will write short acting like \u201c6 doses of 7u a day\u201d or something like that. I\u2019m not taking those specific doses but it\u2019s written to ensure that I\u2019m getting enough vials so I can use 42u a day if I need to based on the sliding scale I use (that was initially put together with my dr but that I\u2019ve adjusted over time).
