IN the US, it's a program started in the 50's to get dads spending more time with their kids (and really probably a way to monetize the camp sites in the winter). So three campouts a year, the dads got waaaaay into it - food, good cocktails around the fire when the kiddos crashed, horseback riding, canoes, hiking. Those campouts were bigger than christmas for our kids. So with 2 girls and a boy, and one \"graduating\" to the more hardcore camping group, I ended up doing 9 campouts every school year. \n\nSo we put flyers in the school papers, wanted to give every dad a shot at it. I got a call from a mom, \"PLEASE call my husband, he HAS to do this!\" I call the dude, explain what we're doing, love you to join us, your kids will love it.\n\n\"That's ridiculous! You think I can pack in a whole weekend fooling around camping with my kids??\" I basically thought (A) we probably don't want ya anyway, and (B) let's see what kind of nursing home your kids put you in some day.\n\nMy kids are now 27, 28 and 31 - they were all home for christmas and it was awesome, we spent so much time together, they had lists of the meals I needed to cook, invited kids I've known for decades, I finally built a legit stone fire pit and we spent hours at night around the fire. You get that from really loving your kids and making them a priority; you really can't fake it or phone it in. But I still feel like the luckiest bastard on earth.",

We switched to formula as quickly as possible so that I could feed baby half the time.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a shock realizing how this is viewed from older generations. I\u2019ve had conversations with older family members that scoff that I\u2019m the one taking baby to appts or changing diapers or giving her baths, almost bragging that they never did those things. \n\nI suppose if my wife stayed home and didn\u2019t work it would be more fair to have her take the bulk of the work but I can\u2019t believe there are relationships where both parents work yet the mom takes on all the childcare. \n\nI have a baby girl and my goal is to shower her with love and affection, let her be exactly who she wants to be and give her every opportunity to do so.

Gotta play zone so if you\u2019re giving one kid a bath better make it 2. Bed time stories one takes the older 2 other takes the younger 2,etc.... I never minded diapers. I mean how long does it really take? 1-2 minutes max. We did have some things we were both better at or at least minded less. I didn\u2019t mind cleaning so they\u2019d all go to the park and I\u2019d clean the whole house. But I hated the picking up so the wife would help the kids get the toys picked up so daddy could clean.  But that was more preference as anything. She stayed home with the kids until they were all in school but to me that didn\u2019t give me a free pass to be a lazy butt when I got home from work. I knew how hard she worked being a stay at home mom. My oldest is a father now and he\u2019s awesome. My own father probably never changed a diaper but he was the dad that would play with the entire neighborhood.

He had his faults but he always made family his priority and I guess we\u2019ve just passed that down from generation to generation.

But I\u2019ll give you the best advice I can and you can follow up with Q because this timing is one of the most important decisions of your life, for all three of you.\n\nFirst and foremost, when people say \u201cit\u2019s hard but doable\u201d that\u2019s not really describing the flavor of pain and stress that\u2019s about to be dropped on you. I had a healthy child, and if I had to pick between reliving his first three months and taking a penalty kick from cristiano ronaldo to the nuts, I\u2019d take the kick. I\u2019d take ten kicks. And that\u2019s with a healthy one. If the kid has complications and is in the NICU, you won\u2019t want to do any work. And your path forward will be even harder. There are truly a ton of unpredictable factors. \n\nI\u2019ve finished engineering projects without sleeping for 38 hours. I\u2019ve driven across the country and back without sleeping for 42. I say this not as a weird brag but so you have context when I tell you: his first two weeks were so much harder than either of those. I thought diapers would be hard and sleep deprivation would be easy. I was wrong. My child would have cracked the toughest prisoner in Gitmo. I promise you. Running on two hour nights of sleep for weeks on end will really bury you. \n\nNow imagine that you\u2019re going through all of the above but you went to the gym and squatted so much weight you\u2019re recovering from a torn asshole. Welcome to your wife\u2019s world. There\u2019s a reason spartan women dying in childbirth were buried with the soldiers. Whatever you feel, want, need, your wife needs it worse at that time. I promise. So you\u2019re going to have to be more selfless than you\u2019ve ever been. I promise you.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to scare you. The amount of family time that America provides for new parents is frankly barbaric compared to the rest of the developed world, and having a kid in grad school is a wonderful opportunity to spend more time as a family unit. But your work will, or should, slow to a crawl during that time, at least the first 3 months. Note that your experience will also be STRONGLY affected by the support network to have around you. I\u2019m as close to my in-laws as my parents now because when shit hit the fan during the end of my PhD (had to rerun thousands of experiments in a few weeks) they covered for me big time.\n\nThe best success stories I\u2019ve heard about having kids in graduate school are when they come immediately after the first milestone. Because the truth is, now that my son is 9 months he\u2019s manageable and ready for babysitting. I gather you\u2019re in some sort of computer science program. So whatever your LAST milestone before the defense is, quals, comps, prospectus, whatever, aim for the kid to come right AFTER that. Which means you start shooting your shot 9 months before that time.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll knock out the last milestone, slow your work to a crawl, spend 3 months supporting your wife, and slowly transition back into work to ramp up for final projects/experiments and dissertation writing. To be honest, I would divide the phases into the first 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and beyond. You will be unreachable the first two weeks, and you won\u2019t get much done the first 3 months. \n\nMy advice would be to wait a bit. If your wife knows you\u2019re serious, she should be ok with this compromise. You knock a kid out to arrive right after the last milestone, he/she is over a year old during your dissertation defense, and by that time they\u2019re ready for daycare/babysitting/fancy Montessori depending on your job. Rather than be called back to work in a month tops because America hates families, you\u2019ll have the flexibility and freedom to balance things as you wish.",

Just yell constantly at the top of his lungs, nonsense speech...having to take care of him in every way...forever. You basically can have no relief, no life. But that's loving your kid.\n\nI know it's controversial to say something like this, especially these days with acceptance and all, but I really want gene therapy with babies to remove stuff like autism before they're born. It's possible, but still we're not there yet and controversial because there's people with autism that live pretty normal lives and a lot of our most talented people have it. Regardless, in situations like my fathers friend, his kid who will never grow up and basically strangle the life out of his own father...I wish the science was there to fix it in the womb.",
