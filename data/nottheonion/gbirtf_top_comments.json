They raise the gas tax to 'pay for the roads', then cut general fund dollars to infrastructure because, well, they raised the gas taxes.  So, let's go give a tax cut to our businesses instead.  \n\nWe handle government revenue and spending in this country in an absolutely absurd way.  We shouldn't plan our spending on how many dollars we feel like chucking at a problem, but on what we consider to be a satisfactory outcome and then budgeting accordingly.  \n\nWe should implement use taxes only to regulate desired market outcomes.  Tax the shit that we want to discourage, etc.  \n\nThen, raise the rest as necessary income tax.  Why? These are output dollars to the system.  You have use taxes, you are slowing economic activity, putting brakes on the economic engine that multiplies dollars.  Additionally, use taxes are by their nature reverse-graduated; the same use/sales tax is a higher percentage of poorer folks' income.  We want folk to spend their money; we can use income tax graduation to make sure we only take what folk can afford to give in order to pay for the priorities we've identified.  \n\nDon't think this makes sense? Imagine if we ran our military like our school system - budgeting a certain number of dollars per soldier rather than around our ability to achieve a mission.  If that sounds like ludicrously stupid way to run a military, maybe we shouldn't run our schools that way either.  \n\nIt's no secret our public schools underperform.  There's two big reasons for this - we don't have enough teachers, and they aren't paid enough.  It looks like we spend the same amount of dollars as nations with far better public education systems, but that's because other nations don't pay for student lunches, student transport, or staff/faculty health care out of their education budgets.  We spend ~15-25% more on our schooling just from transport and lunches alone; health care brings it in the realm of 45%.  When you adjust for those numbers - to nobody's surprise, it's instantly clear that we spend way less on our students than any other developed nation.  \n\nThis is what happens when we run our nation on propoganda numbers and dollar-figure shell games rather than setting goals and investing what we need to achieve what we've identified as public priorities.",

We&#39;re not geting paid for the 3 months we&#39;re &quot;off&quot; we&#39;re getting paid our due; what little payment it is. Most teachers (myself included) work multiple jobs over the year or take summer jobs on our time &quot;off&quot; to supplement the low pay.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not saying teachers <strong>need</strong> to get paid six figures (but I wouldn&#39;t say no to that paycheck). Teachers should be paid enough to live comfortably without having to take multiple jobs to make ends meet.</p>\n</div>",

Many states dont allow government employees to strike, more allow the government to forcibly end strikes of government employees whenever they deem it necessary; which they always do.\n\nMoreover, depending on state the public may have a negative reaction to the strike. Unions have a poor reputation in many conservative states and it's not uncommon for local politicians to quickly turn the public agaisnt the strikers and their situation ends up even worse as parents and citizens demand the firing or punishment of the strikers.\n\nAlso, even those successful strikes you mentioned achieved very little. A one time single digit percent pay increase does not outweigh the inflation that occurred during the multiple years their pay was *not* raised.\n\nAnd finally, the government here in the US has a history of immediately breaking agreements made with public sector unions, and what can they do but strike again to exactly the same result?\n\nStriking only ever achieved results when it had a credible threat of *something* behind it. Violence or damage to the economy. Something. Modern strikes dont have that. At best they have the power to generate publicity, but that has its limits. There is a whole army of reserve part time teachers just waiting on a full time spot to open up and the school districts know it. If push came to shove the districts would just fire the strikers and have the positions filled again by the end of the week as well as a fine new angle of attack on the union for causing the strife in the first place.\n\nThe unions know they play a dangerous game and so are understandably wary of taking actions.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Striking is quite difficult depending on state and organisation. Many states dont allow government employees to strike, more allow the government to forcibly end strikes of government employees whenever they deem it necessary; which they always do.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, depending on state the public may have a negative reaction to the strike. Unions have a poor reputation in many conservative states and it&#39;s not uncommon for local politicians to quickly turn the public agaisnt the strikers and their situation ends up even worse as parents and citizens demand the firing or punishment of the strikers.</p>\n\n<p>Also, even those successful strikes you mentioned achieved very little. A one time single digit percent pay increase does not outweigh the inflation that occurred during the multiple years their pay was <em>not</em> raised.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, the government here in the US has a history of immediately breaking agreements made with public sector unions, and what can they do but strike again to exactly the same result?</p>\n\n<p>Striking only ever achieved results when it had a credible threat of <em>something</em> behind it. Violence or damage to the economy. Something. Modern strikes dont have that. At best they have the power to generate publicity, but that has its limits. There is a whole army of reserve part time teachers just waiting on a full time spot to open up and the school districts know it. If push came to shove the districts would just fire the strikers and have the positions filled again by the end of the week as well as a fine new angle of attack on the union for causing the strife in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The unions know they play a dangerous game and so are understandably wary of taking actions.</p>\n</div>",
