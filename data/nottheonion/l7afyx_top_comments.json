        "body": "30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\n\nI'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\n\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird",

        "body": "TIFU but not realizing just how naive I am. \n\nI\u2019m not a complete idiot, I realize companies and banks need to make money, and I noticed that Robinhood does not charge for trades. I\u2019m old enough to remember this SNL commercial from when I was a kid (https://youtu.be/KodqIPMbyUg) so I knew it was not just the volume of the free trades that allowed Robinhood to operate and make a profit, but I kinda figured they must make money using the uninvested cash in people\u2019s accounts, or float, (see I must be smart I know banks make money on \u201cfloat\u201d), or by pocketing the rounding errors on fractional trades, or something. The truth is, I never gave it much thought. \n\nI didn\u2019t care because here was a company that was finding a way for small investors like me to trade without having the profits sucked away by fees. I even liked the name; Robinhood, hero of the little guy, giving retail investors like me free access to the same market that the Friar Tucks of the world use to suck billions out of the economy. Fuck yeah. \n\nTIFU and forgot, if I\u2019m not paying, I\u2019m not the customer, I\u2019m the product. I always seem to be the fucking product, even when I do pay. \n\nSo, when I read @gruber\u2019s blog (@daringfireball)  and saw him reference this thread: https://twitter.com/toxic/status/1353890766800621569, I realized Robinhood is selling my trade information to Friar Tuck before they even make my trade, so that if my retail trade is going to affect the price, Tuck can get there first. \n\nTIFU and forgot, maybe I can win, but the house is always going to win more. \n\nThis is not victim blaming. I should have known better than to trust a service that I was not paying for without doing due diligence. \n\nAnyone out there want to start a trading platform that is it\u2019s not selling my information and 100% transparent about how it\u2019s making money?

I\u2019m old enough to remember this SNL commercial from when I was a kid (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KodqIPMbyUg\">https://youtu.be/KodqIPMbyUg</a>) so I knew it was not just the volume of the free trades that allowed Robinhood to operate and make a profit, but I kinda figured they must make money using the uninvested cash in people\u2019s accounts, or float, (see I must be smart I know banks make money on \u201cfloat\u201d), or by pocketing the rounding errors on fractional trades, or something. The truth is, I never gave it much thought. </p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t care because here was a company that was finding a way for small investors like me to trade without having the profits sucked away by fees. I even liked the name; Robinhood, hero of the little guy, giving retail investors like me free access to the same market that the Friar Tucks of the world use to suck billions out of the economy.

So using that as a base metric why don't we go ahead and try and determine the value of one lifetime employee losing the entirety of their pension and count every year they would have had in retirement as a year of life they lost.\n\nThe average retirement year in the U.S. is 64. The average lifespan in the U.S. is 78.54 (rounded to 78.5 for convenience). That means each person who loses their pension has lost an average of 14.5 years of their life.\n\nLets say the minimum age of hedge fund managers is 30 years old (ignoring outliers and the actual average, as this is meant to examine the situation in the light most favorable to them). In that situation, each hedge fund manager has at most 48.5 years of life left for themselves on average. That would account for roughly 3.35 people's lives that were ruined by the sacking of their pensions.\n\nIn my opinion, every hedge fund manager whose cost 3.35 people the remainder of their life in the most difficult period to continue work deserves to have just as much of their lives taken away.",
