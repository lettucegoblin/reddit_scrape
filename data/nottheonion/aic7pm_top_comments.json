        "body": "Edits to clarify/fix in bold\n\nThere are a lot of different rules surrounding contact in the NFL and it only gets more complex as safety becomes more of an emphasis. To be honest, you won\u2019t ever really get it until you watch, but I can kind of break it down a bit.\n\nThe most obvious is that the person with the ball is always free game to tackle (during the play). How you\u2019re allowed to tackle is a whole other can of worms, but the basic rules are you can\u2019t hit the head/neck area of a player just catching the ball (defenseless receiver), no helmet/shoulder to helmet/neck contact ever (unless very slight), and no horse collar tackles ever (pulling a player down from behind by his collar bone or **the inside of** jersey/pads on the shoulder. **Pulling a player down from behind by grabbing the shoulder is allowed but as soon as a finger slips inside his pads/jersey it\u2019s a foul, so those tackles are rare but do happen**).\n\nThe quarterback has special rules around them. They wear less pads than a normal player and are the most important player on the field, probably moreso than any other position of any major team sport. You can never his a QB in the head with any part of your body and you can\u2019t tackle them below the knees.\n\nThose are the most important rules as far as tackling, but you were asking about blocking. If you\u2019ve ever seen a football play, you\u2019ll notice that on either side of the line where they play starts (the line of scrimmage), there is a line of big dudes from each team that slam into each other as soon as the play begins. Those are your offensive and defensive linemen. Blocking (pushing but not grabbing as other have explained) is allowed at all times within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage, which allows for this. You can also stuff a wide receiver at the line by doing this, but you risk missing and having him blow by you, so that is a risk-reward thing the defense has to decide on. Once 5 yards past the line of scrimmage, blocking is illegal until one of two things happen: 1) The QB throws a pass to a player and it is caught. You can\u2019t block until someone touches the ball after it leaves the QB\u2019s hand. So when the receiver touches the ball, he can be tackled or his teammates can start blocking for him to advance, but not before. If a defensive lineman blocks or tips the pass, blocking is allowed even with the ball in the air because someone touched it after the ball left the QB\u2019s hand. **2) When the QB hands the ball off or runs with it himself. Worth noting that the QB loses his special contact rules when he becomes a runner.**\n\nA defender is allowed to keep a hand(s) on a receiver as long as they don\u2019t effect their position. They can\u2019t hold, they can\u2019t push, but they can rest their hands on you or even sometimes wrap their arms around you (to an extent) if they don\u2019t stop your movement. Neither the receiver or defender is allowed to hold or push on the other. When the ball is in the air, the defender has equal rights to go for the ball, so if they bump into each other while both jumping for the ball, it\u2019s not a foul, but if the defender isn\u2019t trying to catch/swat the ball and does anything other than have a hand or two on the receiver, it\u2019s a foul.\n\nSo what\u2019s the big deal about the play everyone\u2019s talking about from yesterday\u2019s game? Not only did the defender hit the receiver before the ball got there (no one had touched it after the QB let go of it, so no contact allowed), but he hit helmet to helmet on a defenseless receiver, so even if he wasn\u2019t early, which he clearly was by the naked eye, the hit itself was blatantly illegal. If either foul was called it was game over. Neither was called and the other team ended up winning.",

For anyone who has never been to an NFL game or just never noticed, basically after every play that *could* result in a commercial (after a field goal/extra point, kickoff, injury, or review), the guy with orange gloves gives signals to the officials to let them know if a commercial is coming up.  Either makes a \u201ccontinue\u201d motion (waving his hand in circle) to signal that play will continue and the network is not taking a commercial break, or he crosses his arms making a letter X across his chest to tell officials the network will take a commercial after the next play. Then he stands there with one arm still across his chest until the network break is over, then he makes the continue motion by waving his hand in a circle again to tell the officials to resume play. Anyways, more often than not, after a play is challenged, they go to commercial. The head referee who makes the announcement after the review, has already determined if the call will stand or be reversed by the time the network comes back from commercial. He stands on the field watching orange glove guy for 1-2 minutes, just waiting for him to circle his hand to indicate they are live, and to make the announcement. Same thing happens before kickoffs/after punts. Players are already on the field, already out of their huddles.. just waiting for orange glove guy. Cut down on this shit and games would move so much more quickly. I was at a Steelers game last year and the ref was ready to make the call for 4 minute before the commercial was over. By that point the entire crowd was booing, not the officials, but NBC (Sunday night). ",
