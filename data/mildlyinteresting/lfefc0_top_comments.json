It literally locks into your computer and then you lock it around a table or something that someone can\u2019t get it off of. That way if you have to leave to go to the bathroom, someone can\u2019t steal your computer without literally breaking it and ruining it because the lock is inside your computer. Do people not know about these? Do they not make them anymore? I feel like it\u2019s a must have if you\u2019re a high school/college student.",

If you're walking home with groceries and they're slipping, it's safer to ask a stranger to grab a bag while you readjust then to accept help from someone who offered to carry them for you.

There was no reason for this, as we had smart card readers and the chip was in our employee IDs that we were supposed to always have with us. </p>\n\n<p>The prank went like this: I see unattended comp, I pop open their email and send myself an email with the word &quot;NOW&quot; in the subject line. My email would then send my coworker an email with the code for the add-in with the subject line &quot;GO!&quot; After I installed the add-in I just had to restart Outlook and left. The add-in gave me the ability to send two commands via email:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Loop&quot; would cause the cursor to start making and increasingly growing spiral.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lock&quot; would immediately lock the computer.</p>\n\n<p>The add-in checked the subject line and silenced notifications for the email, as well as marking it as read and then deleting it, all before executing the command. We had a tight-knit team and it was dumb and fun.</p>\n</div>",
