Every morning and every night when I got home from school I cracked open that anthology and read each and every comic again and again and again. Stan Lee gave me a healthy escape to a world where all loose ends tied up nicely, where the bad guys always lost, where I knew I was safe.\n\nRest in peace Mr. Lee. Thank you for everything you've done for me and the likely tens of  thousands like me. ",

He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I\u2019m not powerless just because I was a kid. \n\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to write off comic books as a child\u2019s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes.

I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the \u201cdisguise.\u201d \n\n\nAnyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn\u2019t care, because he gets to be the hero and that\u2019s what matters most to him.\n\n\nTime passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can\u2019t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.\n\n\nThen the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.\n\nI then relate the client\u2019s self care to their \u201cPeter Parker\u201d and their desire to be there and care for others to their \u201cSpiderman,\u201d to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.\n\n\nA seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around.

We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. \n\nTwo years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/kgnSLWt",

It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn\u2019t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books.

It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, \" I LOVE YOU STAN!\".\n\nI didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, \"Love you too!\".\n \nMany years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. \nOnce our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. \n\nOut of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. \n\nStan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.\n\nEdit: Last thoughts. ",

It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, &quot; I LOVE YOU STAN!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, &quot;Love you too!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. \nOnce our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn&#39;t hear me but it didn&#39;t matter. </p>\n\n<p>Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. </p>\n\n<p>Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Last thoughts. </p>\n</div>",

There is no hall H, there is no special panel that you wait days to get into. They were holding a panel on a stage on the show floor and Mr. Lee came up to say a speech and nice things, etc. It was cute and funny. He wound up forgetting to say his signature word which garnered some disappointment until someone said \"EXCELSIOR!\" And Mr. Lee goes, \"Oh!... EXCELSIOR!\" Everyone laughed and cheered. It was one of the most strange things in to hear in real life. I regret not taking the few hours to wait and meet him and shake his hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRIP Stan Lee, I won't forget that memory. It was a good one.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I went to LACC a couple years ago, it was the first year it was rebranded as &quot;Stan Lee&#39;s LA Comic Con&quot; as opposed to Comikaze. That&#39;s kind of aside the point though. There is no hall H, there is no special panel that you wait days to get into. They were holding a panel on a stage on the show floor and Mr. Lee came up to say a speech and nice things, etc. It was cute and funny. He wound up forgetting to say his signature word which garnered some disappointment until someone said &quot;EXCELSIOR!&quot; And Mr. Lee goes, &quot;Oh!... EXCELSIOR!&quot; Everyone laughed and cheered. It was one of the most strange things in to hear in real life.
