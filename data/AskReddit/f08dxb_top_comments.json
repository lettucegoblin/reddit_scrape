I ended up squatting in a shared college house where no one really controlled enough of the house to take the lead to kick me out and most people just kinda saw their rooms as their control areas. So although I was a bit of a parasite, I wasn't \"on the streets\" type of homeless. Though, I was only eating a bowl of rice per day. Sometimes two. Fast forward to my birthday, my dad sends me $100. I pay $70 of it to people I'd borrowed from. The rest I spend at yard sales that weekend. I buy an unopened game of Cranium for $1, sell it for $15 on eBay. I buy a tennis racket for .50, sell it for $5 to a middle eastern dude that was new to the country and wanted one for his wall. This became an income for me. My average was about $1,600/mo (net) profit) going to thrift stores and yard sales. Then I was able to get a place and a vehicle. Then I tried new businesses. Snow shoveling. It was fine, but not something I wanted to grow. I did enough to get by. Mobile car detailing, tried with my friend. Again, a profitable business, all sweat equity, but we only worked as much as we needed to get by. I wanted something I enjoyed. At this point, I was living off of vats of one meal for each week. One week it might be chili. Another might be pasta. Whatever was cheap and I could make all at once. Then, I invented my product. Spent $5,000 to bring it from ideation to mass production. I built a business out of it. Now  (3 years after my ideation) I'm at a good six figures per year. I pay myself $1,500-$2,000/month. Not a lot. Why? Because I'm still re-investing. I'm still uncomfortable with the income. It's not secure enough. It's not long term enough. My products can be obsolete, so I need to establish long term safety nets. I have, since my first invention, produced 3 more original products, with 6 more in the pipeline due to complete this year. I am fairly confident that I'll break a million next year.\n\nTo re-iterate the parent OP, I have been there at one point. If not lower than the average person has ever been. I am surrounded by friends that are business owners as well from various entrepreneur groups or just business contacts. Most of them didn't come from very wealthy families. A lot of them didn't even go to college. Hell, a couple of them (both in construction/contracting, oddly enough) didn't even finish high school. But they had good business strategies, they had good financial management, etc. I've lived, for a prolonged period of time, low income enough to know how to budget and shop. Winco for groceries. Thrift stores for clothing. 50% used tires for my car. Used cell phones, used furniture, used vehicles, renting a room in a shared house instead of a condo/apt/home, drinking Costco alcohol at home and not going to bars, not dining out, etc. It's a lot of lifestyle management but if you play your cards right and have a strategy or good financial management, it should only be temporary. This doesn't even just apply to business owners. I have a friend that works at a job with no college degree. It is well paying because it's a popular tech mfg. company but in 2 years of working there, he's saved up over $50k just because he is extremely frugal. You don't have to become a business owner to have financial security. You just need to learn to manage your finances and not buy the newest of everything, name brand everything, etc.",
