The remainder of their multi-year tenure with the company was spent doing whatever they wanted save the 10-15 minutes weekly to run their program and to answer the odd email here and there. All while getting paid full salary and benefits. They actually had to add in a few errors now and then to make it seem realistic.</p>\n</div>",

One of my main tasks was to make calculation about how many people enlisted for a course, how many of them got discounts (unemployeds e.g.), how many men/women/age etc. That was needed to calculate upcoming courses fees etc. That was my only work there and I hated it.\n\nThis was in early 90s, so PCs were a thing in our offices but I had no idea how to write a program or use a database to use this informations. Lucky as I am our center had an interesting policy: when you want to educate yourself, you can attend that class for free. And when it's during the worktime, then this is worktime - as long as my supervisor is ok with that. She was.\n\nSo I spent 3 months \"studying\" database structures, scripting, coding etc. I told my tutor what I wanna do and he helped me to write a script that grabs all necessary informations from the courses-database, copy that into another database and then I went crazy and wrote code that was insane. I implemented \"what if\" scenarios thanks to filters. At the end I was able to do my work, that needed 6hrs a day within 15 minuntes. I mean, before that it took e.g. an hour to have all the necessary informations to have a \"how many unemployed single parent women does it need to make the costs of that course even. I had EVERYTHING back then. Now you want statistics how many single parent disabled foreign women at the age of 80-90 are needed for the next 2 years to keep the ornithology course running? Sure, no problem. Clickety-Click, done.\n\nAfter that, I started the PC in the morning, grabbed all the data, ran my script, was done within 15 mins and then read the book I brought from home. At the end of the day I gave my supervisor several dozens of papers, statistics, predictions etc and said \"That was a lot of work!!\" and went home.

I **did** go back and scroll through that first document to ensure I hadn't missed anything due to a goof in the software or anything like that.\n\nnear the end of my second day, I was called into my bosses' office and asked what I'd been doing the past two days. turns out, as of day two, I was churning through five or six times the amount of documents a day compared to people who'd been working there for years. my boss assumed I was just clicking through new documents without doing any work and was very much acting like he had caught me red-handed.\n\nI asked if they reviewed the documents I finished to ensure that I'd done the work. he replied that they hadn't, but, it was obviously impossible to go through that many pages in the time it took me to do it. I told him that I knew for a fact that if he went through any of my work, he'd see everything was fine.\n\nhe pulled one of my finished documents at random, and spent several minutes scrolling through it, shaking his head to himself, staring daggers at the screen. he admitted that this document was fine, but, it would take hours for his assistant manager to review all my work.\n\n\"Can I show you something?

        "body": "Back in my IT consulting days working at an MSP, we had a client with about 180 users who needed new PC's prepped and ready to go for a round of new hires when they were expanding their workforce.  They were adding 40 employees and thus needed 40 workstations prepped. I was assigned the ticket and my boss quoted them 80 hours of work (2h per PC).\n\nThe standard procedure my boss had set up back then was a 3 page checklist to run through for each PC, what software was needed for which group, reminders for installing update s since Dell workstations out of the box aren't always current with updates, and more. Basically it was a terribly long, arduous, manual approach to windows deployment. \n\nSo instead of  following the standard procedure, I decided I was going to automate it all. The first 2 days unboxed 1 PC, prepped it with all the basic items needed for all workstations and then cloned it to another PC. Day 3 I built off of the first image i created which had some more specialized software for a specific subgroup of these new hires. Once that was complete, I was ready to deploy. \n\nI configured the 'WDS' (Windows deployment server) role and had everything ready to go. I brought in a 24 port switch, hooked all PC's up for 2 rounds of 20 deployments, and on day 4, by lunch, I had all workstations complete. All the while my bosses kept checking in to see what was up and why I only had 2 PCs prepped as of the end of day 3. After lunch on day 4, I called to check in and informed them the job was complete.

They were adding 40 employees and thus needed 40 workstations prepped. I was assigned the ticket and my boss quoted them 80 hours of work (2h per PC).</p>\n\n<p>The standard procedure my boss had set up back then was a 3 page checklist to run through for each PC, what software was needed for which group, reminders for installing update s since Dell workstations out of the box aren&#39;t always current with updates, and more. Basically it was a terribly long, arduous, manual approach to windows deployment. </p>\n\n<p>So instead of  following the standard procedure, I decided I was going to automate it all. The first 2 days unboxed 1 PC, prepped it with all the basic items needed for all workstations and then cloned it to another PC. Day 3 I built off of the first image i created which had some more specialized software for a specific subgroup of these new hires. Once that was complete, I was ready to deploy. </p>\n\n<p>I configured the &#39;WDS&#39; (Windows deployment server) role and had everything ready to go. I brought in a 24 port switch, hooked all PC&#39;s up for 2 rounds of 20 deployments, and on day 4, by lunch, I had all workstations complete. All the while my bosses kept checking in to see what was up and why I only had 2 PCs prepped as of the end of day 3. After lunch on day 4, I called to check in and informed them the job was complete. Their response was  to have me just hang out at the clients office for the next week or so which gave me a decent amount of downtime back then to work on things I wanted to.</p>\n</div>",

Keep in mind I was an early-20's nobody who had managed nothing at that point. The prospect of working days (wearing a suit and tie, gah) and managing people did not appeal to me, so I politely declined.\n\nHe said, well, let me sweeten the offer.

Often times we&#39;ll sit on a task for a long time just kinda &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;stewing it over&quot; before presenting a finished product that does exactly what it needs to do as efficiently as possible with as few steps as necessary.  </p>\n\n<p>I mean heck, one time I was tasked with making the department&#39;s deployment process for all their websites automated so I literally created an application to do it with a single button click. 52 web apps and sites, fully deployed and approved with a keystroke. Gonna continue browsing reddit now.</p>\n</div>",

My buddy who is the star of this story was my roommate in college and was the kind of guy that kept a cane by his bed, and hung beads from the ceiling fan so he could adjust without getting up.\n\nHe worked in a Software role at a finance company. As I understand it he did a lot of data mining, where he would be given large amounts of data in different data bases and had to turn this data into usable information in a few different reports. He had enough work to keep him busy for 8 hours a day, but my buddy being very good at SW was able to write a program that automated about 95% of his job. He wrote this Software on his own time and was in compliance with all his IT directions when installing it on the computer. When he would come in to work in the morning he would go to his 30 minute meeting, return to his office and start the SW. He would then spend the next 7 hours reading a book and at the end of the day do a quick review of the reports and send them out. He did this for about a year and got great reviews at work, everyone was happy with his performance.\n\nWhen it was time for him to move on to another job (Better pay, more interesting, and as he said, I can only read so many books) he told his bosses about this program and offered to sell it the company so they did not need to hire a replacement. His offer was 25k, which is quite reasonable since his salary was more then double that. The company thinking there were smart figured the SW was already on the computer and he had showed them how it worked, they would just end his employment on that day and take it for free.\n\nWhat his company didn't know is my friend doesn't trust people and built into the Software that once a month he had to enter some Password or the SW would shut down. About 3 weeks after they let him go they called offering him 25k for the Password, but at this point he was pissed, and was countered with 50k. After some back and forth I think they settled on 40k. Nice payday for him.",

        "body": "I\u2019m not sure this is the exact same thing but something quite similar. I worked at Pizza Hut when I was in high school, from Freshman year all the way up until right after graduation. I was a cook and was very lazy back then. I didn\u2019t do my job bad, in fact I made a point to be better then every other cook, I\u2019d be done making several pizzas with them in the oven and be on my phone or flirting with the waitresses before other cooks could even lay the pepperoni. \n\nI knew that if you sucked they would push you harder so I made a point to do my job well enough that I didn\u2019t get bothered.\n\nI had a really cool manager for the first 3 and a half years, she would smoke pot with us behind the store and shit but then would challenge us to races of pizza making when things got busy. She ended up getting fired over something or other and they transferred in some old lady who had been with the company since the dawn of pizza, she was all about every rule being followed perfectly and took no shit. She also didn\u2019t smoke weed so that was lame. She was like the district manager for another district and was on her way to retirement so they gave her our store basically.\n\nAt first she hated me cuz I was a young smart ass and she tried to take away all my shifts that were on the busiest times, but after realizing everyone sucked she finally put me back on Fridays and weekends.

I worked at Pizza Hut when I was in high school, from Freshman year all the way up until right after graduation. I was a cook and was very lazy back then. I didn\u2019t do my job bad, in fact I made a point to be better then every other cook, I\u2019d be done making several pizzas with them in the oven and be on my phone or flirting with the waitresses before other cooks could even lay the pepperoni. </p>\n\n<p>I knew that if you sucked they would push you harder so I made a point to do my job well enough that I didn\u2019t get bothered.</p>\n\n<p>I had a really cool manager for the first 3 and a half years, she would smoke pot with us behind the store and shit but then would challenge us to races of pizza making when things got busy. She ended up getting fired over something or other and they transferred in some old lady who had been with the company since the dawn of pizza, she was all about every rule being followed perfectly and took no shit. She also didn\u2019t smoke weed so that was lame. She was like the district manager for another district and was on her way to retirement so they gave her our store basically.</p>\n\n<p>At first she hated me cuz I was a young smart ass and she tried to take away all my shifts that were on the busiest times, but after realizing everyone sucked she finally put me back on Fridays and weekends. Luckily my goal to not be bothered had actually made me an excellent employee I suppose, I followed all the rules before she even tried to tell me.</p>\n\n<p>So a moment I\u2019m actually still proud of today, 10 years later, I was preparing a bunch of pizzas on a morning shift, just get the dough ready, sauce, and cheese.

By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.

Needless to say, even the people who are supposed to be the \u201csuper users\u201d don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. \n\nMy lead is trying to find me all of the patients who have a certain chronic condition and gives me a list she pulled from our old charting system. The problem is that I need to call people who haven\u2019t been into the office in 3 months and the data is 6 months old. I asked her why she didn\u2019t just pull the registry from the new system and she says there\u2019s no way to do it. We\u2019ll just have to go through each patient individually to see when the last time they were in. \n\nIt took me all of 10 minutes to figure out how to pull a registry, sort by last visit, and sort by payor. \n\nShe said she still wanted me to use the only list because \u201cwe can\u2019t trust the data from the registries\u201d.

(Gotta get the right stain so double coverage doesn't show). The first year it saved zero time, but 15 years later he is a month ahead.\n\nOne day I walk in to the shop and find his riding mower parked on my welding table in a room with a low ceiling. (He didn't want to bend over to work on it.)  He didn't use a forklift, won't fit b/c low ceiling, and he didn't use ramps.  I pondered on that one for a couple of weeks.  I'm too prideful to ask.  I'm back in the shop and I lean against my 300 pound welding table and damn near fall down; He had put wheels on the table and rolled it to a high ceiling, used the forklift and rolled it back.\n\nWork smart not hard.  And if they don't sell the tool you need anywhere build it yourself.\n\nHe would always find a way to automate part of a task physically, even if it didn't pay off soon.  Now he's pushing 80 and retired but I don't dare unload the trucks with material I need or he'll plan and build something before I can turn my back.  \nBoth hips and at least one knee have been replaced, he's going deaf, and half blind, prostate cancer, small cell bladder cancer, chemo, radiation, AAA, heart valves, and a 10ft Chicago brake fell on him 40 years ago breaking his sternum and puncturing a lung.   He has earned his rest but I will bet everything I will ever own he passes away in someone else's yard helping them.  It's not in him to stop or quit.  So lazy is the last word I would ever use on him.  20+ years of doing things the hard way, 20+ years of wearing out your body will force you to change gears and use your brain.  That is a lesson I wish I didn't know so well.  Learned it with my eyes 30 years ago, but now I feel it in my bones.  Stay in school kids.",
