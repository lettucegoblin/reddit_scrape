You'd normally be wise to not believe anything any throwaway account writes, especially considering the track record they have in regards to this show/network.\n2. If you disregard the first point, please don't let me or anyone else get your hopes up.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say this: I know and have worked with several people who work above the line at HBO, and this idea of redoing season 8 (not season 7, as far as I've heard) isn't as far fetched as some of you might think. They've not only discussed it, they've had actual **meetings** about it, **recently**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe people at WarnerMedia as well as Casey Bloys and Robert Greenblatt (who's also not happy about any of the proposed spinoff GoT shows) are furious with D&D and the direction of the show. Not necessarily with the story/plot/writing (although I'm sure they aren't thrilled with those either) but with the decision to end the show at season 8. HBO obviously wants to milk this thing for all it's worth, so when D&D came to them and pitched the idea of ending the show sooner rather than later they were initially not on board at all. D&D won out and got their 8 seasons with the promise that the last season would be a massive cultural phenomena akin to season 1's Ned Stark beheading or the Red Wedding. Obviously, that hasn't been the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's what I know, now let me talk about what YOU can do to change things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor starters, pensions like these are good, but I'd suggest a different approach. Make it clear that you're giving HBO an ultimatum - Promise them you'll continue your subscription to their various services (whichever one you use) during this \"off season\" **IF** they redo season 8 (again, I've heard no talks of redoing S7, personally I wouldn't push for that). Failure to meet this will result in them losing you as a customer. Simple, right? HBO is already slated to lose millions of subscriptions once S8 ends, but a large, organized campaign would only exacerbate this number. I'd make sure to word these pensions as respectfully as possible, but also be firm and make it clear that this is an ultimatum, and not a request.\n\nTo anyone who's worked in/pays close attention to the industry; you're correct for thinking this is all super far fetched. No one redos shows or movies like this - it's unheard of. The thing is that HBO prides themselves on doing groundbreaking stuff. Killing your protagonist at the end of the first season is still a big deal today. They do have balls, and they like that that's their reputation.\n\nAnyways, my plane is about to land and I have no idea if this will get buried or what. I'm posting it here because r/freefolk is the only GoT community big and eccentric enough to get a thing like this done. The chance of this happening is small, but I'm not lying or wrong when I say there is a chance. Do what you internet-savy people do: Start a hashtag, do a social media, do a google bomb ( I learned that one from you guys), start that pension, and make it all viral. We could see three more seasons of this show WITH the same cast, crew, and a couple new, competent writers/showrunners.",

If there is, make history and make it happen. Pay the actors what they want. This is the Harry Potter of this decade and it\u2019s about to end in the worst fashion imaginable. </p>\n\n<p>The arrogance of those show runners to do this to the show? Who, other than in their tight circle of two thought this was a good idea? Who was their sounding board and why did nobody speak up?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m so sad. Honestly, genuinely, sad. I know it\u2019s only a TV show, but imagine the vet amputated three of your dog\u2019s legs instead of routine injections.</p>\n</div>",

Surely it couldn't be the characters and story! The GoT characters are arguably more interesting and dynamic than most if not all of the characters in Star Wars.\n\nStar Wars is strictly a good v. evil story. No inbetween.
