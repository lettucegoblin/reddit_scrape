The story rounded out excellently, and now I just want to rewatch the show again, something I never expected I'd do. When you tell a great, cohesive story that is just as solid through all parts, it makes me thrilled to watch it again.\n\nGame of Thrones, on the other hand, was easy to watch. Scene on scene, it was entertaining and thrilling. This was lessened in the later seasons, with the story of seasons 5-7 being the tryhard brother of the first 4. But I didn't really care. I watched seasons 1-7 multiple times. \n\nBut then season 8 came out.\n\nThere was no payoff for the journey we had gone through. The ending was unsatisfying and, at times, nonsensical. I'm sure I will go rewatch the earlier seasons at some point, because they are a masterpiece, but it feels decidedly more hollow now, knowing that there's no point to any of this. I no longer have the same drive to watch them that I used to, and that fucking sad. \n\nGo watch Breaking Bad everybody. You may love every second of it, or, like me, you may struggle sometimes.

It may have been a bit of a deus ex machina, but it felt like an earned one, with all the crazy stuff with Starbuck and Anders. I felt like it picked up really well from how dull and meandering most of the third season was after the escape from New Caprica. The writers strike was a big hurdle, too. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying the ending was perfect and there are parts that i&#39;m still kinda ticked about, but very few shows pull off completely satisfying endings. As time goes by, i&#39;m just glad that i don&#39;t remember BSG in the same vein as Lost and Game of Thrones.</p>\n</div>",

Destroying Stannis\u2019s army off screen.\n\n2. Reviving Jon with oogity boogity arms and no form of personal sacrifice (personally I think the moment would\u2019ve been more effective had they slit Ghost\u2019s throat in that scene).\n\n3. Arya\u2019s surviving multiple chest stab wounds that kill every other character.\n\n4. Varys travelling so fast across the planet that he zips from Mereen to Dorne  in just a few scenes just so he can reveal himself to the camera, then, before the next scene, he has enough time to travel back to Mereen so he can be on the ship coming back to Westeros. Does no one remember how journeys used to be part of the story? There was a whole episode devoted to Ned\u2019s, Arya\u2019s and Sanaa\u2019s travelling on the King\u2019s Road. Fuck, Tyrion spent almost the whole first season just trying to get back to Kings Landing.\n\n5. Season Seven\u2019s endless fan services reunions. After  years of all the characters spread across the planet chasing different objectives, they all came to fall into two groups of the good guys versus Cersei. And it was then that you realised how bloated the character list was. But instead of giving those characters individual plot lines they were given all these crowd pleasing \u201cHey, I remember you,\u201d scenes, which might be fine if there weren\u2019t so fucking many of them.\n\n6. What the fuck did bringing a wight  to Kings Landing achieve? It lost them a dragon and gained a plot armoured Lannister. This of course followed the idea that the war with Cersei was less important than the war against the dead. Of course it turns out the Cersei was right.\n\n8. Forgot to mention: Jon\u2019s resurrection giving him all that plot armour in the Battle of the Bastards.",
