I checked the backyard security camera and saw the driver come back down the ally, reach through the gate, and grab the package. \n\nI was so furious. 30 minutes later I\u2019m about to contact Amazon but decide maybe I should look around again.

She must have seen our \u201cDeliver to front porch\u201d sign after taking the picture and marking it delivered. \n\nThere\u2019s some GPS service that for some reason takes the delivery drivers (not just Amazon) to the back alley. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but often enough we got a sign for it. \n\nThere was one time Amazon marked my package delivered, but the picture was not my porch.

The hours are insane and unpredictable (one day I\u2019d start at 1 am, the next day 5 am, and you don\u2019t find out what time you start until 1 pm the day before) and it\u2019s hard work, but they pay really well and damn do they get shit done. USPS has been so backlogged due to covid that they\u2019re months behind, things are taking 3 months to ship, so FedEx stepped in to take a good chunk of their workload. Package #s are already insane due to people online shopping during lockdown, plus taking extra to help the post office, and they\u2019re still shipping right on time like it\u2019s just another Tuesday.
