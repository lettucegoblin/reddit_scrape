There was another video where he made his stepson slap his daughter across the face and the kid hesitated and said, &quot;but, she&#39;s a girl, I can&#39;t hit girls,&quot; to which DO5 said, &quot;she&#39;s your sister, she doesn&#39;t count.&quot; Then Cody came home from school with a note because he was self-harming and DO5 recorded himself screaming at Cody and telling him he&#39;s faking it. Another video, he&#39;s dragging Emma up the stairs and he tells the step son to turn the camera off. I got so sick to my stomach at that. I&#39;m so glad they got banned from YouTube and that Cody and Emma were brought back to their biological mother.</p>\n</div>",
