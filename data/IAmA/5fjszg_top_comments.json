The hole is the place where people at the international base were kept 24/7 under guard. There was a big conference room that had a big table in it and the carpet there was industrial strength carpet and people, myself included, were made to crawl around on their hands and knees around this big table and eventually your hands become bloodied and your knees become bloodied and the next day you\u2019re doing it again, so it never really heals. I still have a little scar on my left knee from doing that.\n\nLeah: And that was just usual? That was just everyday?\n\nMike Rinder: Yeah.\n\nLeah: Other than being punched and slapped and ridiculed?\n\nMike Rinder: Yup.\n\nLeah: When I was in Scientology, I used to hear information about Sea Org members saying that they were abused. I remember thinking if that were true then the police would be raiding this place and the FBI would be doing something. If this were true, how come no one has done anything about it? And I want you to talk about that.\n\nMike Rinder: The primary reason is because people within in Scientology are indoctrinated heavily. The law enforcement, the FBI, the police, they\u2019re all horrible, suppressive people. So, the concept of even going to them is something that just never enters the mind of a Scientologist. \n\nLeah: Not to mention, your doctrine says if you prosecute a Scientologist, you will be expelled and shunned.

I had a few hours, so I decided why the hell not, so i gave a fake name and joined a tour. \nThey said the most absurd and unbelievable things such as \"LRH studied under over 20 different religious leaders from different countries by the time he was 19\" and \"This is a painting with LRH and the last of the chinese wizard dynasty.\" I kept asking questions like \"How did he learn to speak the different languages so fast\" or \"Did the wizards have wands.\" Every time the answer was \"He had the power to unlock the mind\" or \"He just could.\"\nIt got really bizarre about half way through the tour and the guide explained that the worst thing we could do was not have children. She then did a audit thing and showed us a really extravagant display of LRH's life awards. I took a video of a lot of the tour without them noticing. \nSorry for the long post, it was just a very odd experience",

        "body": "I'm so glad you commented because one of the things I really enjoyed about being on the ship was the stuff actually having to do with running the ship, and I'm very curious if my experience is at all similar to those of actual sailors.  \n\nSo, there are technically two orgs on the Freewinds - the one that delivers all of the Scientology services, and the one that handles running the actual ship.  The latter has/had a guy in charge who was always kind to me, and I believe he had been a merchant marine at one point.  All of the engineers, cabin cleaners, handymen, deckhands were under him.  At one point when I was put on manual labor, I did work in the engine room for a bit, specifically cleaning scavenger spaces, which they consider one of the worst jobs (and why I was given it - I was in trouble).  I also, at one point, had to help clean and paint bilges.  It was pretty bad too, but after we were done, I often daydreamed about hiding out down there.\n\nWe'd did have watches!  Members in both orgs were assigned to watches.  Generally, a schedule was put up a few hours before we were underway and we'd just look for our watch team on the schedule.  A watch was two hours if I recall correctly.  We mostly sailed overnight so I had a lot of watches from like 2am-4am etc.  Everyone on a watch specialized, sometimes in more than one thing.  You'd train under someone who was more experienced and we also had courses we'd complete to get \"certified\".  I was a \"certified\" lookout, and was training to be a helmsman.  Some of my best memories are pulling into port at like 6 in the morning when the sun is just coming up and the air is cool, and I could watch the deck crew tie on the ship.  Underways were rarely over 8 hours, but sometimes if we were going to a new set of islands, they'd be a couple of days.  We'd generally stay within a close group of islands, like Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao for a few weeks, and then move to a new group.\n\nI lived in basically a dorm room with bunks and lockers.  I had five other roommates.  Obviously it was really small.  Some other crew members lived in nicer rooms with maybe only one to three other people, and they had bigger storage space and curtains on their bunks.  I just never got moved into one of those rooms.  Communal showers were down the hall and we were supposed to shower in 30 seconds or less, but unless there was a wait, it wasn't strictly enforced.  Bathrooms were in the hall too.\n\nWe ate in a cafeteria.  Generally the food was pretty good - lots of fresh fruit and a variety of food to choose from, but there were definitely times when we were told that the org didn't have enough money and we were put on beans and rice.  At the time, I thought it made sense since maybe the ship was only at a quarter capacity or something, but now that I'm out and I'm aware of how the senior management live, it makes me so angry - such hypocrites.\n\nOK, so a typical morning for us, would be muster on the top deck, then we would a morning chore that we were assigned prior.  Mine was cleaning one of the public bathrooms.  Then we had another muster and would do ship drills.  Sometimes it would be lifeboat drills where we would lower and raise the lifeboats. I was an engineer for those, which basically just meant I started the engine.  Sometimes it would be teaming up with a partner and taking turns making our way up from our bunk on our hands and knees and blindfolded.  Sometimes it would be a two minute drill, where we would go to our bunks and the drill would sound and we'd have to be up at our emergency stations within two minutes. \n\nAfter ship drills, we would have 30 minutes to shower and get dressed and be on post (at our job), which started at 9 am.  I'd work until 6:30 and then go study Scientology courses in the course room until 9, and then usually go work a bit more.  I tended to get off of work around midnight most nights.  Sometimes I wouldn't study for weeks on end, so I'd be working from 9 AM until Midnight seven days a week.  It just depended.  \n\nThis has gotten really long, I realize so I'll end it there, but feel free to ask any other questions.  ",
