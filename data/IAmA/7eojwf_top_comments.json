        "body": "I'll say this one more time:\n\n\"Net neutrality\" is not what's up for repeal.  What's being debated is a repeal to classifying ISPs as public utilities. What that does is lovely things like requiring federal oversight in order to lay new fiber. That means only the big players like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon have the resources necessary to jump through the legal hoops to get new fiber approved. Title II also removes FTC oversight from ISPs, which -- among other things -- lets them sell your personal data to third parties.\n\nSo-called \"Net Neutrality\" is everything reddit opposes. But, of course, Soros-funded operations with Orwellian names like \"Fight for the Future\" and \"Battle for the Net\" are so effective they've got people convinced that black is white and down is up. Read the Communications Act of 1934 for yourself. Title II begins on page 35. It doesn't even explicitly forbid ISPs from charging different amounts for different websites, so that argument is invalid to begin with.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll say this one more time:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Net neutrality&quot; is not what&#39;s up for repeal.  What&#39;s being debated is a repeal to classifying ISPs as public utilities. What that does is lovely things like requiring federal oversight in order to lay new fiber. That means only the big players like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon have the resources necessary to jump through the legal hoops to get new fiber approved. Title II also removes FTC oversight from ISPs, which -- among other things -- lets them sell your personal data to third parties.</p>\n\n<p>So-called &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; is everything reddit opposes. But, of course, Soros-funded operations with Orwellian names like &quot;Fight for the Future&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Net&quot; are so effective they&#39;ve got people convinced that black is white and down is up. Read the Communications Act of 1934 for yourself. Title II begins on page 35. It doesn&#39;t even explicitly forbid ISPs from charging different amounts for different websites, so that argument is invalid to begin with.</p>\n</div>",

(Compounded, of course, by voters who are swayed by ads and don&#39;t bother to actually research the candidates impartially)</p>\n</div>",
