While people can't afford 900 dollar pills because they have a disability that they could not help; the chopping block has programs of the health of the people square in its sights but not something as suspect as this?

Not to mention, the places ISP's own that are news outlets had little to no coverage at all about a vote that changes everything.\n\nDespite all of this, and despite the FCC being an independent sect of government; multiple officials were denied entry even through the door, two million stolen identities confirmed before the vote even happened, over twenty-four million comments, letters, and outcrys with and estimated 83% favor of keeping Title 2, all of this was neither entered as fact nor even a concern save for the only two representing the people in the room who voted no and jokes about language and comment from Sir Spud about looking like a \"potato\" and retorts from the benefactor in-cheif about ads and promoted tweets already happening.\n\nFirst, that's offensive; a potato has more substance and is a food many people like. Second, if the ads were running and promoted tweets were against the rules of Net Neutrality; you should probably resign as this admission was a direct statement claiming knowledge of misconduct from companies in public view without any punishment or investigation by the head of the FCC himself. Knowledge of an act against a department of government's law without action seems like a crime right? It is. Just to be clear, it is. Also, if any donations or money or even a half eaten donut were taken as a bribe and at least three were involved, it's not only a crime of accepting a bribe but technically a federal conspiracy to commit a crime. It's called a RICO Conspiracy and all can be charged the same (thank you The Dark Knight for this. It's bad when a movie is more factual than the FCC). \n\nFurthermore, even if they believed in the vote, the country that gives them power is a Democratic nation. If, a government branch of the United States (even if elected to make decisions), makes a decision while publicly ignoring the majority or the public at all for that matter, this would be an act against the people of the country. It's true, it's what we founded the country on in the first place. Remember learning about the Boston Tea Party in grade school? It's fortunate because history is almost not being considered worth teaching in schools yet those same schools require Internet connection for students who are issued laptop's that are mandatory. Today, the Tea is taxed and tainted so much that we have to dump it into the harbor and ask how the Tea keeps ending up in this harbor!\n\nNow despite my own concerns about utilities like water, electrical power, or... say, the INTERNET; there is no question that the Internet is now no longer a convenience, it's a part of everyday life that makes it essential to function. We pretty much made this set in stone when we started giving four year olds Iphones and made it more normal to facetime with your neighbor while playing GTA instead of going outside and like... doing... play. No, slides and swingsets are more obsolete than what the kid on multiplayer say's he's made your mom. We might stomp that little newb into a k/d so low that they throw their controller into a tv, but like it or not, it's how we are evolving. Technology, is the glassware we use to hydrate; the Internet is almost water. That we drink. To live. UTILITY.\n\nIt's the day after the vote to take away something that has become a part of us and put a fee inside a hidden fee on it. The Senate is next, after that it will already be violent because the changes will start stacking and the people won't even vote. It'll be 88 mph all the way to the steps that lead to a nation. This why history is so important, we learn from our mistakes, we use what we learn to avoid more mistakes, we grow and in the process try not to start actually battles over something that brings people together like the Internet should.\n\nIf you skipped or made it this far, I fully support the overturn of the vote yesterday and pursue criminal action for infringement upon our civil liberties, rights that founded this very nation.",

We pretty much made this set in stone when we started giving four year olds Iphones and made it more normal to facetime with your neighbor while playing GTA instead of going outside and like... doing... play. No, slides and swingsets are more obsolete than what the kid on multiplayer say&#39;s he&#39;s made your mom. We might stomp that little newb into a k/d so low that they throw their controller into a tv, but like it or not, it&#39;s how we are evolving. Technology, is the glassware we use to hydrate; the Internet is almost water. That we drink. To live. UTILITY.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the day after the vote to take away something that has become a part of us and put a fee inside a hidden fee on it. The Senate is next, after that it will already be violent because the changes will start stacking and the people won&#39;t even vote. It&#39;ll be 88 mph all the way to the steps that lead to a nation. This why history is so important, we learn from our mistakes, we use what we learn to avoid more mistakes, we grow and in the process try not to start actually battles over something that brings people together like the Internet should.</p>\n\n<p>If you skipped or made it this far, I fully support the overturn of the vote yesterday and pursue criminal action for infringement upon our civil liberties, rights that founded this very nation.</p>\n</div>",

Well...they already do. And they don&#39;t ask permission, or even tell you they&#39;re going to do it. </p>\n\n<p>Will this stifle creativity and ingenuity? I&#39;m doubtful. It didn&#39;t before &quot;Net Neutrality&quot;. In fact, everything the internet is, was mostly developed before the government decided they wanted to regulate an already free internet. In fact, Net Neutrality strikes me as an attempt to control the internet and stifle that freedom. Unless you can point out the last time our government got together and gave, not took, our freedoms...</p>\n\n<p>Government control of almost anything, except for safety regulations and a scant few environmental regulations, is a bad thing. It stifles creativity and hampers progress.

Under the new regime Comcast can privilege its own affiliated content crowding out newcomers and other media.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, will it be legal for comcast (for example) to throttle all other services other than NBC or would that be considered anti-competitive?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s call this an open question. I&#39;ll note that this kind of anti-trust litigation can take years during which companies like Comcast can reap the benefits of gaming the network. This is why bright line rules are better than post-hoc enforcement. </p>\n</div>",

You say that the FCC failed to properly follow the APA. What sections and/or clauses of the APA are you asserting that they failed to follow? More specifically, can you tell me what legal arguments you would make in response to this comment by /u/InquisitorialRetinue posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/7josxi/18_attorneys_general_ask_fcc_to_delay_net/dr8enu4/) and reproduced below.\n\n> Based on what procedural mandate, and on what theory? The AGs can\u2019t even cite the APA correctly (\u201cProcedure\u201d is not plural). How is this different from interest groups urging the writing of form letters to an agency making identical points, most of which are disregarded by agency staff anyway? (The agency need only consider a significant point, not its redundant iterations.)\n\n> For one, it\u2019s not a popularity contest. See, e.g., U.S. Cellular Corp. v. FCC, 254 F.3d 78, 87 (D.C.

For two, the APA \u201chas never been interpreted to require the agency to respond to every comment, or to analyse every issue or alternative raised by the comments, no matter how insubstantial.\u201d Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see also Vermont Yankee (\u201cadministrative proceedings should not be a game or a forum to engage in unjustified obstructionism by making cryptic and obscure reference to matters that \u2018ought to be\u2019 considered and then, after failing to do more to bring the matter to the agency\u2019s attention, seeking to have that agency determination vacated on the ground that the agency failed to consider matters \u2018forcefully presented.\u2019\u201d).\n\n> Here, the AGs point to comment spam, but then don\u2019t elaborate on how they are material to the validity of the proposed rule. They don\u2019t even articulate a theory! Sure sounds to me like cryptic obstruction of the Vermont Yankee variety.\n\nWhile this comment is pointed at halting/pausing the vote on the repeal due to the allegedly fraudulent comments, the cited case law (as well as precedential case law such as Citizen's United) does make a compelling argument in favor of the FCC. And, as an engineer, given the standard of arbitrary and capricious, it seems like the FCC has provided enough information to jump that incredibly low hurdle. So while I think it's the wrong outcome, the law does seem to indicate that the FCC will win.\n\nLong story short, I would like to know how you all are planning to respond to those rules and arguments and what other legal theories/arguments you are planning on posing.\n\nThanks!",
