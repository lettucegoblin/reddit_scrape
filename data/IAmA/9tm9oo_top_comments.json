However here in the Bay Area you have, a few times now, endorsed candidates for state office who strongly oppose policies to bring in new high density housing construction. (Specifically Jane Kim and Jovanka Beckles). Job growth has occurred rapidly here but construction of new housing has failed to meet that burden, and the result has been rapidly increasing rents and housing costs, with disastrous results for the working class.\n\nWith your endorsements, you've aligned yourself with candidates who support policies that will exacerbate this scarcity.\n\nWhat is your position on urban housing development, and its role in housing affordability in areas with rapid job growth? Do you support higher residential density in urban areas with low carbon emissions and good public transit? Or should America continue its pattern of suburban sprawl and accompanying auto emissions and habitat loss? If you do support higher density, how do you reconcile that with your endorsements?",

I was fortunate enough to attend your rally at the UW campus that year. It was magnificent!\n\nOne of the major reasons I supported you, apart from the obvious stuff (Medicare For All, Decriminalizing Cannabis, reigning in Corporate powers), was the fact that you largely have avoided pushing excessive gun control in your home state of Vermont.\n\nAs a racial minority who genuinely isn't sure whether or not I can trust Law Enforcement to protect me, I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, as well as the ownership of commonly owned rifles. I know \"assault weapons\" are a highly contentious point of political conflict, but I would hope that, as a nation, we could discuss the ramifications of reactionary gun laws and the unintended consequences they may have on the American people.\n\nAs you yourself witnessed during the Civil Rights Era, our laws tend to disproportionately impact specific groups, namely racial minorities and the poor. While I do greatly wish to see action taken to reduce gun violence, I have a hard time imagining how criminalizing the ownership of 50+ year old rifles will improve the already divisive nature of our country. Just like our drug laws, new gun laws will impact racial minorities and the poor before it affects those who *truly are* a threat to community safety.\n\nMy question is this: **What can I do, as a left-leaning liberal gun owner, to better highlight my concerns to a Politician willing to listen?** I've sent countless emails and letters to my local representatives, only to be brushed off as an \"NRA Supporter\" or something similar. I despise the NRA for a variety of reasons, and I'm not here to represent their misguided attempts at being true representatives of the American Rifleman. I want a serious dialogue with serious people who are willing to treat this issue with the respect it deserves.\n\nGun ownership is a right that belongs to ALL American people, and I fear that the polarity on this issue will result in further division when we *should* be coming together.\n\nThanks for the AMA!",

The two biggest issues, in my opinion, are bipartisanship and allocation of tax dollars. After that I would say it's dishonest campaigning. What would you recommend is the best solution that voters can impose to fix these issues? Seeing as we are constantly told there is no money for fixing our infrastructure, but we are paying tremendous taxes and many politicians have substantial salaries. And many of us want to get more diverse thinkers in Congress but are stuck with candidates that feel they need to vote with their party which is only one side or the other. \n\nI tend to vote democratic. Right now mostly to even out the two sides, but I don't always agree with just that side.\n\nBtw I caucused for you in Seattle during the last primaries, but our electoral college representative didn't represent our votes. \n\nSincerely, \nDaniel Vaughan",

Unbelievably, in America today, there are states like Oklahoma and Colorado where kids are going to school 4 days a week because of budgetary constraints. How insane is that? Further, we need to move toward universal, affordable childhood pre-K. The bottom line is: instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations we need to fund our schools and respect educators.</p>\n</div>",

And he also explains the difference between a socialized system like the NHS  and a Canadian type system like Bernie suggests.\n\nTo the whole program he says it much better than me, but here's a cost overview: The US is already spending [$3.2 trillion](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf) a year on health care, that's the highest per capita rate in the world.

Instead of going through inefficient middle broker companies:   \n\nLessen the inefficiency and negotiate drug prices to save ~$600 billion. The tax reform costs companies and the 1% the overwhelming bulk of the $[1.6t](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file). That's 2/3^rds (talking generally since we don't have exact scores yet).   \n\nThe other 1/3^rd is what the government already pays for health care, over $1t. \n\nWhen MFA passes much will be paid for by companies and the 1%. There will be better services for the same price because the the inefficiency and power imbalance will be reduced. Also everyone needs services like dental/mental/vision/pharmaceuticals and it's easier to manage & cheaper when done all together.  \n\nIf it's more (still likely a yuge boon) it's nice to know the financing isn't tied to the bill. So the tax strategy can be reevaluated even though like all other programs it comes out of general revenue.

        "body": "The way I see it, platforms often follow a predictable pattern. They start by being good to their users, providing a great experience. But then, they start favoring their business customers, neglecting the very users who made them successful. Unfortunately, this is happening with Reddit. They recently decided to shut down third-party apps, and it's a clear example of this behavior. The way Reddit's management has responded to objections from the communities only reinforces my belief. It's sad to see a platform that used to care about its users heading in this direction.\n\nThat's why I am deleting my account and starting over at *Lemmy*, a new and exciting platform in the online world. Although it's still growing and may not be as polished as Reddit, Lemmy differs in one very important way: it's decentralized. So unlike Reddit, which has a single server (reddit.com) where all the content is hosted, there are many many servers that are all connected to one another.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The way I see it, platforms often follow a predictable pattern. They start by being good to their users, providing a great experience. But then, they start favoring their business customers, neglecting the very users who made them successful. Unfortunately, this is happening with Reddit. They recently decided to shut down third-party apps, and it&#39;s a clear example of this behavior. The way Reddit&#39;s management has responded to objections from the communities only reinforces my belief. It&#39;s sad to see a platform that used to care about its users heading in this direction.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I am deleting my account and starting over at <em>Lemmy</em>, a new and exciting platform in the online world. Although it&#39;s still growing and may not be as polished as Reddit, Lemmy differs in one very important way: it&#39;s decentralized. So unlike Reddit, which has a single server (reddit.com) where all the content is hosted, there are many many servers that are all connected to one another. So you can have your account on <em>lemmy.world</em> and still subscribe to content on Lemmy<strong>NSFW</strong>.com (Yes that is NSFW, you are warned/welcome).

Rather than having bosses and workers it means having democratic control over the factories and shops to as great a degree as you can.\n\n- [He spoke about alienation, and the necessity of worker ownership at the 1985 Progressive Entrepreneurship Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXtGK9sQUvM)\n\n- [In this 1985 interview, he defended the gains of the Cuban Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14lsC4WLV0)\n\n- [He wrote the following in a now defunct magazine called Vermont Affairs, in 1986](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265):\n\n>All that socialism means to me, to be very frank with you, is democracy with a small \u2018d.\u2019 I believe in democracy, and by democracy I mean that, to as great an extent as possible, human beings have the right to control their own lives. And that means that you cannot separate the political structure from the economic structure...So if you believe in political democracy, if you believe in equality, you have to believe in economic democracy as well ... You reach a certain age when you start reading reasonably widely, and you find ideas that reflect your gut feeling about something...You find what you\u2019re looking for. I had that feeling when I first read Eugene Debs, for example. If you read what Debs said about the goals of socialism, it\u2019s no different from what I\u2019ve been saying. That all socialism is about is democracy.\n\n- [From the 1988 dissertation of Steven Soifer, a professor of social work at the University of Memphis, who wrote about Sanders\u2019 time as mayor of Burlington, Bernie is quoted as saying](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265):\n\n>What being a socialist means is that you hold out a vision of society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed but on cooperation where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.\n\n- [In 1989, he clearly stated his status as a Socialist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_QLek6Qvzg)\n\n**As a Congressman:**\n\n- [In 1991, he gave a talk at a DSA meeting and spoke about how, in the short term, he believes that the US should catch up with the rest of the world, in terms of Social Democratic policies, but that we should ultimately move towards worker control of the economy, as a long term goal](https://youtu.be/7WWtqYbcefM?t=52m17s)\n\n- [he advocated worker ownership in Congress in 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dKK2ya_JVc)\n\n- [He gave a speech in 2013 about worker Co-ops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDSMaCzjEhs)\n\n**2016-Today:**\n\n- [He advocated worker co-ops in point 3 his 12 point economic plan, put outc during the primary](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html)\n\n- [He denied being a Capitalist on CNN, in a debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCKNtQXGbE) \n\n- [In this Reddit AMA from the Primary, he expresses a clear intent to move towards worker control](https://imgur.com/RF6z4mR) \n\n- He wrote the following in his 2016 book, *Our Revolution* in a section about giving workers control over the Workplace:\n\n>This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better...Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else...The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up (pg 260-261)\n\n- [He introduced legislation to expand co-operatives nationwide in 2017](https://vtdigger.org/2017/05/17/senators-look-take-vermont-worker-owner-effort-nationwide/)\n",

And that means that you cannot separate the political structure from the economic structure...So if you believe in political democracy, if you believe in equality, you have to believe in economic democracy as well ... You reach a certain age when you start reading reasonably widely, and you find ideas that reflect your gut feeling about something...You find what you\u2019re looking for. I had that feeling when I first read Eugene Debs, for example. If you read what Debs said about the goals of socialism, it\u2019s no different from what I\u2019ve been saying. That all socialism is about is democracy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265\">From the 1988 dissertation of Steven Soifer, a professor of social work at the University of Memphis, who wrote about Sanders\u2019 time as mayor of Burlington, Bernie is quoted as saying</a>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What being a socialist means is that you hold out a vision of society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed but on cooperation where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_QLek6Qvzg\">In 1989, he clearly stated his status as a Socialist</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>As a Congressman:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7WWtqYbcefM?t=52m17s\">In 1991, he gave a talk at a DSA meeting and spoke about how, in the short term, he believes that the US should catch up with the rest of the world, in terms of Social Democratic policies, but that we should ultimately move towards worker control of the economy, as a long term goal</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dKK2ya_JVc\">he advocated worker ownership in Congress in 2007</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDSMaCzjEhs\">He gave a speech in 2013 about worker Co-ops</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2016-Today:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html\">He advocated worker co-ops in point 3 his 12 point economic plan, put outc during the primary</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCKNtQXGbE\">He denied being a Capitalist on CNN, in a debate</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/RF6z4mR\">In this Reddit AMA from the Primary, he expresses a clear intent to move towards worker control</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>He wrote the following in his 2016 book, <em>Our Revolution</em> in a section about giving workers control over the Workplace:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This type of greed, and ruthless Capitalism is not an economic model we should be embracing. We can do Better; we must do better...Employee owned enterprises boost morale, because workers share in profits, and have more control over their own work lives. The employees are not simply cogs in a machine owned by someone else...The Workers in these operations understand that when employees own their workplaces, when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the decision-making that impacts their jobs, they are no longer just punching a time clock. They become more motivated, absenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up (pg 260-261)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2017/05/17/senators-look-take-vermont-worker-owner-effort-nationwide/\">He introduced legislation to expand co-operatives nationwide in 2017</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

We quickly blew it all in Denver and had to start getting odd jobs! So, in Denver we canvassed for $12 an hour getting signatures to support the oil industry (feel a lil bad about that one), in Seattle we worked for my boyfriends aunt hauling cinder blocks for $15 an hour (connections are important!), in Oregon we found a job on a cannabis farm with 12,000 plants off craigslist for $12/hour or $150 a pound to trim (I made so much damn money on that farm I was able to pay off my massive credit card debt!). In California and Nevada we found work from a company called LaborReady although I think they changed the name to PeopleReady which gives you a job for a day and pays that day too, usually minimum wage. Some jobs we got through LaborReady was picking squash, unloading semi trucks, directing parking for a football game, and being walmart employees for the day. We always went to campgrounds or used an app called Couchsurfing, or stayed in hostels. sometimes we got a hotel if we were cold. My boyfriend is a mechanic so he did regular maintenance on my car, oil changes in walmart parking lots and such. We ended up doing the brakes and sparkplugs on the road as well. That saved us money and kept the Subaru running smoothly through all the abuse we put her through. It was a really beautiful time, best time of my life, I think about it all the time. We drove through rivers, camped under the stars, and made friends we still talk to to this day. We would have kept going too, but we were profiled in TX while camping and arrested for weed possession. Unfortunately it was a very backwards county in Texas and now we're riding out a four year probation sentence in our hometown. Its okay though - I started a 3.5 year masters degree program while I'm stuck here so everything works out \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af We're going to travel again as soon as we can leave the county!",
